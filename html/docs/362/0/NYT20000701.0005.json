John\nMica, R-Fla., accused the Mexican government of doing little to\nstem the drug trade.\n\n   ``They thumb their noses at our requests for interdiction and\nextradition of drug lords,'' he said.

Last year, customs agents manning 26 locations\nin San Diego and Imperial counties encountered 95 million people,\n30 million passenger vehicles and 1 million trucks, he said.\n\n   Logan credited much of the traffic increase to the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, which spurred a 115 percent rise in\nU.S.-Mexico trade from its enactment in 1994 through 1999.\n\n   The Customs Service is also monitoring increased smuggling of\nprescription drugs from Mexico to the United States, officials\nsaid.\n\n   Logan said Mexican pharmaceuticals, long a legal and low-cost\nalternative for American visitors filling their own needs, are now\nbeing smuggled in large quantities and distributed across the U.S.\nin a black market.\n\n   Drug smuggling and related violence have risen sharply in border\ndesert regions of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, said\nLuis Barker, chief agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector.\n\n   Barker testified that smugglers are increasingly paying\nundocumented immigrants to carry small quantities of illegal drugs\ninto the U.S., where they are turned over to distributors.\n\n   The officials also testified Friday that:\n\n   An estimated 50 percent of all cocaine now being distributed in\nthe United States is smuggled into Southern California from Mexico.\n\n   Methamphetamine labs in California, operated and supplied by\nMexican drug gangs, produce 85 percent of the nation's supply.\n\n   Those meth labs, called ``super labs'' for their huge output,\nstretch from San Diego to Sacramento along the I-5 corridor.\n\n   A flood of Mexican heroin has lowered street prices for a\none-milligram dose to $1 on average nationwide, compared to $3.90\nin 1980.\n\n   Mexican black-tar heroin is now much more addictive and potent -\n41.6 percent pure compared to 3.6 percent in 1980.
