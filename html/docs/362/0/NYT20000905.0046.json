A two-year, $2.3 million effort in Texas to clone an\naging pet border collie named Missy has yet to yield a whimper of\nsuccess.\n\n   But that's not for lack of trying. Groups and individuals far\noutside the scientific mainstream make no secret that they want to\nclone people. The religious cult's Clonaid project claims already\nto have its first paying customers, the parents of a deceased child\nwilling to pay to clone him.\n\n   Scientists and ethicists alike, however, say their bigger\nconcern is people-cloning projects that may be going forward\nwithout publicity.\n\n   And, amid the current wave of enthusiasm for cloning human\nembryos to obtain versatile ``stem cells'' for repairing the body,\nsome worry that the stage is being set for scientists to slide past\nsocial and legal bounds and eventually clone not just embryonic\ncells but entire human beings.\n\n   ``I absolutely think there's a bridge being built from one type\nof cloning to the other,'' said Peter Garretts, a spokesman for\nMATCH, a British anti-cloning group. ``I think the cloning of\nhumans is an inevitability,'' an opinion that many experts share.\n\n   MATCH's anxiety is prompted by the decision of a British\ngovernment advisory committee that recently called for allowing\nscientists to create human embryos through a cloning process, in\norder to obtain embryonic stem cells that could develop into any\ntissue of the body.\n\n   The panel firmly stated that these cloned embryos could be kept\nfor no more than 14 days: They would be discarded after the stem\ncells were removed. MATCH and other critics are concerned that some\nunethical scientist might instead place such an embryo into a\nwoman's uterus, where it could develop into a fetus to be born.\n\n   But, Dr. Liam Donaldson, Britain's chief medical officer, told\nthe London Observer recently: ``We're not talking about cloning\nwhole human beings; it's abhorrent, it's illegal. And we're not\ngrowing whole parts of the body, sitting in the lab growing arms\nand legs.''\n\n   Moreover, the British infertility industry is closely regulated\nby the government _ unlike its US counterpart _ and efforts to use\nthe created embryos to initiate a pregnancy would likely be caught,\nscientists say.\n\n   For people concerned about the possibility of human clones,\nhowever, there is plenty to keep a nervous eye on.\n\n   Even as the Pope last week denounced cloning and embryo\nresearch, the UFO-oriented religious group called the Raelian\nMovement said its cloning project, called Clonaid, would soon try\nto make a genetic copy of a young child who had died and whose\nparents were willing to pay the cost of the attempt.\n\n   Clonaid, formed in 1997, is based on the group's belief that\nlife on Earth was created by a race of human extraterrestrials\nusing DNA engineering: Jesus himself came into existence through\ncloning, the Raelians believe.\n\n   ``I don't think it should cost more than $500,000'' for a clone,\nClonaid's scientific director, Brigitte Boisselier, said in a\ntelephone interview.\n\n   Referring to the high failure rate of current methods of cloning\nand that many cloned animals are born with birth defects,\nBoisselier said, ``You need to be very careful. We have been\ndesigning a kind of DNA transfer that wouldn't cause damage to\nit.''\n\n   The unidentified couple who has requested the cloning, she\nadded, ``say they know this will not bring their baby back, but\nthey want to give his DNA a chance to express itself'' in a\ngenetically identical child.\n\n   Clonaid has four scientists on its team, but is still seeking an\nexisting lab, or a place to build one, in a country where cloning\nisn't yet outlawed, she said.\n\n   Such countries are becoming harder to find.\n\n   This year, Japan moved toward a cloning ban designed to sew up\nloopholes in existing regulations. The gaps came to light when\nRichard Seed, a physicist from Chicago, announced in 1998 he had\nraised financing to buy property in Japan to establish a cloning\nlaboratory.\n\n   Seed, who has three Harvard degrees but is not trained in\nreproductive science, is perhaps the most notorious would-be\ncloner. Several times after the birth of Dolly, Seed stirred alarm\nin scientific and legal circles by announcing plans to clone humans\n_ including himself and his wife.\n\n   Whether Seed has the expertise and can recruit capable\nscientists or raise sufficient funding has never been clear, but\nhis announcements forced the scientific community and lawmakers to\nconfront the possibility of human cloning.\n\n   Current rumors say the purported financing for his Japanese\nventure fell through. Last week, he did not return calls to his\nhome.\n\n   Perhaps the best-credentialed cloning enthusiast is an Italian\ninfertility expert, Dr. Severino Antinori, who heads an IVF clinic\nand said he has pioneered legitimate infertility treatments.\n\n   In a telephone interview from Rome last week, Antinori said he\nis experienced in both animal and human reproduction, and wants to\noffer cloning to men who have no sperm but desire a biologically\nrelated child. Italy, however, has a legal ban on human cloning.\n\n   ``I am very surprised that people in general say no to this,''\nsaid Antinori of the International Associated Research Institute\nfor Human Reproduction. He said he will discuss reproductive\ncloning with other infertility experts at a meeting in Budapest\nthis month.\n\n   Unlike normal reproduction, cloning perpetuates the genetic\nmaterial of only one individual, not two. Dolly, born at the Roslin\nInstitute in Scotland in 1996, was the first mammal cloned from an\nadult body cell.\n\n   In this type of cloning, the animal's genetic material _ the\nfull DNA complement in the nucleus of one cell _ is placed into a\nfemale individual's egg that has been stripped of all its DNA.\n\n   At that point, the experiment that produced Dolly showed that\nsomething almost miraculous occurs when an adult cell is\nsuccessfully cloned: The donor nucleus is ``reprogrammed'' so it is\nable to generate an entirely new individual from scratch. Rather\ntham having the same genetic age as the animal from which it was\nduplicated, the nucleus somehow was made young again, as if a clock\nwere rewound. As a result, it became once again fully active in all\nits genes and capable of developing into an entire individual.\n\n   Success in cloning Dolly from an adult ewe has led to similar\nfeats with calves, mice and _ most recently _ pigs. Monkeys,\nhowever, have not yet been cloned from adult cells, nor have dogs\nor cats.\n\n   Following close on the hoofsteps of Dolly's arrival, President\nBill Clinton issued an executive order banning federal funding of\nhuman cloning. A proposed federal law, however, failed to pass\nmainly because scientists were concerned it would hamper legitimate\nresearch.\n\n   Since then, four states _ Rhode Island, Michigan, California and\nLouisiana _ have passed cloning bans.\n\n   So far, ``it's really universal disapproval of cloning that is\npreventing scientists from getting involved,'' said Lori Andrews,\ndirector of the Institute for Science, Law and Technology at\nChicago-Kent College of Law.\n\n   Virtually no scientists, politicians or ethicists have a good\nword to say about cloning human individuals.\n\n   George Annas, professor of health law at Boston University,\nargued that cloning an existing human being ``is replication, not\nreproduction.'' It threatens human uniqueness, he said, and\ndevalues human life _ because the clone would be so much compared\nto the original person that it would be only a perpetual ``echo''\nof another person.\n\n   On the other hand, a California lawyer representing infertile\npeople argues that banning cloning interferes with a constitutional\nright to reproduce.\n\n   Mark Eibert challenges the notion that clones would be mere\ncarbon copies, pointing out the identical twins have striking\nindividuality though they are genetically the same. That's because\nenvironment and learning also shape personality.\n\n   Ultimately, Eibert told a California commission on cloning, the\nreal issue is who decides whether infertile people can reproduce by\ncloning _ the individual or the government?\n\n   Beyond the lawyers, there are members of the public who are\ndrawn to the possibilities, not so much to create the next Michael\nJordan as to fill an emotional need.\n\n   ``There's a big interest'' in cloning or related procedures\namong ``a lot of single women who have not found a partner, or the\nright partner, and still want a child biologically related to\nthem,'' said Dr. David Keefe, chief of infertility services at New\nEngland Medical Center and Women and Infant's Hospital in\nProvidence. In the absence of any proven human cloning method, he\nsaid, many of these women desperately want embryos created by\ncouples for IVF but not used, and kept on ice.\n\n   Ethicists argue about the merits and morality of human cloning,\nexperts debate whether there really is much interest in cloning\npeople, but for the moment, say Keefe and other specialists, those\nare moot points. Why? Because the risks of failure and\nabnormalities are too high, as the animal results show.\n\n   ``We know nothing about the safety'' of cloning humans, Keefe\nsaid. Animal clones have been born with oversized organs and\nmalfunctions, and there is debate about whether clones may\nprematurely age.\n\n   ``So it's possible that a cloned kid at 5 might develop\nAlzheimer's and get cancer'' and have symptoms of advanced age.\n``Show me one parent'' who would accept that risk in cloning, Keefe\nsaid. ``We should assume the worst _ because kids are too\nprecious.''\n","Headline":"\nARE WE GETTING CLOSER TO CLONING HUMAN BEINGS? \n","Text":["\n   They are unlikely pioneers, almost universally scorned and\ndoubted, yet vowing to embark on one of the boldest scientific\nexperiments ever.\n","\n   One is a religious cult that believes in UFOs and aliens whose\nleaders say they will soon try to clone cells from a recently\ndeceased young child.\n","\n   Another is a maverick physicist who shocked the world when he\nannounced in 1998 his plans to buy property in Japan to establish a\ncloning laboratory.\n","\n   Three years after the world learned of Dolly, the cloned sheep,\nno one has taken the dreaded and often-predicted further step, so\nfar as is known, of cloning a star athlete, dictator, or even a\nbeloved pet.
