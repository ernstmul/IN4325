Times News Service   \n\n   Meeting Cog for the first time can be an unsettling experience.\nCog, the creation of Rodney Brooks, the director of the Artificial\nIntelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, is a legless, human-shaped robot that looks like an\nungainly ancestor of R2D2.\n\n   When a visitor approaches, Cog swivels its head in a\ndisconcertingly human gesture, and stares him in the eye.\nInevitably, the visitor stares back, and for at least an instant\ngets the eerie sense that there has been a meeting of the minds.\n\n   ``Everybody overreacts as a matter of course,'' said Daniel\nDennett, a Tufts University philosopher who works with Brooks on\nCog. ``There's something really unsettling when Cog looks at you.''\n\n   So far, Cog's unsettling gaze is little more than a clever\nillusion, but Brooks and his graduate students believe that they\nhave taken the first important steps toward creating a truly\nintelligent machine.\n\n   The key to achieving human intelligence, Brooks believes, is to\nbuild a machine that experiences the world in much the way a human\nbeing does. This requires not only the ability to sense and\nmanipulate the physical world, but the social world as well, since\nfrom infancy on, almost all of what humans learn comes about from\nhuman reaction. And the first step, bridging the gap between humans\nand machines, is eye contact.\n\n   Despite the fact that he directs the world's largest artificial\nintelligence laboratory, Brooks is something of a maverick in the\nfield. ``Most of my colleagues here in the lab do very different\nthings and have only contempt for my work,'' he cheerfully\nadmitted.\n\n   The majority of artificial intelligence researchers pursue an\napproach that Brooks calls, Good Old-Fashioned Artificial\nIntelligence, or GOFAI. According to this approach, the best way to\nmake a computer that is as intelligent as a human is to cram it\nfull of knowledge about the real world and methods to manipulate\nit.\n\n   One of the foremost proponents of this approach is Dr. Douglas\nLenat, president and chief executive officer of Cycorp in Austin,\nTexas, and Brooks' former adviser. For more than a decade, Lenat\nand his team have fed more than a million facts into a program\ncalled Cyc. Most of these facts are matters of common sense: for\nexample, that glasses full of water usually should be carried\nrightside-up and that people generally stop buying things after\nthey die.\n\n   The problem with this tactic, Brooks feels, is that it is ``not\ngrounded anywhere.''\n\n   ``To me,'' Brooks said, ``it's like an intelligence which only\nhas access to a Korean dictionary. It has perfectly self-consistent\ndefinitions, but it's not connected to the world in any way.''\n\n   The schism in the artificial intelligence field represented by\nthese two approaches to building intelligent machines in some ways\nmirrors the split among educators. Traditional educators, like\nLenat, believe ``that intelligence is intimately tied up with\nhaving and being able to use knowledge.''\n\n   Brooks' approach is closer to that of educators like John Dewey,\nwho urged ``a philosophy of education based upon a philosophy of\nexperience.'' As Lenat puts it, ``We represent the `it's worth it\nto go to school' point of view, and he represents the `you can\nlearn stuff on your own' point of view.''\n\n   Before setting out to make a robot that could learn things on\nits own, Brooks spent more than a decade building robotic insects\nthat could freely scurry about and explore his laboratory. Other\nresearchers had done similar things, but their creations, which\nrelied on the ideas of GOFAI, were awkward and slow.\n\n   The legs of their insects were controlled by a central computer\nthat had a detailed three-dimensional map of the terrain and knew\nall the relevant laws of physics and strategies for setting goals.\nBrooks did away with the massive central processor. Instead, each\ninsect leg contains a small circuit that tells it to swing forward\nif the leg is in the air, to swing backward if it is on the ground,\nand not to lift if the adjacent leg is up, along with a few other\nsimilar facts.\n\n   ``It's all local computation physically coupled through the\nbody,'' Brooks said. Nevertheless, from the interaction of these\ncircuits, Brooks' insects spontaneously begin to walk with a gait\nvery similar to that taken by actual insects.\n\n   ``I had this plan,'' Brooks recalled. ``I was going to do\ninsects and then I was going to do an iguana. And then I was going\nto do maybe a simple mammal, then I was going to do a cat, then I\nwas going to do a monkey, and then I was going to do humans.'' The\nproblem with this plan, he soon realized, was that it would take\ntoo long; insects alone had taken him 10 years.\n\n   So he asked himself: ``Do I want to die being remembered as the\nguy who built the best artificial cat? No. So I decided to jump and\nsee where we could get. At least I'd be remembered as the foolish\nguy who was way overambitious.''\n\n   Over the past five years Brooks, with the help of six or seven\ngraduate students has begun to realize his ambitious dream. Today\nCog is a skeletal aluminum figure, with a swiveling, octagonal head\nperched on broad, motor-studded shoulders from which sprout a pair\nof powerful arms that end with simple, fingerless hands. The\nresearchers decided not to equip Cog with legs.\n\n   Â  \nnn\n\n   ``We're not sure what to do with a toddler strapped to a high\nchair, much less something that can walk around as well,'' said\nBrian Scassellati, one of Brooks' graduate students.\n\n   Cog's eyes consist of two pairs of video cameras _ one wide\nangle, the other with a narrower focus to simulate human vision,\nwhich is far more sensitive in the middle than on the edges. They\nmove much like human eyes move. The output of these cameras is\ndisplayed on a bank of amber monitors mounted on a rack behind the\nrobot.\n\n   Cog also has tiny microphone ears, gyroscopes that work much\nlike the inner ear to provide a sense of up and down, and various\nsensors to report the position of its limbs. With all this\nhardware, there is little room left for brains, so these _ a\nnetwork of Pentium computers _ are mounted in a nearby rack.\n\n   So far, Cog's achievements are modest, though impressive by the\nstandards of robotics. Cog can make eye contact, track motion by\nswiveling head and eyes, and even distinguish humans from other\nless interesting objects. It can make a Slinky gracefully cascade\nfrom hand to hand, turn a crank and it has even played drums in a\nrock video.\n\n   Robots programmed using the principles of GOFAI could probably\nperform these tasks too, but not with the human grace of Cog, its\ncreators say. For example, a visitor can halt Cog's playing with a\nSlinky by simply placing a hand gently on its arm; when the hand is\nremoved, Cog resumes its play.\n\n   Cog also has a younger sister named Kismet, a cartoon-cute\ncharacter with bushy eyebrows, pink ears, a pair of large blue\neyes, complete with eyelids, and a mouth she can open and shut. All\nof these endearingly childlike features are carefully calculated to\nevoke the maternal instincts of Kismet's human companions.\n\n   ``Kismet is essentially training the human to be a good\nteacher,'' said Cynthia Breazeal, a designer of Kismet. Kismet has\na simple set of moods _ for example, happiness, interest, anger,\nfear, disgust or surprise _ that she can express on her face.\n\n   Kismet also has a set of needs, like the need to be stimulated\nby people and toys, a need to interact, and a need to avoid\nfatigue. ``These drives are always changing in time,'' Dr. Breazeal\nexplains. ``When one need becomes very strong, behaviors such as\nfacial expressions that act to satiate that need become active.''\n\n   For example, playing with a toy might amuse Kismet for a while,\nwhich she shows by a happy expression _ eyes wide open, eyebrows\nup, ears perked. But then she becomes bored and her face begins to\ndroop. Like any good parent, Kismet's human companion now tries\ndesperately to see what else will amuse her and finally hits upon\nthe reliable standby of making funny faces. Kismet, who was craving\nsocial interaction, is appeased and begins to smile once again.\n\n   When speaking of Kismet and Cog, it is difficult to avoid the\ntrap of anthropomorphism. Even her creators do not claim that\nKismet possesses human emotions, but that does not mean that she\npossesses no emotions at all. ``Cog doesn't have all the sorts of\nconsciousness that a human infant, a dog or a bird has, but it has\nsome,'' Dr. Dennett said. ``It doesn't have all the rich, lush\nembellishments of human boredom, but it's probably pretty much in a\nstate that might inspire a zoo-goer to say `these snakes are bored,\naren't they?'''\n\n   It is to answer questions like these, rather than the thrill of\nbuilding a humanoid robot, that Brooks said he had undertaken his\noverambitious project. ``The goal of having humanoid robots?'' he\nsaid. ``Certainly from a science fiction point of view, I'd love\nit. To me it's a romantic notion. Whether that will make sense in\nany sociological, economic or other sense, I can't say at this\npoint.''\n\n   Brooks and his students want to be experimental philosophers,\nusing Cog as a platform to investigate theories of the human mind.\n``You look at some cognitive theory and there's a lot of\nhand-waving around the edge,'' Brooks said. ``When you try to put\nit in a robot, you have to get rid of the hand-waving and connect\nit up to the other stuff, which sharpens everyone's appreciation\nand understanding.''\n\n   Still, Brooks has a clear-cut criterion for success: ``I'll know\nthat I've succeeded when my graduate students feel bad about\nturning off the robot.''\n","Headline":"\nA MAN, A PLAN AND A ROBOT THAT MAKES EYE CONTACT \n","Text":["\n   Meeting Cog for the first time can be an unsettling experience.\nCog, the creation of Rodney Brooks, the director of the Artificial\nIntelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, is a legless, human-shaped robot that looks like an\nungainly ancestor of R2D2.\n","\n   When a visitor approaches, Cog swivels its head in a\ndisconcertingly human gesture, and stares him in the eye.\nInevitably, the visitor stares back, and for at least an instant\ngets the eerie sense that there has been a meeting of the minds.\n","\n   ``Everybody overreacts as a matter of course,'' said Daniel\nDennett, a Tufts University philosopher who works with Brooks on\nCog. ``There's something really unsettling when Cog looks at you.''\n","\n   So far, Cog's unsettling gaze is little more than a clever\nillusion, but Brooks and his graduate students believe that they\nhave taken the first important steps toward creating a truly\nintelligent machine.\n","\n   The key to achieving human intelligence, Brooks believes, is to\nbuild a machine that experiences the world in much the way a human\nbeing does.
