(bl) \nBy NICHOLAS WADE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Federally financed researchers will soon be able to work on\nhuman embryonic stem cells, the source cells from which the embryo\ndevelops, as a result of a ruling Tuesday by the Department of\nHealth and Human Services that a congressional ban on human embryo\nresearch does not apply to the cells.\n\n   The decision was hailed as ``an accurate interpretation of bad\nlaw,'' by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and\ndenounced by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as a\nloophole that ``violates the spirit of current law.''\n\n   In its ruling, the department's Office of General Counsel said\nthat because the cells by themselves do not have the capacity to\ndevelop into a human being, they cannot be considered embryos.\n\n   Human embryonic stem cells, isolated for the first time in\nNovember, are capable of developing into any of the body's cell\ntypes and thus have great potential for repairing any damaged\ntissue, such as failing heart muscles or the type of brain cells\nlost in Parkinson's disease.\n\n   The many biological researchers who receive their funds from the\nfederal government have been unable to study human embryonic stem\ncells because of a congressional ban, originating in the House,\nthat has been attached every year since 1995 to bills authorizing\nspending for the National Institutes of Health, the principal\nsupporter of biomedical research.\n\n   The ban states that no federal funds may be used for ``research\nin which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or\nknowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that\nallowed for research on fetuses in utero.'' In a statement issued\nin November, Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., said human embryonic stem\ncells should not be excluded from the ban.\n\n   The embryonic stem cells described in November by Dr. James\nThomson of the University of Wisconsin were derived in from human\nembryos created in surplus amounts in a fertility clinic. Deriving\nthe cells is legal, provided it is not done with federal funds. Dr.\nHarold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, said\nit would still be illegal for researchers to use federal funds to\nderive their own stem cells in this way. But they can now use\nfederal funds to work on the cells Thomson has already obtained.\n\n   ``The prospect of doing amazingly interesting science is really\nquite wonderful,'' Varmus said. But research cannot begin, he said,\nuntil the NIH has drawn up guidelines to ensure that researchers do\nnot do prohibited research, such as generating new embryos\n\n   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who in December called for speedy\nissuance of the ruling, said the decision would move researchers\ncloser to finding cures for many diseases. ``The government should\nnot issue blanket bans on medical research,'' he said.\n\n   But the circumstance that federally-supported scientists can now\nconduct research on cells that they cannot legally derive was\nseized upon by Richard Doerflinger, associate director for policy\ndevelopment at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. ``They\nwill destroy the embryos with private funds and experiment on the\ntissue with public funds,'' he said.\n\n   Doerflinger believes that the medical benefits expected from\nstem cell research could be obtained with embryonic stem cells\nderived from spontaneously aborted fetuses. A pocket of embryonic\nstem cells, known as embryonic germline cells, is preserved in the\nfetus as a source to generate egg or sperm cells. One of the two\nlines of embryonic stem cells announced last November was developed\nby Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, who obtained the\ncells from aborted fetuses, but they were induced abortions, not\nspontaneous ones.\n\n   Doerflinger said that Gearhart's type of human embryonic stem\ncells would be acceptable had they been obtained from spontaneously\naborted fetuses.\n\n   In a written statement he said, ``The Clinton administration now\nseeks to do indirectly what Congress has forbidden it do to\ndirectly: Provide federal support for research in which human\nembryos are created and destroyed.''\n","Headline":"\nCURB ON EMBRYO RESEARCH DOES NOT COVER STEM CELLS, AGENCY RULES\n","Text":["\n   Federally financed researchers will soon be able to work on\nhuman embryonic stem cells, the source cells from which the embryo\ndevelops, as a result of a ruling Tuesday by the Department of\nHealth and Human Services that a congressional ban on human embryo\nresearch does not apply to the cells.\n","\n   The decision was hailed as ``an accurate interpretation of bad\nlaw,'' by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and\ndenounced by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as a\nloophole that ``violates the spirit of current law.''\n","\n   In its ruling, the department's Office of General Counsel said\nthat because the cells by themselves do not have the capacity to\ndevelop into a human being, they cannot be considered embryos.\n","\n   Human embryonic stem cells, isolated for the first time in\nNovember, are capable of developing into any of the body's cell\ntypes and thus have great potential for repairing any damaged\ntissue, such as failing heart muscles or the type of brain cells\nlost in Parkinson's disease.\n","\n   The many biological researchers who receive their funds from the\nfederal government have been unable to study human embryonic stem\ncells because of a congressional ban, originating in the House,\nthat has been attached every year since 1995 to bills authorizing\nspending for the National Institutes of Health, the principal\nsupporter of biomedical research.\n","\n   The ban states that no federal funds may be used for ``research\nin which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or\nknowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that\nallowed for research on fetuses in utero.''
