(Science Times)  \n (af)  \n By NICHOLAS WADE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Two genetic surveys of human populations bring new evidence to\nbear on a pivotal event in prehistory, the first dispersal of\nmodern humans from Africa.\n\n   One study, based on analysis of people in East Africa and India,\nsuggests that the first emigration of modern humans was eastward,\ntoward Asia, and not northward through the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n   A second, drawing on DNA data from 50 ethnic groups around the\nworld, concludes that the ancestral population from which the first\nemigrants came may have numbered as few as 2,000 people.\n\n   Both studies point to the most recent common ancestor of the\nemigrants as having lived around 60,000 to 40,000 years ago.\n\n   Previous genetic studies have suggested 100,000 years or so for\nthe most recent common ancestor, and about 10,000 for the ancestral\npopulation size.\n\n   The younger date of around 50,000 years seems to tally much\nbetter with an emerging synthesis of the archaeological data\nrelating to human origins.\n\n   ``A combination of fossil and genetic evidence locates the\nancestral population in Africa, and archaeological discoveries\nimply an initial dispersal out of Africa about 50 ky years ago,''\nwrites Dr. Richard G. Klein of Stanford University in the latest\nedition of his book ``The Human Career.'' The term 50 ky means\n50,000 years ago.\n\n   Klein believes an important distinction can be discerned in the\narchaeological record between what he calls anatomically modern\nhumans and behaviorally modern humans. Though the fossil remains of\neach type look the same, a more advanced set of stone tools appears\nwith human remains dating back to 50,000 years or so.\n\n   Modern human sites older than this have a more primitive set of\nstone implements, similar to those used by archaic humans like the\nNeanderthals.\n\n   Klein and others believe that some major genetically-based\nneurological change, such as the development of language, occurred\naround 50,000 years ago. This transformation, he infers, was the\nspur that led behaviorally modern humans to innovate their\ncharacteristic suite of more advanced stone implements, develop the\nfirst forms of art, and spread throughout the world.\n\n   Remains of modern humans dating to about 100,000 years ago have\nbeen found at a well known archaeological site called Skhul in\nIsrael. The finding has been interpreted as evidence of the first\nhuman migration out of Africa, and it fitted with the old genetic\ndata of a modern human origin at this time.\n\n   But the Neanderthals occupied Europe and the eastern coast of\nthe Mediterranean at this time, and they or the cold climate may\nhave blocked any further advance in this direction.\n\n   Klein's data suggests that the humans of 100,000 years ago,\nanatomically modern but not like modern people in their behavior,\ndid not in fact spread out of Africa at this time.\n\n   A new genetic study, by Dr. Silvana Santachiara-Benerecetti of\nthe University of Pavia and colleagues, confirms the view that the\nfirst dispersal of modern humans was not until about 50,000 years\nago, and that the direction was eastward toward Asia.\n\n   The study, published in Nature Genetics last week, is based on\nmitochondrial DNA, the genetic material of the small\nenergy-producing organelles inside every cell. Because mitochondria\nare inherited with the egg, from the mother alone, their DNA\nescapes the shuffling that occurs in sexual reproduction, and any\nchanges reflect the occasional random mutation in the DNA.\n\n   On the basis of these mutations, biologists can construct a\nfamily tree of mitochondrial lineages and, by estimating the\nmutation rate, figure out the time that has elapsed since the\nmutation at the root of the tree.\n\n   Santachiara-Benerecetti and her colleagues studied a particular\npattern of mitochondrial DNA which is well known in India. They\nfound an earlier form of the pattern among people in Ethiopia,\nsuggesting that East Africa was its place of origin.\n\n   Signs of the pattern also exist among many people in Saudi\nArabia, but not among inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean.\nThis provides the first genetic evidence, the Italian biologists\nsay, that the human migration route out of Africa was from eastern\nAfrica along the coast toward Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\n   nn\n\n   Another new genetic study, by Dr. Marcus Feldman of Stanford\nUniversity and others, makes an interesting counterpart to the\nItalian study because it is based on a different kind of DNA but\nreaches similar conclusions.\n\n   Feldman and his colleagues looked at segments of the Y\nchromosome, another part of the human genome which escapes the\nusual shuffling of the reproductive process. Studying Y chromosomes\nfrom around the world, they conclude that the most recent common\nancestor of all these Ys was carried by a man who lived only 40,000\nyears or so ago.\n\n   Even though all Y chromosomes can be traced back to a single\nindividual, this does not mean a single Adam was the species' only\nmale representative. The founding population from which the world's\npresent population is derived consisted of about 2,000 individuals,\naccording to the new data, Feldman said. One Y chromosome in such a\npopulation will eventually dominate in the descendants after all\nthe other Y lineages are brought to a halt, whether because their\nowners have no children or beget only daughters.\n\n   The 40,000 year date, which has a large range of uncertainty, is\nmuch more recent than others, in part because these earlier\nestimates were forced to assume, quite unrealistically, that the\nsize of the human population has remained constant throughout\nprehistory. Feldman assumed an exponentially expanding population,\nwhich yields a more recent date of origin. His study is published\nin the current issue of the journal Molecular Biology and\nEvolution.\n\n   The two new studies represent a convergence of the genetic and\narchaeological data bearing on modern human origins, said Dr. Luca\nCavalli-Sforza, a leading population geneticist at Stanford\nUniversity. The two independent lines of evidence support the idea\nthat behaviorally modern humans arose in Africa around 50,000 years\nago from their anatomically modern forebears.\n\n   These behaviorally modern humans ``had three big improvements in\nculture _ language, boats or rafts, and Aurignacian technology,''\nCavalli-Sforza said, referring to the more sophisticated stone\nimplements.\n\n   Shortly after they had acquired these innovations, they burst\nforth to inhabit the rest of the globe. The Neanderthals who may\nhave blocked the human advance out of Africa 100,000 years ago were\nnow rapidly displaced in Europe, presumably by behaviorally modern\npeople invading Europe from Asia.\n\n   There are convincing dates, Cavalli-Sforza said, that humans\nreached Europe by 40,000 years ago and Oceania and New Guinea by\n40,000 to 50,000 years ago.\n\n   Although no boats from this period have yet been recovered, such\ncraft would have been essential transport for the early people who\nreached Australia, and Cavalli-Sforza said he was convinced that\n``the people who went from Africa to Asia know how to use some\nsimple navigational means.''\n","Headline":"\n2 GENETIC STUDIES FINDS MODERN HUMANS CAME FROM EAST AFRICA \n","Text":["\n   Two genetic surveys of human populations bring new evidence to\nbear on a pivotal event in prehistory, the first dispersal of\nmodern humans from Africa.\n","\n   One study, based on analysis of people in East Africa and India,\nsuggests that the first emigration of modern humans was eastward,\ntoward Asia, and not northward through the eastern Mediterranean.\n","\n   A second, drawing on DNA data from 50 ethnic groups around the\nworld, concludes that the ancestral population from which the first\nemigrants came may have numbered as few as 2,000 people.\n","\n   Both studies point to the most recent common ancestor of the\nemigrants as having lived around 60,000 to 40,000 years ago.\n","\n   Previous genetic studies have suggested 100,000 years or so for\nthe most recent common ancestor, and about 10,000 for the ancestral\npopulation size.\n","\n   The younger date of around 50,000 years seems to tally much\nbetter with an emerging synthesis of the archaeological data\nrelating to human origins.\n","\n   ``A combination of fossil and genetic evidence locates the\nancestral population in Africa, and archaeological discoveries\nimply an initial dispersal out of Africa about 50 ky years ago,''\nwrites Dr. Richard G.
