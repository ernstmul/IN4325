(af)  \n By NICHOLAS WADE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   A gene that confers fountain-of-youth properties on human cells\ngrown in laboratory glassware has been tested in mice to see if its\nabsence will cause the opposite effect, that of premature aging.\nThe answer _ which is partly yes _ sustains but does not yet\nfulfill the hope that manipulations of the gene will provide\ntreatments for cancer, heart disease and other maladies of aging\nhuman tissues.\n\n   Geron, the company that owns patents on the gene, said the new\nresult, reported in Friday's issue of Cell, bolstered its hopes for\nderiving treatments from the gene. Other experts said the\nexperiment, although a well executed and necessary step toward\nunraveling the mysteries of aging, was hard to interpret because of\nthe complexity of the subject and the early stage of research on\nthe gene.\n\n   ``It's going to create a great stir,'' Dr. Leonard Guarente, an\nexpert on aging at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said\nof the experiment, noting that the altered mice grew gray hair but\ndid not show many other symptoms of human aging. ``It mirrors aging\nin part, but not in whole.''\n\n   The gene is one that makes the critical component of an enzyme\ncalled telomerase.\n\n   Research into the cellular basis of aging, long an intractable\nfield, was rejuvenated in January of last year when biologists\nreported that human cells whose telomerase had been activated by\ninserting extra copies of the gene kept dividing well beyond the\nusual point _ some 50 divisions or so _ at which cells normally\nstop dividing and die.\n\n   Biologists refer to the cells as ``immortalized,'' because they\nseem capable of dividing indefinitely while maintaining their\nyouthful appearance. In a progress report in December, the altered\ncells were said to be still flourishing, with no sign of cancerous\ngrowth.\n\n   The reason telomerase has this effect in human cells is clear\nenough. The chromosomes _ the units in which the cell's genetic\nmaterial is packaged _ are protected at either end with long\nstretches of repetitive DNA called telomeres. Each time a normal\ncell divides, the telomeres get shorter, as if marking off the\npermissible number of divisions; when the telomeres reach a\ncritical minimum length, the cell starts to die.\n\n   Though all cells possess the genes to make telomerase, the\nenzyme that rebuilds shortened telomeres, in most cells the\ncritical telomerase gene is permanently switched off. This gene is\none that makes the template for the repeated DNA units of which\ntelomeres are composed.\n\n   Only in egg and sperm cells, in special regenerative cells\ncalled stem cells, and in cancer cells is the telomerase template\ngene active.\n\n   Immortalizing human cells is certainly an interesting feat, but\nwhat does that mean for people? Does the shortening of the\ntelomeres with age, in fact, have anything to do with the aging of\nthe body as a whole?\n\n   The experiment being reported Friday is the first effort to\nanswer the question as it applies to a whole organism, in this\ncase, mice. Dr. Ronald A. DePinho of the Dana-Farber Cancer\nInstitute in Boston, along with colleagues there and at other\ninstitutions, has worked with mice in which the critical telomerase\ngene has been deleted from the genome.\n\n   Mice, as it happens, have very long telomeres, and the first two\ngenerations of mice that lacked the telomerase template gene were\nunaffected by its lack.\n\n   DePinho and his colleagues have now bred third- to\nsixth-generation mice, with progressively shorter telomeres, and in\nthese mice, especially as they age, short telomeres are a problem.\n\n   The third-generation mice developed gray hair, male pattern\nbaldness and erosive skin lesions considerably more often than\nnormal mice of the same age. The sixth generation mice that lacked\ntelomerase displayed these symptoms at an earlier age, going gray\nat the age of 3 months.\n\n   On the other hand, the hearts, livers and kidneys of the mice\nwere normal, and they did not develop thinning of the bones or\ncataracts.\n\n   As to life span, the first to fifth generation mice that lacked\ntelomerase lived as long as normal mice, 50 percent of them living\nfor 24 months. Only in the sixth generation mice, with critically\nshort telomeres, was life span affected; half of these mice were\ndead at 18 months.\n\n   An obvious pattern in these results is that the tissues that\ndemand a steady proliferation of cells _ like skin and hair _ or\nthat need to regenerate under stresses _ like a wound healing _ are\nthe ones that are jeopardized by short telomeres.\n\n   A second important finding is that the mice with short telomeres\nhave a higher incidence of cancer, suggesting that short telomeres\ncan destabilize the cell and initiate tumors.\n\n   The question now is what relevance do these findings have to\naging and cancer in humans. On this point there is a wide range of\nopinion.\n\n   nn\n\n   Calvin B. Harley, Geron's chief scientific officer, said the\nDePinho article was ``very exciting from our perspective.''\n\n   ``It provides strong support,'' Harley continued, ``for what\nwe've been saying all along for the promise of telomerase in\ntreating aging and cancer.''\n\n   Geron, which has financed several advances in the telomere\nfield, but not DePinho's present work, hopes to add the telomerase\ngene to the cells of human tissues that have lost the capacity to\nproliferate.\n\n   Harley said the finding that short telomeres increase the risk\nof cancer was ``a major new piece of data that may explain why the\nfrequency of cancer goes up in old age.''\n\n   Other experts are not ready to concede that the relevance of the\nmouse results to human aging or cancer had been proved.\n\n   Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer expert at the Whitehead Institute\nin Boston, said the new report was ``very interesting'' and\n``validated the notion that telomere integrity is essential for\ncellular proliferation.''\n\n   The loss of proliferative capacity in telomere-deficient mice\ncould be the same process that occurs when human T-cells are\ndepleted in AIDS, but that and any other relation to human aging\nremains to be proved, in Weinberg's view.\n\n   ``The truth,'' Weinberg said, ``is, I don't know how many other\naspects of human aging are or are not connected the telomere\nshortening.''\n\n   Guarente also said it was too early to say whether the\ntelomere-deficient mice are an accurate model for some or any of\nthe aging processes seen in humans.\n\n   ``It is an extremely interesting study with possible relevance\nto human aging,'' Guarente said, ``but we'll need a lot more\ninformation before we can be certain of that relevance.''\n\n   DePinho is also cautious about interpreting his findings, saying\ntelomere attrition is one component of aging, which, along with\nother factors, affects the ability of an organism to withstand\nacute stress.\n\n   ``From these studies,'' he said, ``we've learned that if you can\nmaintain telomere function you are better able to maintain overall\nfitness, so I think that is very good news. But we aren't going to\nbe erecting any Ponce de Leon fountains around Geron. It won't\nreverse organismal aging as we know it.''\n\n   A difficulty in extending the findings from mice to people is\nthat mice evidently use the telomere system in a somewhat different\nway. Mice have very long telomeres and presumably the mice that die\na natural death die from causes other than telomere shortening _\nlike oxidative damage, accumulating genetic errors and the other\nkinds of wear and tear that probably play a role in human aging\ntoo.\n\n   With humans, telomeres are set much shorter, perhaps because\ncancer is a far more serious danger for a long lived species. Human\ntelomeres are short enough that a proliferating tumor cell will run\nout of telomeres before it gets to any significant size. Advanced\ntumors must subvert this last ditch defense by activating\ntelomerase.\n\n   But has evolution, in selecting the ideal limit for human\ntelomeres, had to make a trade-off between cancer prevention and\nlife span? In other words, do short telomeres ever limit human life\nspan by causing failure in aging tissues?\n\n   Geron scientists and other experts believe human cells in the\naged do get critically short of telomeres, particularly when high\ndemands are put on the proliferative capacity of skin or\nblood-forming cells.\n\n   But biologists like Weinberg argue that no one has yet been\nshown to have died of short telomeres, and that Geron's proposal to\nactivate telomerase in aging tissues could remove an important\ndefense against cancer.\n","Headline":"\nGENE STUDY BOLSTERS HOPE FOR TREATING DISEASES OF AGING \n","Text":["\n   A gene that confers fountain-of-youth properties on human cells\ngrown in laboratory glassware has been tested in mice to see if its\nabsence will cause the opposite effect, that of premature aging.\nThe answer _ which is partly yes _ sustains but does not yet\nfulfill the hope that manipulations of the gene will provide\ntreatments for cancer, heart disease and other maladies of aging\nhuman tissues.\n","\n   Geron, the company that owns patents on the gene, said the new\nresult, reported in Friday's issue of Cell, bolstered its hopes for\nderiving treatments from the gene.
