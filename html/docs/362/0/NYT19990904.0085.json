Those long-neglected\ninventors of smarter mousetraps will at last get their calls\nreturned. Smarter cats will be needed. And everyone will have a\nlist of humans who might benefit, starting perhaps with the\nbaseball umpires or, in the case of most evolutionists, with the\nKansas Board of Education.\n\n   Pleasant as it may be to contemplate a smarter world, there are\nserious quandaries in enhancing human abilities, as well as in\ntrying to raise the intelligence of animals, possibilities raised\nlast week by Princeton biologist Joe Tsien and his colleagues when\nthey announced they had developed a genetically smarter strain of\nmice.\n\n   In mice, monkeys and probably humans, nature has engineered a\ndeliberate fading of memory with age. The brain cell receptor that\nhelps associate two events _ the basic mechanism of memory _ is\nmade of components that change over a life span, making the\nreceptor less efficient in older animals. It is this process that\nwas counteracted in Tsien's mice. He genetically engineered the\nmice so that their brain cells produced more copies of the youthful\ncomponent of the memory receptor, thus enhancing its performance.\n\n   The receptor was souped up in brain cells throughout the mice's\nforebrain and hippocampus, a brain module that helps mice remember\nplaces (and humans to recall places and faces). The altered mice\ndid better than normal mice on six standard tests of rodent\nintellectual performance, like remembering where to find a hidden\nplatform when dropped into a bucket of murky water, or recognizing\nnew objects. Because the improvement was consistent in all the\ntests, for which the mice had to use many different areas of the\nbrain, Tsien concluded that in improving the basic mechanism of\nmemory he had also enhanced the mice's learning ability and general\nintelligence.\n\n   Tsien and other scientists are far from sure that tweaking the\nmemory receptor would be similarly helpful in the more complicated\nhuman brain. After all, with too retentive a memory you might\nclutter up your mind with all kinds of things you'd be better off\nforgetting. Still, scientists agree that the receptor is a\npromising place for intelligence enhancement to start.\n\n   But would the improvement of human acumen dangerously flout\nnature's wisdom? After all, intelligence is so precious for\nsurvival that surely nature makes every animal as smart as possible\nwithout transgressing some pivotal balance.\n\n   This doesn't seem to be the case, however, at least with\nlaboratory mice. Tsien's strains are smarter than their normal\ncousins, without any visible drawback. And behaviorally, modern man\nis so new a species _ 50,000 years is the blink of an eye in\nevolutionary time _ that perhaps the forces of natural selection\nhave scarcely had the chance to make the most of the human brain's\ncapacities.\n\n   Still, genetic engineers must surely pause at the fact that\nnature has designed memory to become less retentive with age. The\ndanger of tampering with this system is that the brain's memory\nstorage room could quickly be overwhelmed if learning were to\ncontinue at the same rate in adult life as in youth, suggestsDr.\nCharles Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute in La\nJolla, Calif. He believes the brain's capacity, vast as it is, must\nhave limits. The human brain has 100 billion neurons, and each\nneuron makes about 1,000 connections with other neurons, giving a\npotential 100 trillion units of memory. ``So there is enormous\nstorage capacity, but we don't know how much we need,'' Stevens\nsaid.\n\n   Even if the limit of that storage capacity is never reached in a\nhuman lifetime, the increasing access time needed to scan a growing\nstore of knowledge may be one reason why nature arranges for\ninformation to be acquired more slowly once the youthful thirst for\nknowledge has passed. What a powerful threat to deploy against\none's children _ learn it or lose it.\n\n   Despite the risk of running out of space on one's mental hard\ndrive, the temptation to try to enhance intelligence by promoting\nthe youthful form of the memory receptor will doubtless prove\nirresistible. Drugs might be developed to target the nerve cell\nsystem that Tsien altered by genetic means. Gene therapy could one\nday supply smart genes to an embryo _ or even to adults, since the\nhippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain that generates new\ncells throughout adult life.\n\n   Three categories of people might benefit: the medically ill, the\nelderly and everybody else. Ethicists see no problem in trying to\ntreat memory deficits in patients with brain diseases, which would\nbe no different from any other medical intervention. Helping older\npeople remember better is also likely to be uncontroversial,\n``because in our culture we see old age as something like a disease\nrather than as natural life process,'' said Dr. Victoria Sharpe, a\nbioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y.\n\n   A drug to enhance the intelligence of healthy individuals sounds\ngreat for job interviews or quiz programs. But if the smart pill\nwere costly, it could worsen social inequities. And such a drug\ncould easily be abused by parents. ``I think we will have to think\nthrough our social policies very carefully so we don't get into an\nenhancement race among parents and don't in effect develop a new\nkind of child abuse,'' said Dr. Leroy Walters, director of the\nKennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.\n\n   nn\n\n   Walters said it would be ``a plausible and morally justifiable\napplication of genetic techniques'' to raise the intelligence of a\nchild with very low IQ scores, because that could be regarded as\nremedial, but enhancing the IQ of someone at or above the mean\nwould be much more controversial, in his view.\n\n   The ethical implications extend beyond humans. Well before\nanyone tries to increase human intelligence, the technique will be\ntested in monkeys or chimpanzees. A smarter chimp might help answer\nthe enduring question of whether animals are conscious or whether\nconsciousness is only attained by brains with the capacity for\nlanguage. But how much smarter can chimpanzees get before they\nmerit, or even demand, special rights?\n\n   ``Say we produce a chimp that is more intelligent than people,''\nsaid Sharpe. ``I think we would probably just try to enslave it\nrather than welcome it into the human community. It may be a\ncynical view but I don't think we are very good at according moral\nstatus to nonhumans.''\n\n   Pioneers like Tsien are eager to explore the new possibilities\ncreated by genetic engineering. Nature may be wise, but it often\ndoesn't act in the individual's best interest, he notes. The body's\ncells don't have to rust and wear out like cars: they could renew\nthemselves indefinitely. Since nature lets us die, Tsien believes,\nit may also have neglected to make humans as smart as they can be .\n\n   He finds it hard to understand the recent flurry of apprehension\nabout human cloning, because a clone, being an exact genetic copy,\nadds nothing new to the world. But making an individual more\nintelligent would be novel and interesting. ``Everyone wants to be\nsmart,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nTHE HIDDEN TRAPS IN FOOLING MOTHER NATURE \n","Text":["\n   Now that researchers have shown that mice can be made smarter, a\nwhole world of opportunities opens up.
