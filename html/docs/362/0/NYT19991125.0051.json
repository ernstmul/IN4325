It's now hoped that the trade deal\nsigned last week by Washington and Beijing will create a more level\nplaying field.\n\n   However, no one expects changes to come overnight.\n\n   ``This is going to be a huge, huge challenge,'' said Anne Craib,\ndirector of international trade for the Semiconductor Industry\nAssociation. ``Anyone who thinks everything has been solved has\nnever been to China.''\n\n   By that, she means Chinese authorities have a track record of\npromising the moon and delivering little more than green cheese.\nCase in point: The Clinton administration reached an agreement with\nBeijing in 1995 for protection of intellectual property rights. But\naside from a handful of highly publicized closures of pirate CD\nfactories, little came of the pact. Most pirates simply changed\nlocations and stepped up production.\n\n   The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that at\nleast 90 percent of the CDs sold in mainland China are pirated\nversions, costing U.S. music companies approximately $80 million in\nannual losses.\n\n   The rip-off of the U.S. film industry is even greater. The\nMotion Picture Association estimates that pirated versions of\nAmerican films cost Hollywood about $120 million a year in lost\nrevenue.\n\n   `` `Mulan,' the Disney picture, bombed at the box office in\nChina because the tapes were available on the street before the\nfilm hit theaters,'' observed Jack Valenti, the association's\nchairman.\n\n   The software industry, meanwhile, says no fewer than 95 percent\nof applications on Chinese computers are pirated _ a figure\nsurpassed only by Vietnam's 98 percent rate.\n\n   ``Piracy is a real steep mountain to climb,'' said Mario Correa,\ntrade policy manager for the Business Software Alliance, which\nincludes Bay Area firms such as Autodesk and Adobe Systems. ``But\nyou have to start somewhere.''\n\n   China's new pact with the United States is seen as just such a\nstart.\n\n   The accord will cut tariffs on industrial and agricultural\ngoods, and allow easier market access for U.S. financial\ninstitutions, insurers and telecommunications firms.\n\n   And it brings China a big step closer to its long-held goal of\njoining the WTO, which sets the rules for global commerce and\nmediates disputes among its 135 member countries.\n\n   Beijing now needs to cut similar deals with the European Union,\nCanada and other nations. At the same time, the U.S. Congress must\ngrant China permanent ``normal trade relations'' status, which\nwon't come easily, given next year's election and the media's focus\non Chinese political repression.\n\n   Already, the AFL-CIO and other labor groups have sworn to fight\nChina's entry into the WTO, and the textile industry has said it\nwill lobby hard on Capitol Hill to protect safeguards for its\nproducts.\n\n   For its part, the tech business will push for Congress to give\nits blessing to the U.S.-China pact and to China's WTO accession.\n\n   ``This may be one of the biggest lobbying efforts in recent\nhistory,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the Electronic\nIndustries Alliance, a confederation of tech and telecom groups.\n``We're organizing like never before.''\n\n   ``The public and members of Congress will have to be educated on\nthis,'' said Jennifer Guhl, director of international trade policy\nfor the American Electronics Association, which represents about\n3,000 high-tech corporations.\n\n   It's easy to understand why the tech industry is pushing so\nhard.\n\n   China's tech market is only about one-tenth the size of\nAmerica's. But sales of personal computers on the mainland are\nexpected to double over the next five years, and are projected to\nequal American PC sales by 2010.\n\n   By the same year, China is likely to have the world's\nsecond-largest semiconductor market, after the United States.\n\n   Last week's accord covered just about everything on the tech\nindustry's wish list. For example, U.S. companies in China now will\nbe able to import and distribute their own goods, rather than being\nforced to use state-run firms as intermediaries.\n\n   An important condition laid down by Washington was for China to\nbecome a signatory of the Information Technology Agreement, a\nseparate treaty that calls for most tariffs on tech products to be\neliminated by 2000. The agreement affects $500 billion in annual\nglobal technology trade, including as much as $100 billion in U.S.\nexports.\n\n   For companies such as Santa Clara chipmaker Intel Corp. and San\nJose's Cisco Systems, such changes will vastly improve efficiency\nand profitability in their dealings with mainland China.\n\n   But China retreated from an earlier pledge to allow U.S.\ncompanies to hold 51 percent stakes in mainland telecommunications\nventures. Instead, Beijing drew the line at 50 percent ownership,\nthus barring foreign firms from holding a majority position.\n\n   Now comes perhaps the hardest part: getting China to comply with\nthe terms of the deal. Many in the business community hope that the\ncarrot of WTO membership will compel the Chinese to abide by\ninternational conventions regarding patents and copyrights.\n\n   ``It will make a huge difference when multilateral pressure is\nbrought to bear on China,'' said the American Electronics\nAssociation's Guhl. ``It will hold China to its commitments.''\n\n   But Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a persistent critic of the\nBeijing regime, is highly dubious about Chinese compliance.\n\n   ``Once you give China permanent normal trade relations status,\nthere's no turning back,'' she said. ``We're relinquishing our\nleverage. Once they're in (the WTO), and if they don't comply, we\ncan file a complaint. ... And then what? Nothing. And then\nnothing.''\n\n   Craib and other industry leaders agree that WTO membership would\nnot be a quick fix for the various obstacles faced by foreign\ncompanies in China. For example, Craib estimated that 80 percent of\nmicrochips in the country are smuggled in illegally by parties\nseeking to avoid taxes and tariffs.\n\n   In a sign of how systemic such problems have become, it has been\nwidely reported that the powerful Chinese military is one of the\nleading purveyors of smuggled goods.\n\n   ``WTO is not a magic wand that's going to eliminate these\nproblems overnight,'' Craib said. ``But it would be worse to just\nlet things go and not do anything at all.''\n\n   While the concessions China has made will help Congress feel\nmore comfortable conferring normal trade relations status, it won't\nbe easy for the trade deal's backers to overcome opponents'\nobjections to China's human- and labor-rights policies and the\nwell-entrenched interests of the textile industry.\n\n   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, a fierce critic of the\nU.S.-China pact, vowed last week to muster thousands of union\nmembers and environmentalists for a huge march in Seattle on\nTuesday.\n\n   ``We will call upon the (WTO delegates) to address workers'\nrights and human rights as well as environmental and consumer\nprotections in the rules that govern the global economy,'' he said.\n\n   Pelosi had harsh words for Clinton, saying: ``The president\nwants to redeem his failed China policy, which hasn't accomplished\nanything. It's this big cosmetic thing, but he won't have to deal\nwith the ramifications because he'll be out of office by then.''\n\n   She added, ``If there's ever an argument for campaign finance\nreform, if there's ever a gravy train, it's the corporate lobby for\nChina.''\n\n   The Electronic Industries Alliance's McCurdy acknowledged that\nstruggle lies ahead: ``Just because we have an agreement doesn't\nmean it's all done.''\n","Headline":"\nWTO DEAL WITH CHINA MAY CUT INTO PIRACY, SMUGGLING\n","Text":["\n   They certainly have little left to lose.\n","\n   The state's high-tech and entertainment industries already are\ndeprived of many millions of dollars in China each year because of\npiracy, smuggling and red tape.
