Many scientists believe\nthe cells will eventually be harnessed in unprecedented ways to\nrepair damaged and diseased tissue throughout the body.\n\n   ``We share the enthusiasm of others that (stem cell research)\nwill offer the real possibility for cures and treatments for many\ndiseases for which adequate therapies do not exist,'' says the\nreport.\n\n   But the working group of the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science recommends against allowing public funds to\nbe spent in destroying embryos to obtain the stem cells. The cells\ncould be extracted from human embryos in the private sector; once\ntransferred to laboratory dishes, the cells could be used in\npublicly funded research, says the AAAS report.\n\n   The source of the cells remains a controversial issue because\nhuman embryos are destroyed in the process of isolating the stem\ncells from them.\n\n   One logical source of embryonic cells would be the surplus\nembryos created through in vitro fertilization that infertile\ncouples no longer planned to use.\n\n   The AAAS report also said there was no need to create new\nregulatory mechanisms for stem cell research. The research itself\nraises no new ethical or policy issues, and oversight by the\ngovernment's existing Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee would be\nadequate, the report said.\n\n   The preliminary report of the AAAS working group is to be\nreleased publicly Wednesday at a Washington hearing on the issue.\nThe final version is to be completed within a few weeks, said\nAudrey Chapman, an AAAS official who co-directed the study.\n\n   She said the timing was aimed at providing ``an informed set of\nrecommendations'' in advance of expected congressional debate on\nthe issue of funding stem cell research. The working group included\nscientists, physicians, religious scholars, ethicists, and\nrepresentatives of patients' groups.\n\n   Some conservative lawmakers have vowed to prevent public funding\nbecause the embryonic cells can only be obtained from human embryos\nor aborted fetuses.\n\n   Actually there are three types of human stem cells: embryonic\nstem cells, which are found in the days-old embryo; embryonic germ\ncells, which are similar but are obtained from a fetus; and adult\nstem cells, which exist in adult tissues and can develop into some,\nbut not all, types of human cells.\n\n   Evan Snyder, a researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston and\nHarvard Medical School, who is investigating the potential use of\nadult stem cells in the brain to treat neurological diseases,\nagreed with the AAAS report that public funding of the work is\ncrucial.\n\n   ``Not only does the government have more money than private\nsources, if (support) comes from the federal government the public\nwill hopefully find that the work has been done in a scientifically\nrigorous way, and not just to have a product at the end,'' said\nSnyder.\n\n   Although the first isolation of the embryonic cells was reported\nonly last year, their scientific and medical potential has\nattracted great interest among scientists, said Snyder. ``Everyone\nin every discipline is beginning to wonder, what can stem cells\noffer to my field, or my interest?''\n\n   In addition to the AAAS working group, the stem cell issue is\nbeing reviewed by the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC)\nand the National Institutes of Health, which contends that public\nfunding is legal but is in the process of setting up guidelines for\nstem cell research.\n\n   In a preliminary report in July, NBAC agreed that it would be\nproper to spend federal funds on stem cell research, but, unlike\nthe AAAS working group, NBAC recommended setting up a new oversight\nand review panel specifically to review stem cell research.\n","Headline":"\nGROUP RECOMMENDS USE OF PRIVATE FUNDS TO PRODUCE STEM CELLS \n","Text":["\n   Federal funds should be used to speed research and development\nof human embryonic stem cells for a variety of potential treatments\nand cures, says a preliminary report from the nation's largest\nscientific group on the controversial issue.\n","\n   The versatile cells, which are formed soon after conception, can\nchange into any type of cell in the body.
