They played only supporting roles in\nthe bust.\n\n   What was called the most sophisticated immigrant-smuggling\noperation in the nation's history had operated under their noses\nand delivered as many as 300 Indian nationals per month into\nFlorida. These were not Cubans, Haitians or Central Americans who\nmight easily blend into South Florida.\n\n   In battling the smugglers, the U.S. Border Patrol shoulders a\nlogistical disadvantage in Florida: the number of agents here\nhasn't increased in 10 years.\n\n   Meanwhile, the number of agents nationwide has more than doubled\nduring the past five years to nearly 8,000.\n\n   ``We keep asking,'' said Billy G. Kring, who retired as the\nsector's chief in December, ``but we never get any agents.''\n\n   Almost all the new agents are dispatched along the Mexican\nborder, where the Immigration and Naturalization Service says\nthey're needed most.\n\n   Nonetheless, about 12,000 people illegally enter Florida from\nthe sea each year, Kring estimates.\n\n   ``We catch maybe 10 percent.''\n\n   Michael Sheehey, acting Border Patrol chief in Miami, inherits\nthe decade-old task of deploying about 60 agents over a territory\nthat encompasses Florida, Georgia and the two Carolinas. Manpower\nis spread thin.\n\n   At times, the agency improvises.\n\n   Operation Parai'so (Paradise) exemplified the slight-of-hand\nstrategy. It began June 1 as an attempt to stop smugglers who were\ndropping off Cubans on the 110 miles of beaches along the Florida\nKeys. It succeeded largely because of perceptions.\n\n   ``Word was out that we had 200 men'' patroling the Keys, Kring\nrecalled.\n\n   Actually, the operation numbered three agents working out of a\nTavernier condo. They cruised the marinas, boat landings and\nhighways. To residents unaccustomed to seeing such patrols, the\nKeys seemed to be crawling with agents. No agents are stationed\nthere on a regular basis.\n\n   The summer-long operation, which cost only $48,000, was designed\nto force smugglers to head north to Dade, Broward and Palm Beach\ncounties, where beachfronts are lined with homes and condominiums.\nThe Border Patrol relies on the beach communities and their police\nto sound the alarm when boatloads of migrants arrive.\n\n   An even more valuable ally is the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n   ``Without their presence, I don't think there would be a square\nfoot of beach without somebody on it arriving from another\ncountry,'' Kring said.\n\n   On a typical day, the Coast Guard deploys at least two 110-foot\npatrol boats in the Florida Straits and aircraft above, said Lt.\nCommander Mark Woodring of the Miami Coast Guard District. About 6\npercent of the Coast Guard budget, or $177 million, is spent on\nintercepting migrants.\n\n   Most of the vessels stopped last year _ 102 of them _ carried\nCubans. By comparison, patrol boats intercepted 14 vessels\ntransporting Dominicans and 11 with Haitians.\n\n   INS estimates at least 350,000 illegal immigrants live in\nFlorida, and the number sneaking ashore surged last year. More and\nmore of them paid smugglers to help them.\n\n   And for good reason. Smugglers generally have powerful boats\nthat can evade the Coast Guard. They also carry cell phones and\nglobal positioning satellite devices to deliver passengers to\nspecific locations where get-away vehicles await them. Some have\neven called from off-shore to summon taxis.\n\n   Freezing the numbers of agents in Florida for a decade yielded a\npredictable result: agents nab about the same number of smugglers\neach year.\n\n   During the past five years, agents referred an average of 28\ncases of smuggling or harboring illegal aliens to prosecutors in\nSouth Florida annually, according to Justice Department records\ncompiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at\nSyracuse University.\n\n   A small cadre within the Border Patrol and the INS investigates\nsmuggling.\n\n   The Border Patrol in Miami has eight agents in its\nanti-smuggling unit for the four states it covers. They spend about\n$1 million a year.\n\n   INS in Miami also has a tiny anti-smuggling unit, which\nconcentrates on illegal entry through ports and airports.\n\n   Occasionally, Washington acknowledges the manpower problem. For\nexample, INS officials last year singled out Miami International\nAirport in a budget report. The agency called for the hiring of 281\nnew inspectors for airports across the nation. Additional\ninspectors would ``ensure full staffing'' at Miami, they wrote.\n\n   Local INS officials declined to say whether more inspectors at\nthe airport could have uncovered the massive smuggling operation of\nIndian nationals that ended with the bust last November.\n\n   Seafaring smugglers, such as those who made last weekend's\ndisastrous crossing that claimed the lives of at least 15 Haitians,\nmake headlines and TV soundbites. But most people smuggled into\nFlorida travel in vans, buses and trucks across the northern\nborder, Border Patrol officials explain. Smugglers deliver them to\njobs in the citrus groves and vegetable fields.\n\n   About 125,000 migrant workers spill into farms in an\neight-county region covered by the Border Patrol station in West\nPalm Beach. About 80 percent of the workers illegally entered the\ncountry, estimates Art Bullock, agent in charge of the office.\n\n   Field hands from Central America arrive each growing season. The\nBorder Patrol started Operation One-Way about three years ago after\ndiscovering that smugglers used trucks and vans rented for a\none-way trip to Florida.\n\n   ``This office probably devotes 70 percent of its time to alien\nsmuggling,'' he said.\n\n   Pursuing smugglers falls to the five agents and two\ninvestigators assigned to the office.\n\n   ``This station would probably need 40 to 60 new men to do it\nright,'' Bullock said.\n\n   Growers don't hire workers directly. They get them through the\n4,500 licensed labor contractors who operate in the state.\n\n   Unscrupulous contractors hire workers smuggled here through\nnetworks operating in Texas, Arizona and other border states. About\n1,000 workers are smuggled across Florida's northern border each\nweek during the growing season, agents estimate.\n\n   Advocates for migrant workers blame the INS and Border Patrol\nfor the large number of undocumented field hands in the state. They\ncomplain that INS inspections occur only at the end of the growing\nseason, allowing farm owners to reap the benefit of the cheap\nlabor.\n\n   Acting Chief Sheehey says it's a misconception that the Border\nPatrol looks the other way. It's just that his office's budget\nisn't approved by Washington until the busiest time of the year for\ngrowers.\n\n   In other words, the agency cannot enforce the law because it\nruns out of money.\n\n   Once the agency's budget is approved, it focuses on its most\npressing cases. Undocumented farm workers might not be high on the\nlist.\n\n   At times, the backlog is overwhelming. Agents have been known to\nwork 12-hour shifts at stretches of six days a week. Those assigned\nto the West Palm Beach station are virtually always on call.\n\n   In Washington's eyes, the cash and manpower dedicated to\nfighting migrant smuggling in Florida is measured in the context of\nnational priorities. And South Florida's migrant smuggling problem\nisn't a top priority.\n\n   ``No question that the Miami district doesn't have the resources\nit needs,'' said Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington.\n``But you must put your resources where the most serious problem\nis.''\n\n   Consequently, planners developed a strategy in 1993 to\nconcentrate attention on the nation's southwest border. About 90\npercent of all illegal entries occur there.\n\n   Last year, Congress gave the INS $125 million to hire 1,000 new\nBorder Patrol agents. Nearly all of them were to be assigned to\nCalifornia, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.\n\n   The INS also initiated Operation Global Reach in June 1997 to\nprod other countries to crack down on smugglers. INS officers were\nsent to 13 foreign cities to promote cooperation and encourage them\nto identify and prosecute smugglers.\n\n   The list of cities included five in Central and South America,\nas well as Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Kingston, Jamaica. However,\nthe program neglected to include any Bahamian cities, which serve\nas safe havens for migrant smugglers. West End, in the Bahamas, was\nthe departure point for the Haitians who drowned last weekend.\n\n   Also in 1997, the INS announced it would create a list of the 10\nmost wanted alien smugglers. But the list was never developed, an\nINS spokesman said.\n\n   Last October, then Gov.
