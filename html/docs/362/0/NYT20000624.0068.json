Times News Service   \n\n   UNITED NATIONS _ Trafficking in people is now the\nfastest-growing business of organized crime, and it is being run by\nnew, barely understood networks that have sidelined traditional\ncriminal syndicates, the top anti-crime official at the United\nNations said last week.\n\n   Pino Arlacchi, an Italian sociologist who worked closely on\nfighting the Mafia before becoming director general of the U.N.\nOffice for Drug Control and Crime Prevention three years ago, said\nin an interview Thursday that the tragic deaths last week of 58\nChinese migrants trying to reach Britain was ``just the tip of the\niceberg, and one of several recent accidents that show the\nmagnitude and seriousness of the problem.''\n\n   He said reliable estimates indicate that 200 million people may\nnow be in some way under the sway or in the hands of traffickers of\nvarious kinds worldwide.\n\n   He said that while four centuries of slavery moved about 11.5\nmillion people out of Africa, in the last decade more than 30\nmillion women and children may have been trafficked within and from\nSoutheast Asia for sexual purposes and sweatshop labor.

We have also a lot of\nexploitation of migrants. And we have classic slavery.\n\n   ``If you put all this together under the same concept, you get\nthe biggest violation of human rights in the world,'' he said.\n\n   Among the proposals he is making to governments is that\nanti-slavery laws be reintroduced where they have lapsed or been\ntaken off the books.
