Times News Service   \n\n   At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of\ncreating hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National\nBioethics Advisory Commission at its meeting Tuesday in Miami, but\nat least in the public portion of their discussion, none of the\ncommissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid\ncells.\n\n   Clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the\ncommission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro of Princeton University.\nClinton said he was ``deeply troubled'' by news that Advanced Cell\nTechnology, a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., had\ncreated the hybrid cells. The company proposes to use the technique\nto take any body cell from a patient, return it to its embryonic\nform and use it to grow any of a variety of body tissues for\npossible transplant back into the patient.\n\n   One advantage of the technique is that the patient would receive\ntissues made from his own cells. Another is that no cells would be\ntaken from human embryos or fetuses.\n\n   Noting that scientists had been fusing together cells of\ndifferent origin for years, Dr. David Cox of Stanford University, a\nmember of the commission, said, ``We should tell the president\nthere is nothing new in cells fused from different eggs.''\n\n   The hybrid cow-human cells consist of the nucleus of a human\ncell inserted into a cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed.\nFactors in the cow egg are thought to make the human cell nucleus\nrevert to its embryonic form. Because the proteins of a cell turn\nover rapidly, the cow proteins are expected to be rapidly replaced\nby human proteins. The mitochondria of the cell, however, are\nlikely to remain cowlike, giving rise at least initially to cells\nthat are not wholly human.\n\n   An outside expert who spoke to the commission by telephone,\nRalph Brinster, a physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania,\nsaid of the cow-human hybrid cell, ``Most scientists would not\nregard it as a chimera.'' Chimeras are animals made from the cells\nof two different individuals by injecting the embryonic cells of\none into the embryo of another.\n\n   Making human chimeras is widely regarded as unethical.\n\n   Dr. Michael West, president of Advanced Cell Technology,\nattended the commission's meeting and was invited speak. In\nresponse to questions, he said he did not believe the cells formed\nin his procedure, called embryonic stem cells, were capable of\nforming a fetus if transferred to a uterus, something he said he\nhad no intention of doing.\n\n   Asked how he would prevent the technique from being misused,\nsuch as in cloning a person, he suggested that the cloning of\nhumans should be made a crime.\n\n   The commission members said they would draft a reply to Clinton.\n","Headline":"\nHUMAN-COW HYBRID CELLS ARE TOPIC OF ETHICS PANEL \n","Text":["\n   At the request of President Clinton, the ethical implications of\ncreating hybrid human-cow cells were discussed by the National\nBioethics Advisory Commission at its meeting Tuesday in Miami, but\nat least in the public portion of their discussion, none of the\ncommissioners voiced concern about the creation of the hybrid\ncells.\n","\n   Clinton requested the discussion last week in a letter to the\ncommission's chairman, Dr. Harold Shapiro of Princeton University.\nClinton said he was ``deeply troubled'' by news that Advanced Cell\nTechnology, a small biotechnology company in Worcester, Mass., had\ncreated the hybrid cells.
