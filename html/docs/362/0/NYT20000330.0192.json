The Chinese government also has\nbanned the Falun Gong, a spiritual meditation movement with\nthousands of followers, arresting more than 35,000 of its members\nand burning its books and videotapes. China also has required all\ncorporate Internet users in Shanghai to register with police.\n\n   Jendrezejczyk, in an interview, said Congress should require\nChina to ratify two United Nations human rights treaties\nguaranteeing freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right\nto organize trade unions, among other rights, before approving\npermanent normal trading relations, referred to in Congress as\n``PNTR.'' The president would be required to certify that China is\nhonoring those rights before Congress would grant PNTR, according\nto this proposal.\n\n   He wants China to dismantle its ``reeducation through labor''\ncamps, which force thousands of citizens into camps for up to three\nyears without judicial review. He wants Tibet and Xinjiang, where\nlarge ethnic minority populations are routinely persecuted, to be\nopen to the foreign press and human rights monitors. And he wants\nCongress to pass a code of conduct that would spell out human\nrights principles for U.S. companies in China, such as urging them\nto stop using prison labor and halt political indoctrination\nprograms.\n\n   Jendrzejczyk, 50, an intense, high-energy, 10-year veteran of\nHuman Rights Watch who was formerly with Amnesty International,\nacknowledges there is no quick fix to any of these problems.\n\n   But he says the United States, which carries considerable clout\nas the biggest market for Chinese goods, ``needs to develop a\ncareful strategy that combines carrots and sticks'' to pressure\nChina to stop squashing human rights. He is critical of the Clinton\nadministration, saying President Clinton has ``no real strategy''\non improving human rights in China and ``tends to be driven by\ncrises.''\n\n   Jendrzejczyk says if Congress acts in the next few months, China\nwould have time to make the human rights improvements before China\nis accepted into the World Trade Organization, which is expected at\nthe end of the year.\n\n   ``I think we have a good chance of making human rights prominent\nin the China-WTO debate,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``But whether China\nmakes any real progress on human rights will largely depend on how\nmuch pressure the White House and Congress exert on Beijing.''\n\n   Republican leaders and President Clinton are pushing Congress to\ngrant PNTR to China, which would give the United States greater\naccess to China's markets as part of China's entry into the World\nTrade Organization, the 135-member group that regulates\ninternational trade.\n\n   China is subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 1974 law that\nlimits the trading privileges the United States can grant countries\nthat Congress judges to be suppressing their own people. The law\nallows an annual waiver if Congress and the administration agree\nthat it would substantially promote the law's goals for encouraging\nhuman rights.\n\n   China has been granted a waiver each year since 1980, though\nsome lawmakers have used the yearly vote to voice their disapproval\nof China's human rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its\ntrade surplus with the United States. While U.S. labor leaders\noppose PNTR with China, Jendrzejczyk merely wants to make it\nconditional on improvements in China's human rights record. PNTR is\naccorded to all U.S. trading partners except for a few countries\nthat don't have trade agreements with the United States, such as\nCuba, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Laos, North Korea, Serbia and\nMontenegro.\n\n   Jendrzejczyk said the United States should not isolate China or\ncut them off from trade. ``I don't think that would help,'' he\nsaid. ``We intend to pressure China to become a government that\nfundamentally respects rights.'' He says better trade relations\nwith China can help advance human rights ``only if it is combined\nwith effective sustained pressure on China to respect civil and\npolitical rights.''\n\n   The House, which is expected to vote before the end of May, is\nsharply divided on the issue.\n\n   Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules\nCommittee, and Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., are urging their\ncolleagues to vote for the trade bill.\n\n   ``I believe the most important thing we can do is expand\ntrade,'' Dreier said. ``For the first time we will be prying open a\nmarket with 1.3 billion consumers. That's a winner for U.S. workers\nand businesses.'' Dreier said economic reforms would help bring\nabout change and be ``a winner for a repressive society.''\n\n   Matsui, a longtime free-trader who is rounding up Democratic\nvotes for the China trade bill, warns that loading the legislation\ndown with too many human rights demands could sink it.\n\n   ``We can't have so many things in there that it blows the whole\nthing up,'' Matsui said.\n\n   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., takes a tougher stance than does\nJendrzejczyk.\n\n   Pelosi praises him as ``a very informed and politically astute\nadvocate for human rights'' but criticizes his position for failing\nto include an annual review of China's policies.\n\n   Without that, she says, the United States would lose its\nleverage on human rights or violations of the trade agreement.\n\n   ``They have no credibility when it comes to honoring their\nagreements,'' Pelosi said. ``I don't believe we should give PNTR on\nthe basis of broken promises. They have broken promises on market\naccess, use of prison labor and intellectual property.''\n\n   The Senate, which will follow the House in considering the China\ntrade bill, is likely to approve it.\n\n   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., says a trade bill defeat\n``simply kicks American businesses in the derriere.''\n\n   ``I don't believe human rights is improved by isolating a\ncountry tradewise,'' Feinstein said. ``We're in a global trading\neconomy.''\n\n   Sen. Paul David Wellstone, D-Minn., is in the minority with his\nview that Congress must retain its annual review of China to\nprotect human rights.
