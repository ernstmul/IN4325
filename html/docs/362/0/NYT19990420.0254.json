Unless\nan alarming increase in teenage smoking can be reversed, the\nresearchers said, declining lung cancer rates _ a big part of the\nimproving cancer picture _ will probably start rising again.\n\n   The report was compiled by the American Cancer Society, a\nprivate organization, and three government groups: the National\nCancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nand the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n   ``It is astonishing that almost half of all high school children\nin America currently use some form of tobacco,'' Dr. Howard Koh, a\nmedical oncologist and the public health commissioner for\nMassachusetts, said in the editorial.\n\n   In this century, Koh said in a telephone interview, the tobacco\nindustry was allowed to make a product that drove ``a cancer that\nused to be rare into our leading cancer killer in men and women.''\n\n   There has been a phenomenal 73 percent increase in smoking among\nteenagers between 1988 and 1996, said Barbara Rimer, director of\nthe division of cancer control and population sciences at the\nNational Cancer Institute. ``It's outrageous . . . it's\nhorrifying.''\n\n   ``We need to do something about these high school students;\notherwise we will have another lung-cancer epidemic,'' said Phyllis\nWingo, lead author of the report and director of surveillance\nresearch at the cancer society.\n\n   Nevertheless, the report's accompanying editorial said America\n``has turned the corner'' on cancer.\n\n   Another report in the same issue of the journal reported that\nseven European studies show that smoking cigars, cigarillos, and\npipe tobacco is almost as closely linked to lung cancer as smoking\ncigarettes.\n\n   Because lung cancer accounts for 14 percent of new cancer cases\nand 28 percent of cancer deaths, the biggest impact on cancer can\nbe made by fighting tobacco use, the main report said. About 90\npercent of lung cancer is caused by smoking cigarettes, cigars, and\npipes and by second-hand exposure to smoke.\n\n   The gains made against cancer vary by type of cancer, gender,\nage, race, and ethnicity. Overall, the greatest decline in\nincidence has been among men, who have higher rates of cancer than\nwomen.\n\n   But some cancers _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma _ are not\nshowing improvements. Both the incidence and the death rate from\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma have continued to rise, although the rate of\nincrease appears to have slowed recently, Wingo said in a telephone\ninterview.\n\n   With melanoma, incidence continued to rise almost three percent\na year, while the death rate held steady. Like lung cancer, noted\nKoh, melanoma is a highly preventable cancer. About 70 percent of\ncases are linked to excess sun exposure.\n\n   The new figures show striking disparaties in lung cancer between\nmen and women. The incidence of lung cancer went down an average of\n2.6 percent per year for men, but went up 0.1 percent for women,\nnoted Rimer. And the death rate for lung cancer went down 1.6\npercent for men but went up 1.4 percent for women.\n\n   That's because men started smoking earlier in the century and\nstarted quitting sooner as well. Women are about ``a decade behind\nin stopping,'' Rimer of the NCI said, although researchers are\nstarting to see the numbers improve for younger women (aged 40 to\n59).\n\n   Overall, the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined among\nadults in the last 25 years, but this trend has stalled in the past\nfour to five, the researchers said.\n\n   For colorectal cancer, the news is more gender-balanced.\nIncidence and death rates declined for both men and women. It's too\nsoon to tell whether this is due to increased screening.\n\n   Prostate cancer also declined in incidence and mortality,\nalthough this was not statistically significant, noted Rimer. For\nyears, the incidence had been rising, but much of that rise was\nprobably due to increased screening with a test called PSA. The\npeak incidence was in 1992, the report shows.\n\n   Breast cancer incidence remains unchanged, but death rates have\ndeclined at about 2 percent a year since 1990. Part of that, cancer\nepidemiologists believe, is due to increased use of screening\nmammograms, which about two-thirds of women over 65 now get. Part\nof the improvement in death rates is also probably due to more\nwidespread use of treatments such as chemotherapy.\n\n   But the breast cancer mortality rate continues to show a racial\ndisparity. Black women are somewhat less likely than white women to\nget the disease, but they are more likely to die from it.\n\n   With leukemia, overall mortality is down 0.3 percent, and\nincidence is down 1.1 percent, with no large gender differences.\n``We honestly don't know why there has been a decrease in\nmortality,'' said Rimer.\n\n   ``These findings underscore the remarkable progress we've made\nagainst cancer, but it also reminds us that our battle is far from\nover,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala\nin a statement released Tuesday.\n\n   For children younger than 15 years old, the incidence of cancer\ndeclined 0.4 percent a year between 1990 and 1996 and mortality\ndecline 2.7 percent.\n\n   The greatest decrease in overall incidence of cancer has\noccurred since 1992, the year in which incidence rates peaked.\n\n   The report also analyzed cancer data for whites, blacks,\nAsians/Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives and\nHispanics. There were large differences in incidence by race and\nethnicity, with the highest incidence rates for blacks for all the\nmajor types of cancer except breast cancer.\n\n     \n(For more information on this study, see the Web site\nwww-seer.ims.nci.nih.gov)\n","Headline":"\nREPORT SEES DROP IN DEATH RATE, INCIDENCE FROM CANCER \n","Text":["\n   In a report that suggests that the United States has ``turned\nthe corner'' on cancer, the government says both the death rate and\nincidence of new cancer cases declined significantly for all types\nof the disease between 1990 and 1996.\n","\n   The latest ``cancer report card'' says the rate of new cancers\nhas gone down an average of nearly 1 percent a year over the study\nperiod and that the mortality rate has dropped a little more than\n0.5 percent.\n","\n   The results are published in the current Journal of the National\nCancer Institute, which also included an editorial lauding the\nreport.\n","\n   But the study results also came Tuesday with a warning.
