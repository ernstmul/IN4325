Much of the money will be for\nsatellite technology, and new ships and airplanes to intercept drug\nsmugglers passing through Mexican waters and territory.\n\n   ``We will use the best technology available in the world,'' said\nMexico's Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida. ``This is a total\nwar on narco-trafficking.''\n\n   Labastida appeared at a news conference here to announce the\nplan with Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo, Secretary of\nDefense Enrique Cervantes and Secretary of the Navy Ramon Lorenzo\nFranco.\n\n   By the end of this month, the Clinton Administration must decide\nwhether to recommend that the U.S. Congress ``certify'' Mexico as a\nreliable partner in the international war on drugs.
