(lb) \n By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Neanderthals and modern humans not only coexisted for thousands\nof years long ago, as anthropologists have established, but now\ntheir little secret is out: They also cohabited.\n\n   At least that is the interpretation being made by\npaleontologists who have examined the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a\nyoung boy discovered recently in a shallow grave in Portugal. Bred\nin the boy's bones seemed to be a genetic heritage part\nNeanderthal, part early modern Homo sapiens. He was a hybrid, they\nconcluded, and the first strong physical evidence of interbreeding\nbetween the groups in Europe.\n\n   ``This skeleton demonstrates that early modern humans and\nNeanderthals are not all that different,'' said Dr. Erik Trinkaus,\na paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ``They\nintermixed, interbred and produced offspring.''\n\n   Although some scientists disputed the interpretation, other\nscientists who study human origins said in interviews last week\nthat the findings were intriguing, probably correct and certain to\nprovoke debate and challenges to conventional thinking about the\nplace of Neanderthals in human evolution.\n\n   Neanderthals and modern humans presumably were more alike than\ndifferent, not a separate species or even subspecies, but two\ngroups who viewed each other as appropriate mates.\n\n   Recent DNA research had appeared to show that the two people\nwere unrelated and had not interbred. Neanderthals lived in Europe\nand western Asia from 300,000 years ago until the last of them\ndisappeared on the Iberian peninsula about 28,000 years ago. In the\nprevailing theory today, modern humans arose in Africa less than\n200,000 years ago and appeared in great numbers in Europe, starting\nabout 40,000 years ago.\n\n   The new discovery could, at long last, resolve the question of\nwhat happened to the Neanderthals, the stereotypical stocky,\nheavy-browed ``cave men.'' They may have merged with modern humans,\ncalled Cro-Magnons, who appear to have arrived in Europe with a\nsuperior tool culture. In that case, some Neanderthal genes survive\nin most Europeans and people of European descent.\n\n   The skeleton of the boy, buried with strings of marine shells\nand painted with red ocher, was uncovered in December by Portuguese\narchaeologists led by Dr. Joao Zilhao, director of the Institute of\nArchaeology in Lisbon. The discovery was made in the Lapedo Valley\nnear Leiria, 90 miles north of Lisbon.\n\n   Realizing the potential significance, Zilhao called in Trinkaus,\nan authority on Neanderthal paleontology, who went to Lisbon and\nexamined the bones in January.\n\n   The boy, who was about 4 years old at death, had the prominent\nchin and other facial characteristics of a fully modern human. But\nhis stocky body and short legs were those of a Neanderthal.\nTrinkaus compared the limb proportions with those of Neanderthal\nskeletons, including some children. He said he was then sure of the\nskeleton's implications.\n\n   ``It's a complex mosaic, which is what you get when you have a\nhybrid,'' Trinkaus said. ``This is the first definite evidence of\nadmixture between Neanderthals and European early modern humans.''\n\n   The age of the skeleton, determined by radiocarbon dating,\nshowed that full Neanderthals had apparently been extinct for at\nleast 4,000 years before the boy was born. ``This is no love\nchild,'' Trinkaus said, meaning that this was not evidence of a\nrare mating but a descendant of generations of\nNeanderthal-Cro-Magnon hybrids.\n\n   Trinkaus and Zilhao have completed a more detailed scientific\nreport to be published soon in the Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences. DNA tests on the skeleton have not yet been\ndone.\n\n   Other Neanderthal specialists reacted favorably to the\ndiscovery. Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University in De\nKalb called it ``very convincing and absolutely right.''\n\n   Smith noted that he had come upon other skeletal material in\ncentral Europe that raised the possibility of interbreeding between\nthe groups. Though most scholars in the field will probably accept\nthe possibility of interbreeding, he said, a significant number\nwill probably not.\n\n   The more ardent exponents of the out-of-Africa hypothesis of\nmodern human origins may be holdouts. They have argued that early\nmodern humans all emerged from Africa and wiped out the Neanderthal\npopulation in Europe. Whether the relationship was fraternal or\ngenocidal has been much debated. But many have argued that the two\ngroups were distinct, with humans displacing and probably\nslaughtering their rivals.\n\n   Dr. Chris Stringer, an expert on Neanderthals at the Museum of\nNatural History in London, who is a leader of the out-of-Africa\nforces, said that he was willing to consider the Portuguese\nfindings with an open mind. He told The Associated Press that the\ncurrent evidence was not sufficient to convince him of Trinkaus'\nhybrid interpretation.\n\n   An alternative theory, known as regional continuity, holds that\nthe earliest human ancestors arose in Africa and spread around the\nworld more than a million years ago. Modern humans then emerged in\ndifferent regions through separate evolution and interbreeding. A\nleading advocate of this theory is Dr. Milford Wolpoff, a\npaleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\n   ``This find should be devastating to the out-of-Africa people,''\nWolpoff said. ``It shows their theory doesn't work, at least in\nEurope. And it shows that fundamentally, Neanderthals are the same\nspecies we are and they contributed their genes to European\nancestry.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   By now, scientists said, only a small fraction of Neanderthal\ngenes have survived, the European gene pool having been further\nmixed through migrations during the spread of agriculture and\ninvasions from the east.\n\n   But Wolpoff cautioned that it would take more than one skeleton\nto tell the effects of interbreeding apart from ordinary\nevolutionary changes, the result of genes modifying in response to\nenvironmental stresses.\n\n   Dr. Alan Mann, a specialist in human evolution at the University\nof Pennsylvania, called the Portuguese hybrid skeleton ``some of\nthe most important data we ever got about Neanderthals in human\nevolution,'' but said he was not sure that interbreeding had been\nestablished.\n\n   Trinkaus said the discovery ``refutes strict replacement models\nof modern human origins'' and also seemed to undermine\ninterpretations of recent DNA research. Two years ago, Dr. Svante\nPaabo of the University of Munich in Germany, reported that a study\nof the genetic material DNA from Neanderthal remains and living\nhumans indicated that Neanderthals did not interbreed with the\nmodern humans.\n\n   At the time, scientists said the DNA results reinforced the idea\nthat Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans. If\nthe new findings are correct, though, the two groups were probably\nmore like different races of the same species.\n\n   ``The problem with the DNA research was the interpretation,''\nTrinkaus said. ``It's demonstrably wrong. All that they showed is\nthat Neanderthal biology is outside the range of living humans, not\nmodern Homo sapiens back then.''\n\n   Dr. Alan Templeton, an evolutionary geneticist at Washington\nUniversity, said that some hybridization occurs without the effects\nshowing up, for example, in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed only\nthrough the mother. ``But if you look deep enough in evolutionary\ntime, you find a lot of interbreeding,'' Templeton said. ``That is\nwhat humanity is all about: We interbreed a lot.''\n","Headline":"\nDISCOVERY SUGGESTS HUMANS ARE A BIT NEANDERTHAL \n","Text":["\n   Neanderthals and modern humans not only coexisted for thousands\nof years long ago, as anthropologists have established, but now\ntheir little secret is out: They also cohabited.\n","\n   At least that is the interpretation being made by\npaleontologists who have examined the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a\nyoung boy discovered recently in a shallow grave in Portugal.
