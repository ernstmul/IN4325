(jw) \n By NICHOLAS WADE    \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Saying that he is ``deeply troubled'' by the creation of\npart-human, part-cow embryonic stem cells, President Clinton has\ndirected the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to consider the\nimplications of the research at its meeting Tuesday in Miami and to\nreport back to him ``as soon as possible''.\n\n   In a letter sent Saturday to the chairman of the commission,\nHarold Shapiro of Princeton University, Clinton also asked for a\nreview of embryonic stem-cell research in general, including the\nall-human embryonic stem cells whose isolation was reported earlier\nthis month. These cells _ the primordial, all-purpose cells from\nwhich all tissues of the body develop _ were derived from very\nearly embryos or blastocysts and from tissues of aborted fetuses.\n\n   While the president signaled concern about the ``mingling of\nhuman and non-human species,'' he was more positive about the\nall-human embryonic stem cell research, noting that it ``may have\nreal potential for treating such devastating illnesses as cancer,\nheart disease, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.''\n\n   But he also stressed the ethical concerns raised by the\nresearch, telling the commission that he wanted a ``thorough\nreview, balancing all ethical and medical considerations.''\n\n   The letter was sent after the president had consulted with the\nWhite House Domestic Policy Council and the president's science\nadviser, Neal Lane, ``because he wanted the broadest views possible\n_ the policy people, medical ethicists, as well as the\nscientists,'' an administration official said.\n\n   A political issue that lies in the background of the\ncommission's deliberations is the ban on federal financing of fetal\nresearch. The ban, imposed by Congress, has created the situation\nthat university scientists, who mostly depend on federal money,\ncannot work on the human embryonic stem cells whereas the private\nsector may conduct whatever research it pleases.\n\n   A group of scientists and ethicists known as the Human Embryo\nResearch Panel said in 1994 that research on human embryonic stem\ncells should be federally financed, provided that the cells were\nderived from excess pre-implantation embryos created for\ninfertility treatments. This was the source of some of the human\nembryonic stem cells isolated earlier this month.\n\n   In response to the panel's report, Clinton said in December\n1994, ``I do not believe that federal funds should be used to\nsupport the creation of human embryos for research purposes.'' The\nstatement did not rule out research on excess embryos created in\ninfertility clinics but subsequent action by Congress banned all\nresearch in which a human embryo is destroyed.\n\n   Referring to this history, the president said in his letter\nSaturday that the ethical issues of human embryonic stem cell\nresearch had not diminished since his statement of 1994 but that\nthe benefits had become less hypothetical.\n\n   Lane said the implications of human embryonic stem-cell research\nhad been under review but news of the human-cow hybrid cells,\nreported last week, ``clearly raised urgent ethical, medical and\nlegal issues that the president wants addressed and that's why he\nasked for the commission to give it immediate attention.''\n\n   Human embryonic stem cells can develop into any of the body's\n210 types of cells, a process that happens naturally during fetal\ndevelopment. Biologists at Geron, the company that supported the\nresearch, hope to grow the cells in the laboratory and guide them\nto develop into heart cells, blood cells and other tissues.\n\n   The cells would then be injected into the patient and integrate\nwith tissues under the control of local body signals.\n\n   In principle, the method could address a range of otherwise\nuntreatable degenerative diseases, as well as relieving the severe\nshortage of organs available for conventional transplants.\n\n   Many serious technical problems remain to be resolved, including\nfinding ways to guide the stem cells down desired paths of\ndevelopment and ways to prevent immune rejection.\n\n   The ethical problems are also important because of the source of\nthe embryonic stem cells. In one case the cells came from excess\npre-implantation embryos created in infertility treatments, and in\nthe other from aborted fetal tissue. Both sources were legal, but\nresearch using the first would have been ineligible for federal\nmoney.\n\n   The human-cow hybrid cell also complied with all laws, said\nMichael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology of\nWorcester, Mass., the company that supported the research. In the\nhybrid cell, the cow cell's nucleus is first removed and the cow\nproteins are expected to be rapidly replaced with human proteins as\nthe human nucleus takes over the cell.\n\n   Although the mingling of species raises many questions,\nscientists at Advanced Cell Technology regard the operation as one\nin which the cow egg is used simply to make the human cell's\nnucleus revert to its embryonic state. As the human cells can be\nprovided by the patient himself, from blood or skin, there is no\nimmune rejection when developed cells grown from his embryonic\nstate cells are injected back into the body.\n\n   Advanced Cell Technology performed its cow-human hybrid\nexperiment only once, three years ago, and took the study only to a\nvery preliminary stage. Other scientists say more evidence is\nneeded to verify whether embryonic stem-like cells were created.\n\n   West said he was announcing the research now to test its public\nacceptability before making further investments in the technique.\n","Headline":"\nEFFORT TO MAKE PART-HUMAN, PART-COW CELLS TROUBLES CLINTON\n","Text":["\n   Saying that he is ``deeply troubled'' by the creation of\npart-human, part-cow embryonic stem cells, President Clinton has\ndirected the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to consider the\nimplications of the research at its meeting Tuesday in Miami and to\nreport back to him ``as soon as possible''.\n","\n   In a letter sent Saturday to the chairman of the commission,\nHarold Shapiro of Princeton University, Clinton also asked for a\nreview of embryonic stem-cell research in general, including the\nall-human embryonic stem cells whose isolation was reported earlier\nthis month.
