Times News Service clients)  \n By JERRY KAMMER  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Federal authorities on Friday claimed a major victory in the\nbattle against illegal immigration with the dismantling of a\nPhoenix-based ring that smuggled immigrants into Arizona then sent\nthem on to destinations across the country.\n\n   The officials also announced indictments against 17 people, 10\nof whom have already been arrested.\n\n   According to an official of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService, undercover investi gators infiltrated the ring's\noperations in Honduras, Guatemala and and El Salvador, where local\nbrokers recruited a steady flow of illegals.\n\n   The cost of the trip ranged from $5,000 to $9,000 per person,\nofficials said. Half of the cost was normally paid in advance,\nwhile the remainder was due once the illegals reached Phoenix.\n\n   ``The investigation provided us insight into the detailed\nmechanics of the smuggling trade, which will be invaluable to us in\nthe future,'' said Johnny Williams, western regional director for\nthe INS.\n\n   Steve Fickett, deputy director of the INS Phoenix office that\nconducted the investigation, said its techniques would be taught to\ninvestigators across the country.\n\n   ``We have learned that by following the movement of money, you\ncan get at the corporate structure of these operations and do an\nawful lot of damage to them,'' Fickett said.\n\n   The smuggling ring took in enormous sums of money, officials\nsaid. They said the it often moved 200 Central Americans per week.\n\n   The route typically took them by bus across Mexico to the U.S.\nborder at Douglas, then by vans to Phoenix. Many of the illegals\nwere driven to Los Angeles and then flown to their final\ndestinations.\n\n   Appearing at a news conference with Williams, U.S. Attorney Jose\nde Jesus Rivera said seven of the 10 people arrested so far were\npart of the ring's operations in Phoenix. One of those arrested in\nPhoenix, Ymer Adid Aguilar-Yoc, was identified by officials as a\nleader.\n\n   Others were arrested in Los Angeles and Douglas.\n\n   Once the illegals had reached Phoenix, they were locked in\n``safe houses'' until the smuggling fees were paid in full.\n\n   The indictment charges the alleged ring members not only with\nsmuggling illegal immigrants, but also with holding them hostage\nand laundering the proceeds.\n\n   Officials said the illegals were typically held in the safe\nhouses until relatives wired the final payment to the ring through\na Western Union office in Phoenix.\n\n   Some $200,000 has been seized from the operation, officials\nsaid, along with several vehicles. The investigation is ongoing and\nmore arrests are expected.\n\n   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said immigrant smuggling has\nbecome a multibillion-dollar business.\n\n   ``There's more money in it than ever before, and it has become a\nlot more sophisticated in terms of organization,'' Kice said.\n\n   ``When we use the money laundering laws, that not only helps us\nto get at the profit motive, but the penalties for money laundering\nare stiffer than for some of the more traditional charges related\nto smuggling itself.''  \n","Headline":"\n10 ARRESTED IN PHOENIX-BASED IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING RING \n","Text":["\n   Federal authorities on Friday claimed a major victory in the\nbattle against illegal immigration with the dismantling of a\nPhoenix-based ring that smuggled immigrants into Arizona then sent\nthem on to destinations across the country.\n","\n   The officials also announced indictments against 17 people, 10\nof whom have already been arrested.\n","\n   According to an official of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService, undercover investi gators infiltrated the ring's\noperations in Honduras, Guatemala and and El Salvador, where local\nbrokers recruited a steady flow of illegals.\n","\n   The cost of the trip ranged from $5,000 to $9,000 per person,\nofficials said.
