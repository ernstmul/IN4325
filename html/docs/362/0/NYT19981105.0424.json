Times News Service   \n\n   Pushing the frontiers of biology closer to the central mystery\nof life, scientists have for the first time picked out and\ncultivated the primordial human cells from which an entire\nindividual is created.\n\n   The cells, derived from fertilized human eggs just before they\nwould have implanted in the uterus, have the power to develop into\nmany of the 210 different types of cell in the body _ and probably\nall of them. Because they can divide indefinitely in culture\nwithout the signs of age that afflict other cells, biologists refer\nto them as immortal.\n\n   Eventually, researchers hope to use the cells to grow tissue for\nhuman transplants or to introduce new or improved genes into\npeople.\n\n   But there is a thicket of ethical and legal issues, as well as\ntechnical problems, to be overcome. The cells are obtained from\nembryos created at in vitro fertilization clinics and so far do not\nseem definably different from the primordial cells from which an\nentire individual is created.\n\n   Though some of the scientists involved in the work see nothing\nunusual about working with these cells, other researchers say they\nmust be treated differently, given their human potential. Once the\nwork becomes widely known, it may draw criticism from those who say\nit is wrong to interfere with nature by doing any kind of research\non cells like these.\n\n   Known as human embryonic stem cells, they have eluded capture\nuntil now because they exist in this state only fleetingly before\nturning into more specialized cells, and need special ingredients\nto be kept alive outside the body.\n\n   The new cells have many possible uses of which the most\npromising is to grow new tissue, of any kind, for transplant into a\npatient's body. The cells may also offer effective routes to human\ncloning, although both the researchers and their sponsor deny any\ninterest in this application. Another likely use is in gene\ntherapy, the insertion of new or modified genes into body tissue.\n\n   Two forms of human embryonic cells have been developed, one by a\nteam under Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in\nMadison, the other by Dr. John Gearhart and colleagues at the Johns\nHopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. Thomson's\nwork is reported in this week's issue of Science, and Gearhart's in\nthe Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n   Congress in 1995 banned federal financing of research on fetal\ncells, including those derived from embryos, and the university\nresearchers whose work was announced today were funded by the Geron\nCorporation of Menlo Park, Calif., a biotechnology company that\nspecializes in anti-aging research.\n\n   ``It has potential health benefits which I think are extremely\npromising, and I am sorry that the law prevented us from supporting\nit,'' said Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes\nof Health.\n\n   nn\n\n   After an egg is fertilized it divides several times and forms a\nblastocyst, a hollow sphere with a blob of 15 to 20 cells, known as\nthe inner cell mass, piled up against one wall. It is from these\ncells that the embryo develops. Thomson grew his embryonic stem\ncells from the inner cell mass of blastocysts left over from a\nfertility treatment and due to be discarded. Patients who had\nundergone fertility treatment donated the blastocysts to be used in\nresearch.\n\n   As an embryo grows and develops its cells become irreversibly\ncommitted to their fates as specialized components of the body's\norgans. A pocket of cells, known as embryonic germ cells, is\nprotected from the commitment process so as to create the next\ngeneration of eggs and sperm.\n\n   Gearhart's group has developed embryonic stem cells from the\ngerm cells of aborted fetuses. The cells developed by the two\ngroups may well be equivalent but this has yet to be proved.\n\n   If researchers are able to use the cells to grow new tissues,\nthe work could alleviate the shortage of livers and other organs\nfor transplant. Cultures of the cells in the laboratory could be\nnudged down different developmental pathways to become heart or\nbone marrow or pancreatic cells. Before reaching their final\nstages, the about-to-become heart cells, for example, could be\ninjected into a patient's ailing heart. Guided then by the body's\nown internal regulatory signals, the cells would develop into new,\nyoung heart tissue, supplementing or replacing the heart cells\nalready there.\n\n   The same approach should in principle work with any tissue of\nthe body. Human embryonic stem cells would thus serve as a\nuniversal spare parts system. Because the cells grow and divide\nindefinitely in culture, very few blastocysts would be needed.\n\n   Many technical problems remain to be resolved. The art of\ndirecting embryonic stem cells down specific pathways is in its\ninfancy. But heart muscle cells have been grown from mouse\nembryonic stem cells and successfully integrated with the heart\ntissue of a living mouse. Thomson in 1995 isolated the embryonic\nstem cells of a monkey, and Geron intends to do pilot experiments\nin these cells.\n\n   Another problem lies in making grafted cells compatible with the\npatient's immune system. Dr. Thomas B. Okarma, Geron's vice\npresident for research, said Geron would explore several ways of\ndoing this. One, the least preferred, would be to set up a bank\nwith enough different human embryonic cells that most patients\ncould be matched. Another would be to suppress the self-recognition\ngenes that make the stem cells appear foreign to the patient's\nimmune system or, more elegantly, to replace them with copies of\nthe patient's own self-recognition genes.\n\n   A third approach would be to convert one of the patient's own\nbody cells back to embryonic form by fusing it with a human\nembryonic stem cell whose own nucleus had been removed. Embryonic\ncells may have the power, not yet understood, to rescue an adult\ncell's nucleus from its specialized state by flicking all the\nswitches on its DNA back to default mode. This reprogramming of DNA\nis presumably what happened when mice were cloned this July from\nadult cells.\n\n   The ethical status of the cells is also likely to be a matter of\ndiscussion. They cannot become a fetus, as their blastocyst no\nlonger exists, yet are very similar, if not identical, to the 20 or\nso primordial cells from which the embryo develops.\n\n   Both research groups refer to their cells as ``pluripotent''\nbecause, when injected into a mouse with no immune system the cells\ndevelop into many of the major tissues of the body. The tissues are\ndisorganized and do not develop into a normal embryo.\n\n   The cells may also be ``totipotent,'' meaning they can form\nevery one of the body's cell types, but the experiment to prove\nthis point would be unethical. The test for totipotency, developed\nwith mouse embryonic stem cells, would involve injecting stem cells\ninto another blastocyst. A normal mouse will usually develop but is\ncomposed of a patchwork of cells, some from the blastocyst, some\nfrom the injected embryonic stem cells, proving the stem cells\nretain all their powers.\n\n   nn\n\n   It would be unethical to perform such an experiment on people\nbut if it could be done, it seems likely that the human embryonic\ncells cultured by the researchers would also prove to be\ntotipotent. If so, they might be capable in principle of\ncontributing to the generation of a new individual.\n\n   But ethicists say great care must be taken in work involving\nhuman embryonic cells. ``Any time you take a cell off a blastocyst,\nthat cell could be used itself to create a human being, so some\ngroups in our society believe that in making it transplantable you\nhave derailed it into becoming a kidney or some other tissue,''\nsaid Dr. Lori Andrews of the Chicago-Kent College of Law, an expert\non the laws governing reproductive technology.\n\n   ``Some researchers say `It's just a bunch of cells, why should\npeople care?' But that totally avoids the fact that some people do\ncare, and I'm concerned that if the researchers don't take into\nconsideration the variety of viewpoints about embryos they might\nultimately end up with more restrictive regulations,'' she said.\n\n   Geron, which obtained the exclusive rights to make use of the\ncells from the researchers' universities, which hold patents on the\nprocesses, says it regards them as qualitatively different from\nother cells used in research. ``Because these cells are derived\nfrom human blastocysts there is a moral authority here, so we take\nthese cells seriously,'' said Okarma of Geron.\n\n   He believes that use of the cells is justified because they are\nsomething less than a living embryo and life-saving treatments may\nbe derived from them. ``We are not saying the ends justify the\nmeans, but that given that the moral authority of these cells is\nsubordinate to that of the embryo, the work we contemplate with\nthem is appropriate,'' he said.\n\n   But Gearhart said he did not consider the cells that he and\nThomson have isolated to have a special moral status because ``they\ncannot form a fetus _ you cannot take one of these cells and form a\nbeing out of it.'' Still, he said he would not argue with Okarma's\nview that the cells had a different standing to ordinary cells.\nJohnson, too, said that they were ``special cells.''\n\n   Dr. Kevin T. Fitzgerald, a geneticist and Jesuit priest at\nLoyola University Medical School, said that if the human stem cells\nare totipotent, ``then you are disputing the viability of life, and\nwe are back to the question of how to justify destroying life for\nthe purposes of scientific advancement.''\n\n   The new cells may well reawaken fears of human cloning, although\nmany ethicists have now come around to believing that the public's\nfears, despite science fiction writers' portrayal of clonal armies\nof frenzied despots, are largely beside the point. Many experts now\npredict human cloning is more likely to end up as a rare treatment\noffered in fertility clinics, no different from the others like in\nvitro fertilization and egg donation in that they were first\nbitterly denounced and are now regarded as routine.\n\n   ``Human cloning will likely also be accepted once it becomes a\nreality. Most of today's ethical arguments against it were\npreviously used against in vitro fertilization and turned out to be\nfalse,'' writes Dorothy C. Wertz, a bioethicist at the Shriver\nCenter, in the current issue of Gene Letter.\n\n   The availability of human embryonic stem cells suggests a quite\ndifferent possibility to biologists, who are well aware of how\nmouse embryonic stem cells have long been used to generate\ngenetically altered mice. The belief that humans can now be\nmodified like mice ``will be the knee-jerk reaction of the academic\ncommunity,'' Thomson said.\n\n   He said human embryonic stem cells were unlikely to be used in\nthis way because there were more promising approaches for gene\ntherapy in people. For one thing, the mouse method requires the\ncreation of many embryos in order to obtain the few in which new\ngenes integrate in exactly the correct position, as well as the\nbreeding of a male and female mouse that have been genetically\naltered. In its present form the technique is evidently\ninapplicable to humans.\n\n   nn\n\n   The National Institutes of Health and the university scientists\nit funds often play a leading role in reviewing new biomedical\ntechnologies.\n\n   But because of the Federal funding ban, university scientists\ncannot get government support to study human embryonic stem cells.\nBut industry can do whatever research it pleases, without\nnecessarily obtaining government approval. Academic biologists\nbelieve this asymmetry is unfortunate and that the new technique\nwould receive better and more detached review if the N.I.H and its\nscientists could take part in the discussion.\n\n   Varmus said that an expert panel on human embryo research had\nrecommended to the NIH that attempts to derive stem cells from\nhuman embryos should be permitted, but Federal efforts along this\nline were thwarted in 1995, with the Congressional funding ban.\nVarmus said he believed the public ``will see how important the\nbenefits of this research might be.''\n\n   A Senate bill to ban human cloning was defeated in February, the\nprincipal argument of its opponents being that its overly broad\nlanguage would prohibit promising research on human embryonic stem\ncells.\n\n   In any event, any ultimate use of human embryonic stem cells may\nface legal hurdles in the nine states that have outright bans on\nresearch on human fetal tissues, Andrews said.\n\n   Some laws also prohibit payment for embryos, a restriction that\nmight extend to cell lines and tissues derived from embryos.\n\n   The technique reaches to the central mysteries of life and\ndeath. As biologists have recently begun to understand, the body's\ncells are not inherently mortal. They become mortal only when\ncommitted to developing into one or another of the body's mature\ncell types. These specialized cells have mostly lost the ability to\ngrow and divide but a few, typically those of the skin and\nintestinal lining, can divide in culture about 50 times and then\ndie.\n\n   In January, biologists at Geron learned how to manipulate the\nsection of DNA that marks off the 50 or so permissible divisions.\nBy reversing the changes in this section of DNA, called the\ntelomere, they created lines of cells that divided well beyond the\nusual limit and are still going strong, while retaining their\nyouthful vigor and appearance. Biologists refer to these cultured\ncells as immortal because they are expected to grow and divide\nindefinitely.\n\n   Embyronic stem cells are also immortal because, until they\nbecome committed to specialized fates, their telomeres are renewed\neach time they divide. Unlike ordinary cells, they grow\nindefinitely in culture.\n\n   In the lineage of living organisms, they cycle indefinitely from\nthe embryo to the germ line to a new embryo.\n\n   Geron biologists believe they can manipulate the telomeres of\nthe human embryonic stem cells so that the cells stay immortal even\nas they turn into specialized tissues. Can the mortal body\ntherefore be repaired with new, tissues that remain youthful\nindefinitely? ``Exactly,'' Okarma said.\n\n   Critics have said it would be folly to tamper with the telomere\ndivision-counting system because it probably arose in evolution as\nthe body's last-ditch defense against any run-away cell likely to\nbecome a cancer. Okarma said that new experiments had largely laid\nthis concern to rest by showing that telomerised cells are no more\nlikely to become malignant than are normal cells.\n\n   These grand schemes may or may not come to pass, but the\ntechniques now at hand for manipulating human embryonic stem cells\nwill at least allow them to be seriously attempted.\n","Headline":"\nSCIENTISTS UNLOCK MYSTERY OF THE ELUSIVE STEM CELL\n","Text":["\n   Pushing the frontiers of biology closer to the central mystery\nof life, scientists have for the first time picked out and\ncultivated the primordial human cells from which an entire\nindividual is created.\n","\n   The cells, derived from fertilized human eggs just before they\nwould have implanted in the uterus, have the power to develop into\nmany of the 210 different types of cell in the body _ and probably\nall of them.
