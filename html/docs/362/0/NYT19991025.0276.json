Titled ``Pupil: Pose 1,''\nit's a photo-portrait by Katherine Wetzel and Elizabeth King of\nwhat appears to be a cyborg or mannequin in thoughtful repose.\n\n   Patently artificial yet indisputably lifelike, everything about\nthis creature's face _ the pensive mouth, the averted eyes, the\nslender prosthetic hand cradling the chin _ suggests the spark of\nhuman consciousness. If this androgynous replicant could talk, you\nsuspect it might say: ``I look as though I feel _ therefore, I\nam.''\n\n   Is this the face of virtual emotion, merely, or the real thing?\nWhat makes this cyborg's sensitive countenance any less expressive\nof a unique identity than the flickers of anger, love, pity and\nterror that regularly transform our own features?\n\n   Those are a few of the complex themes raised by ``Pupil: Pose\n1,'' one of approximately 175 works in the exhibition ``Ghost in\nthe Shell'' _ Photography and the Human Soul, 1850-2000, which\nopens today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\n   Organized by photography curator Robert A. Sobieszek, this\nmultimedia show of prints, books and videos, based on 30 years of\nresearch, examines the history of photographic representations of\nhuman identity, personality, character or selfhood _ call it what\nyou will.\n\n   Since at least the time of Aristotle _ who supposedly advised\nAlexander the Great to pick his commanders according to their\nfacial characteristics _ Western culture has construed the face as\nthe locus of human identity. While modern and postmodern art has\nsubdivided and compartmentalized the human body, and the Internet\nhas splintered it into pixels, the face has remained pre-eminent.\n\n   Yet the premise behind LACMA's exhibition derives from\ncenturies-old notions of human individuality which _ thanks to\nrecent advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and the\nconstruction of technology-based ``virtual identities'' _ are\nincreasingly up for grabs.\n\n   While by no means exclusive to Western art, facial\nrepresentation has long been a key element of Western culture: from\nbusts of Roman senators to daguerrotypes of 19th-century writers,\nPicasso's cubist ``anti-portraits'' and Andy Warhol's\ndeer-in-the-headlights Polaroids of Hollywood stars.\n\n   Although ``face-reading'' existed in ancient Asian cultures,\nfacial qualities were generally used to indicate nobility and\nsocial standing rather than to signify individual uniqueness,\naccording to Sobieszek.\n\n   ``To read subjectivity and character, especially moral character\n(in a face), is pretty much a Western thing,'' he says.\n\n   Of course, photographers weren't the first to propose that the\nface could serve as a medium for documenting emotion. Greek and\nRoman artists, followed by Renaissance painters and sculptors,\ndeveloped the idea that the face was a mirror of the soul, an\nexternal manifestation of the inner man or woman.\n\n   Yet by the late 1830s, when photography was born, the\n``science'' or pseudoscience of face-reading had attained a\ncultlike status, Sobieszek writes in the exhibition catalog. In\nEurope, scientists, physicians and philosophers had codified the\nidea that human subjectivity could be read from facial features\n(physiognomy), the shape of the skull (phrenology), or the\nexpression of the emotions (pathognomy).\n\n   Enter a Paris neurophysician named G.-B. Duchenne de Boulogne,\nwho believed that by applying electroshock probes to specific\nmuscles of the human face _ then photographing the results _ it was\npossible to scientifically evoke and document the full range of\nhuman emotional expression.\n\n   When Duchenne published his experiments in 1862 in ``Mecanisme\nde la physionomie humaine,'' along with a set of photographic\nplates, his motives were as much artistic as scientific. Duchenne\nhoped painters would use his book as a guide to depicting\nanatomically correct facial expressions.\n\n   ``For Duchenne, it was very much a wish to have painters do as\nbeautiful portraits as they (could) but still without lying about\nhow the muscles really act,'' Sobieszek says.\n\n   As 19th-century theories of art, medicine and social science\nconverged, photos were taken of manic-depressives, tuberculosis\npatients, criminals, Jews, subjected colonial peoples and\nimmigrants newly arrived in the United States and Western Europe.\nDoctors, police departments, advocates of racist ``eugenics''\ntheories and others attempted to use photography to document common\nfacial features from which archetypes could be constructed.\n\n   ``They developed theories by observation: Look at enough\ncriminals, and if they all have a characteristic that's common,\nthat's a criminal characteristic,'' Sobieszek explains. ``Thereby\nyou can take that characteristic and apply it to somebody else and\nsay, `You must be, if not a criminal, you have the propensity to be\na criminal.' ''\n\n   ``Ghost in the Shell'' demonstrates that the use of photography\nto certify ``acceptable'' (BEGIN ITAL)or ``unacceptable''(END ITAL)\nforms of humanity was brutally alive and well as recently as the\n1970s, when the Khmer Rouge made photo-portraits of its prisoners\nbefore sending them off to the killing fields.\n\n   By the end of the 19th century, however, physiognomy had been\nlargely discredited, along with the belief in photography as an\nobjective record of subjective emotions.\n\n   In its place arose the modernist conviction that art wasn't\nprimarily about the subject; it was about projecting onto the\nsubject whatever personal obsessions or aesthetic concerns the\nartist (and by implication, the viewer) wanted to project.\n\n   Simultaneously, new artistic models of human psychology argued\nthat reality could be invented in our minds, that the human eye\nprojects out as much as it takes in.\n\n   The resulting new conception of photographic portraiture\npersisted well into the 1960s and, in many ways, is still with us,\nSobieszek says.\n\n   ``You see a beautiful portrait of Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate\nMoss, you project your notion of beauty or handsomeness or\nsexuality. I call it the reversal of subjectivity. If I'm Duchenne,\nI'm trying to find out what's inside of you. If I'm August Sander,\nI'm taking a picture from my point of view to do what I want to do.\nIf I'm Edward Weston or (Laszlo) Moholy-Nagy, I'm trying to express\nthe lighting composition, or whatever I want to express.''\n\n   The difference between these two phases of art photography can\nbe seen in a comparison of two exhibition works: Alexander Hesler's\n1860 print of Abraham Lincoln and Andy Warhol's 1964\n``Self-Portrait.''\n\n   In Hesler's work, we're meant to infer from Lincoln's meditative\neyes and heavy brow _ etched in concern over weighty national\nmatters, no doubt _ that this is a man of character. Even the\nphoto's somber sepia palette speaks of Lincoln's presumed moral\nsubstance.\n\n   By contrast, Warhol's strip of four pasty-faced mug shots,\nsnapped in an automated photo booth, delights in obscuring its\nnominal subject. Warhol's social status, occupation, and age _ let\nalone what's on his mind _ are murky. He could be famous (or at\nleast notorious), or he could be a nobody. The image refuses to\nsay. Only the picture's teasing surface matters, not the feelings\nof the virtually anonymous human being underneath.\n\n   The exhibition's third phase deals with the beginnings of\npostmodern photo-portraiture in the late 1970s. Sobieszek decided\nthe key figure in this section would be Cindy Sherman, the popular\nU.S. artist who has spent virtually her entire career photographing\nherself made up as various fictional personae.\n\n   Sobieszek contends that with Sherman's quixotic,\nself-dramatizing images, photographic portraiture has come full\ncircle with Duchenne's ``experimental visual theater'' of\nelectroshock volunteers.\n\n   ``Cindy Sherman, I think, epitomizes the dissociation and the\nmultiplicities that postmodernist artists are dealing with,'' he\nsays. ``I think that whole idea of dissimulating, storytelling,\nnarrative fictions and willing complicity between the artist and\nthe viewer goes back to almost the very beginnings.''\n\n   When Sobieszek first came across Duchenne's images more than 30\nyears ago, he was reminded of old Hollywood ``Frankenstein''\nmovies. Yet the cliche of a mad scientist using machines to\nstimulate human consciousness no longer seems like pure science\nfiction.\n\n   The exhibition's title comes from Masamune Shirow's futuristic\nnovel, ``Ghost in the Shell,'' in which a cyborg wonders whether\nits own personality is real or artificial. Today, some scientists\nassert, it's only a matter of time before the ineffable human soul\ncan be downloaded onto computer software _ putting the ghost into\nthe machine, as it were.\n\n   A scary and anti-humanist possibility?\n\n   ``It is absolutely anti-humanist _ in the classical sense of the\nword,'' Sobieszek agrees. ``And I think we might have to\nre-evaluate or rethink how we define humanism. Because how many\nprostheses or synthetics do we put in ourselves? And how much\nemotion and intelligence do we put into machines before there is no\ndifference?''\n\n     \n___   \n   \n      \nWhat:    ``Ghost in the Shell'' _ Photography and the Human Soul,\n1850-2000.      \nWhere:    Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd.      \nWhen:    Through Jan. 16.
