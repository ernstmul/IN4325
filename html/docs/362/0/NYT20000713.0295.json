The money would\nbe distributed as federal grants to community programs.\n\n   The Pennsylvania Democratic Party used the visit as an\nopportunity to renew questions about whether Bush received\nfavorable treatment when he was on temporary duty with the Alabama\nAir National Guard in 1972 and 1973 while working on a U.S. Senate\ncampaign. There is no record of Bush actually pulling duty while in\nthe Alabama guard on a transfer from his Texas guard unit.\n\n   Bush defended his service, saying the proof is in the fact that\nhe was discharged honorably after serving as an F-102 pilot in\nTexas.
