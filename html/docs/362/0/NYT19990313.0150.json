They find a dozen Cuban\npassengers aboard. The boat's captain explains that he happened to\nbe fishing when he spotted the Cubans struggling in a sinking raft.\nThough the passengers show no signs of fatigue, dehydration or\ninjury, they confirm the story and insist that the captain be\ntreated as a hero.\n\n   Alien smuggling cases are difficult to prosecute because often\nthe only witness to the crime is the smuggled human cargo. And\npeople who spend their life savings in a desperate bid to get into\nthe United States make reluctant witnesses, prosecutors say.\n\n   The problem of building a case becomes particularly acute when\nit involves Cubans, said one Justice Department source who traded\nhis candid remarks for anonymity.\n\n   ``When you're dealing with a Cuban boat captain and Cuban\npassengers, invariably, everyone denies that smuggling is taking\nplace,'' he said. ``It's always a rescue at sea.''\n\n   The business of immigrant smuggling prospers. Demand is high.\nCuban, Haitian and other economic and political refugees eagerly\nhire entrepreneurs with fast boats capable of dodging Coast Guard\npatrols. The risks of capture and punishment are low. The Border\nPatrol in Florida hasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years.\nConvicted smugglers seldom spend much time in prison.\n\n   Built-in deniability is one reason South Florida's federal\nprosecutors historically have been reluctant to drag suspected\nsmugglers into court. They filed only 101 cases of smuggling or\nharboring illegal aliens during a five-year period ending September\n1998, according to Justice Department records. They declined to\nprosecute another 47 cases referred to them by immigration and\nother law enforcement officials during that period.\n\n   U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, who assumed office in mid-1997,\ndeclined to discuss the past performance of federal prosecutors in\nSouth Florida. His policy is to aggressively prosecute smugglers,\nhe said.\n\n   His prosecutors filed 21 alien smuggling cases in the past six\nmonths.\n\n   Fifteen prosecutors are available for smuggling cases, said John\nSchlesinger, Scott's special counsel. The office also acquired\nthree attorneys on loan from the Immigration and Naturalization\nService to help deal with immigration cases. At this point,\nhowever, there are no plans to create a special smuggling unit as\nthere are for drugs and white collar crimes.\n\n   Kathleen Williams, the federal public defender in Miami, said\nshe hasn't noticed a sharp increase in smuggling cases.\n\n   ``There certainly has been an appreciable increase in the number\nof press conferences on the subject,'' she said. ``It could be\nthey're being more aggressive or it could be they're making a lot\nof noise about it.''\n\n   Williams suggested to Scott that federal prosecutors and public\ndefenders work together to expedite smuggling cases.\n\n   ``I was rebuffed,'' she said. ``I was told they didn't have\nenough cases to warrant that.''\n\n   Historically, smugglers faced little or no prison time if\ncaught. Prosecutors suffered a frustrating irony: on average, they\nspent more time preparing a case _ roughly six months _ than the\nsmuggler spent in prison.\n\n   Furthermore, punishment was light even when smuggled people\ndied. For example, last year three Cubans drowned during a\nsmuggling trip. Two brothers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to\nfewer than four years in prison. In 1994, four Haitians, two adults\nand two children, drowned off Jensen Beach in a smuggling attempt.\nThe boat's captain was sentenced to fewer than four years.\n\n   ``Quite frankly, the penalty for getting caught smuggling aliens\nis just not the same as for someone caught carrying a load of\ndrugs,'' said Mark Briesemeister, who supervises an anti-smuggling\nunit for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami. ``To\nthe smuggler, the risks are minimal and the profit potential is\nhigh.''\n\n   Congress upped the stakes two years ago when it toughened the\npenalties for the crime. The maximum penalty for alien smuggling\ndoubled to 10 years. Federal judges must sentence smugglers to a\nminimum of three years now if prosecutors prove the crime was\ncommitted for profit. And prosecutors can now seek the death\npenalty for smugglers who cause deaths.\n\n   Cuban smugglers have operated with near impunity. For years,\nfederal prosecutors hesitated to take smuggling cases to trial in\nMiami, where juries could easily include exiles and immigrants.\n\n   The Palm Beach Post examined the cases of 21 defendants who\npleaded guilty to smuggling aliens and four who were convicted\nduring 1996 and 1997. None involved Cubans.\n\n   That's beginning to change. In 1998 South Florida prosecutors\nfiled alien smuggling charges in six incidents involving Cubans.\nNine Cubans were charged.\n\n   Immigrants drowned in two of those episodes. In the most\ndramatic, a boat packed with 23 Cubans capsized on Dec. 17 south of\nMiami. Officials believe 14 people drowned.\n\n   Such tragedies are altering South Florida's attitudes toward\nsmugglers, the U.S. attorney said. The Cuban community now supports\na crackdown, he said.\n\n   ``I think they recognize that many of these cases are strictly\nabout money and may involve death,'' Scott said.\n\n   Federal prosecutors secure guilty pleas or verdicts in more than\n80 percent of the smuggling cases in South Florida, according to\nJustice Department records. Prosecutors in the Southwest boast the\nsame success rate.\n\n   However, South Florida prosecutors historically have dropped the\ncharges in smuggling cases more often than their colleagues in the\nSouthwest _ and prosecutors there handle far more cases.\n\n   South Florida prosecutors declined 48.8 percent of the smuggling\ncases referred to them by law enforcement during a five-year period\nending Sept. 30, 1997. Prosecutors in Arizona declined 6.4 percent\nduring that period. Prosecutors in South Texas and Southern\nCalifornia dropped only 3 percent.\n\n   Regional comparisons are misleading, cautions Assistant U.S.\nAttorney John Schlesinger.\n\n   ``There's no plausible deniability in the Southwest,'' he said.\n``For example, if the Border Patrol stops a car crossing the\nMexican border and finds a few aliens in the trunk, what can the\ndriver say?''\n\n   Weak evidence prompted prosecutors in South Florida to drop 16\nsmuggling cases during the five-year period examined by The Post.\nThey declined to prosecute 18 others because of a ``lack of\ninvestigative or prosecutorial resources,'' according to Justice\nDepartment records.\n\n   It's tough to prosecute cases that rely on the testimony of\nsmuggled migrants.\n\n   Investigators often must decide at sea whether to hold smuggled\naliens as witnesses or send them back to their homeland.\nRepatriation usually means forfeiting their testimony, though\nprosecutors have in rare instances taken depositions on foreign\nsoil. However, that approach raises a Sixth Amendment issue of the\naccused smuggler's right to confront all witnesses.\n\n   A boatload of Cubans interdicted at sea might be eager to be\nbrought to shore to testify in a smuggling case. Once in the\ncountry, the Cuban Refugee Readjustment Act kicks in, allowing them\nto remain in the country and become eligible for citizenship after\nfive years. In effect, prosecutors who bring witnesses ashore are\nfinishing the smuggler's job.\n\n   ``Bringing Cuban aliens into Miami to be witnesses is shooting\nthe anti-smuggling effort in the foot,'' said a Justice Department\nsource.\n\n   Also, defense attorneys are quick to attack the credibility of\nmigrant witnesses. They trade their testimony for promises of work\npermits and citizenship, attorneys argue.\n\n   Often, smuggled individuals refuse to become witnesses. Two\nBahamian men suspected of smuggling 15 Haitians into Broward County\nwere deported to Freeport in January after Border Patrol agents\nfailed to persuade any of the refugees to testify.\n\n   ``I'd say that 80 percent of people don't want to cooperate,''\nsaid Steve Quinones, head of the Border Patrol's anti-smuggling\nunit in Miami.\n\n   Without believeable witnesses, prosecutors usually must rely on\ncircumstantial evidence. They cite the cash, cell phone numbers and\nthe boat's high-tech navigational gear that pinpoints the migrants'\ndestination.\n\n   Most smuggling convictions are open-and-shut cases: a rental van\npacked with Mexicans stopped on Interstate 95, Ecuadorans arriving\nat Miami International Airport with fake passports, Dominicans\nstowed away in a cruise ship cabin.\n\n   Prosecutors convicted 61 people of smuggling or harboring aliens\nduring the five-year period ending in September 1997. Most were\nguilty pleas.\n\n   But most of those smugglers didn't go to prison. About one in\nfour was sentenced to prison during that period.\n\n   Courts in the Southwest seem tougher. Judges in Arizona\nsentenced 30.5 percent to prison. Southern California judges sent\n45 percent to prison and South Texas judges imprisoned slightly\nmore than half.\n\n   Those who were sentenced to prison haven't done much time. The\nmedian prison term in 1997, what the majority of smugglers\nconvicted in South Florida faced, was five months.\n\n   Prosecutors have managed to send smugglers away for longer\nprison terms by charging them with other crimes. For example, if a\ndeported smuggler comes back to the United States, just walking the\nstreets is evidence of a new crime: re-entering the country.\n\n   The charge, dubbed ``felony walking,'' is virtually\nindefensible.\n\n   Gary Kane is a staff writer for The Palm Beach Post.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a crime with built-in deniablity.\n","\n   This is how it plays out: A U.S. Coast Guard patrol stops a\nhigh-speed boat off the Florida Keys.
