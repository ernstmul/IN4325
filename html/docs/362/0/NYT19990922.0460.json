Times News Service    \n\n   A new calculation of the number of human genes puts the total\nfar higher than previous estimates, meaning that the human organism\nis considerably more complex than hitherto expected.\n\n   The new estimate, by Incyte Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto,\nCalif., sets the number of human genes at 140,000. Each gene\nspecifies the manufacture of one or more proteins, the working\nparts of the body. As the programming instructions of the human\ncell, the genes provide all the information needed to develop,\noperate and maintain the human organism.\n\n   The new figure was announced on Monday night by Dr. Randy Scott,\npresident and chief scientific officer of Incyte, at a conference\nin Miami held by the Institute for Genomic Research.\n\n   The number is a sharp upward revision and one that points up how\nmuch there is still to learn about human genetic programming.\n\n   The C. elegans roundworm was thought to have about 12,000 genes\nuntil shortly before its genome was sequenced last year, when it\nturned out to have 19,099 genes. So humans are receiving the same\nkind of upgrade in complexity as the worm.\n\n   Scott's company provides genetic information to pharmaceutical\ncompanies, as does its rival, the Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md.,\nheaded by Dr. J. Craig Venter. Scott's estimate for the total\nnumber of humans genes is double that calculated by Venter five\nyears ago. At that time, Venter predicted 60,000 to 80,000 human\ngenes.\n\n   Many biologists use the figure of 100,000 human genes, a round\nnumber that implies the exact total could be somewhat more or less.\nThe Web page of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the\nfederal agency that provides money for the major part of the human\ngenome project, estimates that there are 50,000 to 100,000 human\ngenes.\n\n   Genes are small, selected sequences of DNA strung out along the\nenormous DNA molecules that form the chromosomes. One reason for\nthe wide uncertainty over the number of human genes is that there\nis no sure way of telling where on a sequence of DNA a gene starts.\n\n   In making its new estimate, Incyte scientists depended on that\nfact that while biologists cannot recognize where the genes lie on\nDNA, human cells can. The cell's machinery transcribes genes into\nactive copies known as messenger RNA. These cellular messages can\nbe captured and analyzed before they are naturally degraded.\n\n   By decoding the heads and tails of as many messages as they\ncould find, Incyte biologists figured that the total number of\ndifferent genes in the full human DNA, or genome, was 130,000.\nUsing an independent method, based on a feature known as CG islands\nthat occur in about half of known genes, Incyte calculated 143,000\ngenes in every cell of the human body. Putting the two estimates\ntogether produced the figure of 140,000.\n\n   Venter said that no region of the human genome that had been\ndecoded so far contained as many genes as the Incyte estimate\nimplied. His earlier estimate of 70,000 human genes, he said,\nassumes that human cells have three billion units of DNA. If the\nhuman genome is 25 percent larger than this, as Celera's recent\nwork on the fruit fly genome suggests may be the case, Venter said\nhe would raise his estimate of the number of human gene by 25\npercent.\n\n   A publicly financed consortium of university centers has said it\nwill issue a 90 percent complete draft of the human genome by next\nspring.\n","Headline":"\nNUMBER OF HUMAN GENES IS PUT AT 140,000, A SIGNIFICANT GAIN \n","Text":["\n   A new calculation of the number of human genes puts the total\nfar higher than previous estimates, meaning that the human organism\nis considerably more complex than hitherto expected.\n","\n   The new estimate, by Incyte Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto,\nCalif., sets the number of human genes at 140,000.
