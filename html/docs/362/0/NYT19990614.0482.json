Times News Service   \n\n   The Geron Corp., which has sponsored the leading research on\nprimordial human cells, said Monday that it was conducting research\non discarded human embryos in the hope of learning how to convert\nthe ordinary cells of a patient into stem cells that can be used\nfor self-repair.\n\n   The company denied a report Monday that it was trying to create\ncloned human embryos and said that it had no intention of doing so.\nRather, its recently announced collaboration with the Roslin\nInstitute of Scotland, the cloner of Dolly the sheep, was an effort\nto understand how eggs ``reprogram'' the nucleus of an adult cell,\nsaid Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice-president for research.\n\n   If the reprogramming process was understood, biologists might be\nable to take an ordinary cell from a patient and convert it into a\nstem cell, using the reprogramming factors found in an egg. A group\nof the stem cells might then be used to repair the patient's\ntissues.\n\n   Okarma said Geron was working with animal eggs and with human\neggs rejected by fertility clinics because they were not viable.\nThe company's biologists said they hoped to see what factors from\nthe fluid, or cytoplasm, of the egg bind to its nucleus, in the\nhope that these factors would show how the nucleus was\nreprogrammed. An article on the company's research appeared in The\nWashington Post on Monday.\n\n   Geron, a biopharmaceutical company in Menlo Park, Calif.,\nfinanced the research of two university scientists who isolated\nhuman embryonic stem cells last year for the first time. Congress\nhas forbidden the use of federal funds for such purposes.\n\n   Geron, a company whose goal is to combat aging, worked to\nisolate human embryonic stem cells because the cells have the\npotential of turning into liver cells, eye cells, neurons _ all of\nthe body's cell types. Stem cells, can in principle, be used to\nrepair all of these tissues.\n\n   But Geron's human embryonic stem cells are likely to be rejected\nby most patients because they belong to an individual with an\nincompatible immune system. Though there are theoretical ways to\nfix the problem, the company has decided to take a leaf from the\nanimal cloners' book.\n\n   In animal cloning, the nucleus of an adult cell from one sheep,\nsay, is inserted into a second sheep's egg cell, whose own nucleus\nhas been removed. Adult cells typically have their genes\npermanently switched off, save those needed for specific roles.\nUnknown factors in the cytoplasm of the recipient egg can\napparently release the switched-off genes in the adult cell's\nnucleus, reprogramming it so it can take over the egg cell,\ncreating an embryo that grows into a twin of the animal that\nprovided the nucleus.\n\n   Geron said it was not interested in cloning animals or people\nbut in discovering the reprogramming factors and applying them to\nmature cells from a patient, to avoid rejection by the patient's\nimmune system and any ethical problems of using cells from a\ndiscarded human embryo.\n\n   At no stage of the process, as it has been described, would a\nhuman embryo be created. Though human embryonic stem cells can\ngenerate all the tissues of the body, the tissues are not formed in\nan orderly fashion unless the cells are inside the hollow sphere of\nan early human embryo. The cells that form the sphere, known as\ntrophoblasts, seem to be responsible for organizing the inner cell\nmass, from which embryonic stem cells are derived, into a properly\nformed embryo.\n\n   Embryos are created, however, in the process being pursued at\nAdvanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Mass., which announced last\nNovember that it had transferred nuclei from human cells into cow\neggs. The human nuclei are thought to take over the cow egg, so\nthat the hybrid embryo quickly becomes human during the few days it\nlives.\n\n   The company's experiment was performed several years ago and\nthen halted. But Dr. Robert Lonza, an official at ACT, said Monday\nthe experiments had been resumed recently with two goals in mind.\nOne, like Geron's, is to discover factors that enable the egg to\nreprogram the nucleus. The other is to create embryonic stem cells\nfrom a patient by inserting a nucleus from the patient's cells into\na cow egg and then take the stem cells from the hybrid embryo,\nwhich would be discarded.\n\n   Other scientists are skeptical of this approach because of\nevidence that mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in the\ncytoplasm of the cow egg, would not work well with a human nucleus.\n\n   Lonza said that recently, Dr. Neil First of the University of\nWisconsin formed hybrid embryos using denucleated cow eggs and\nnuclei from mice, monkeys and other animals. The embryos did not\ngrow to term in a cow's uterus, suggesting, he said, that cow-human\nhybrid embryos would not be viable. Lonza said the company was\nconsidering ways to replace the cow mitochondria with human\nmitochondria.\n","Headline":"\nHUMAN EMBRYOS USED, BUT NOT CLONED, IN GERON'S RESEARCH\n","Text":["\n   The Geron Corp., which has sponsored the leading research on\nprimordial human cells, said Monday that it was conducting research\non discarded human embryos in the hope of learning how to convert\nthe ordinary cells of a patient into stem cells that can be used\nfor self-repair.\n","\n   The company denied a report Monday that it was trying to create\ncloned human embryos and said that it had no intention of doing so.\nRather, its recently announced collaboration with the Roslin\nInstitute of Scotland, the cloner of Dolly the sheep, was an effort\nto understand how eggs ``reprogram'' the nucleus of an adult cell,\nsaid Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice-president for research.\n","\n   If the reprogramming process was understood, biologists might be\nable to take an ordinary cell from a patient and convert it into a\nstem cell, using the reprogramming factors found in an egg.
