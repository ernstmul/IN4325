These cells, which appear early in an embryo's\ndevelopment, can grow to become anything in the body, including\nheart, kidney, blood and bone marrow cells that could be\ntransplanted into people whose own organs are not functioning\nproperly.\n\n   But an embryo is destroyed in the process of harvesting its stem\ncells, raising thorny questions about whether it is proper to end\none form of human life to benefit another.\n\n   The debate is being prodded by the National Institutes of\nHealth, which this month laid out guidelines for funding stem cell\nresearch that would use embryos produced by couples during\ninfertility treatments but not used. The NIH says its plan is\nlegal, but some lawmakers said it violates a congressional ban on\nspending federal money for research that destroys embryos.\n\n   House members who support the ban will likely challenge the NIH\nearly next year. ``Something is going to be done one way or\nanother, in the courts or in Congress,'' said Representative Jay\nDickey, an Arkansas Republican.\n\n   Senate supporters of the stem cell research said Majority Leader\nTrent Lott has promised a debate on whether to give the NIH\nexplicit authority to proceed. The NIH is taking public comments on\nits proposal through Jan. 31.\n\n   ``To what extent can we profit from things that some people\nthink are morally questionable?'' asked Ronald M. Green, professor\nof ethics at Dartmouth College. ``How do we determine where life\nbegins? I think stem cell research raises some of the most\nimportant moral questions of our time.''\n\n   Stem cells develop when embryos are only a few days old and have\nonly 15 or 20 cells. Some of those cells are destined to form the\nheart, others to form bones or blood. But they have not yet\n``committed'' to any part of the body, and they have the ability to\nbecome part of almost any organ system.\n\n   Using private funds, scientists from the University of Wisconsin\nin Madison last year were able to grow embryonic stem cells for the\nfirst time.\n\n   The researchers obtained the cells from embryos that couples had\ncreated during fertility treatments and that were going to be\ndiscarded. Couples routinely make more embryos than they use in\ntrying to produce a child, leaving thousands of frozen embryos\naround the country that the potential parents may use later,\ndestroy or preserve indefinitely.\n\n   The number of frozen embryos in the United States is estimated\nat 150,000, though no one knows for sure. While more are created\neach year, their legal and moral status remains unclear.\n\n   Under Roe v. Wade, life in the womb has no legal status that\noutweighs a woman's right to end her pregnancy, though in the third\ntrimester states may protect a fetus by restricting abortion. Now,\nthe nation must consider whether early human life has value that\noutweighs a scientist's research proposal or a patient's desire for\nnew cures.\n\n   Many patient-advocate groups say the potential benefit to\nmillions of people makes the research essential. But for\nChristopher Currie, 37, whose diabetes is damaging his eyesight,\nkidneys and nervous system, embryonic stem cell research crosses a\nclear moral line.\n\n   ``I could not carry the burden of adding years to my life at the\ncost of causing someone else to perish,'' said Currie, a Catholic\nand college philosophy major, who also opposes abortion. ``It\nscares me to think I could be faced with the decision'' to accept a\nstem cell treatment. ``I would look at my wife and daughter, and it\nwould rip my guts apart.''\n\n   However, opinions on abortion are proving to be only a limited\nguide in the stem cell debate. In a little noted development,\nopponents of the research have grown to include some people outside\nthe antiabortion camp. They argue that a woman should have the\nright to end her own pregnancy, but also that human embryos have\nenough innate value that they should not be used as experimental\nmaterial.\n\n   That is the position of the United Methodist Church, which has\n8.5 million members. ``We are not saying that an embryo is the same\nthing as human life, but we are saying that it deserves special\nconsideration,'' said Jaydee Hanson, of the church's Board of\nChurch and Society.\n\n   Some scientists hold the same view. ``To acknowledge the right\nof somebody not to be a parent is not the same as saying we can do\nanything we want with human embryos,'' said Stuart Newman, a\ndevelopmental biologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla,\nN.Y.\n\n   Newman concedes the stem cell debate could prompt some people to\nrevise their view of abortion. ``A mother's right not to proceed\nwith a pregnancy is not so much based on biology as on a social\ncontract,'' he said. ``But to draw attention to the basic humanity,\nthe biological humanity, of her pregnancy kind of corrupts the\nwhole contract and shows it to be something that is purely\npractical.''\n\n   While the nature of the research forces the NIH to confront\ntough ethical questions, the agency's political situation makes the\nlandscape even trickier.\n\n   In 1995, Congress approved language that barred federal funding\nfor any ``research in which a human embryo or embryos are\ndestroyed.'' The law does not prohibit privately funded research,\nthough some states regulate or bar it.\n\n   The NIH, after obtaining a legal opinion early this year from\nthe Department of Health and Human Services, said that it had the\nauthority to fund stem cell research, as long as taxpayer money did\nnot pay for the process of extracting the cells from embryos.\n\n   Now, even some supporters of the agency said that reasoning is\nstrained. If a lab somewhere destroys embryos on behalf of a stem\ncell researcher, they said, that researcher cannot claim to have\nhad no role in the destruction.\n\n   Green, the Dartmouth ethicist, said this was similar to the\nunresolved question facing scientists today of whether to use\nresearch conducted on Nazi death camp inmates.\n\n   ``This touches on one of the most fascinating moral question of\nour century: At what point does cooperating with moral wrongdoing\nbegin?'' he said.\n\n   Raising another question, the new NIH guidelines say that\nresearchers may use only stem cells taken from embryos created\nduring infertility treatments. Scientists may not create new human\nembryos in order to produce stem cells.\n\n   But NIH critics say an embryo either has moral value or it does\nnot, independent of why it was created.\n\n   ``If it's not human life, why is it a bad thing to create it?''\nasked Maggie Wynne, staff member of the House Prolife Caucus, which\nopposes the research. Rather than using rigid logic, she said, the\nNIH ``is gauging things on the `yuck factor,' on what the general\npublic will accept before they get the idea that the NIH is out of\ncontrol and starting to play around with human life.''\n\n   More questions arise from the fact that scientists are learning\nnew ways to produce tissues and whole organisms from a single cell.\nCanadian scientsts in 1993 reported producing entire mice from stem\ncells, and it could be possible to produce a person from a single\nhuman cell. For some people, this feat raises the question of\nwhether a single cell carries the same moral value as a person,\neven though it would need extraordinary care to complete its\ngrowth.\n\n   A Worcester, Mass. company, Advanced Cell Technology, has\nsuggested one way to circumvent some moral questions, only to raise\nanother. It claims to have fused a human cell and a cow cell,\ncreating a hybrid that produces human stem cells, but could never\ngrow to be a person. The company says it later added a jellyfish\ngene to the hybrid in a first step toward learning how to guide the\ndevelopment of stem cells into specialized cells.\n\n   However, many people recoiled at the thought of crossing species\nlines, and the NIH explicitly barred that type of project from\nreceiving federal funds.\n\n   Some scientists believe the day will come when society assigns a\ndifferent status to an embryo based on its stage of development.\n\n   In the first 14 days of life, the embryo has not yet developed a\n``primitive streak,'' the precursor to a backbone. Once a backbone\ndevelops, the embryo can no longer split and become twins, and will\ngrow as a single being.\n\n   ``The cells have not decided to become an individual yet,'' said\nMichael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology.\n``There's no person at this point.'' West suggested that any type\nof research be permitted on embryos before 14 days and that\nresearch be barred or regulated after that point.\n\n   For Currie, the easiest solution is for Congress to continue its\nbar on embryo destruction while funding other promising\npossibilities.
