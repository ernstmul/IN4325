The smugglers,\nevidently spooked by an intensive search by federal agents, gave up\non attempts to extort more money from Ordonez and abandoned the boy\nin a Brownsville apartment complex at 2 a.m. with a telephone\nnumber pinned to the toddler's shirt.\n\n   Neither the boy nor his sister, who had been found Tuesday\nnight, was harmed. The children shyly answered reporters' questions\nduring their reunion with mom and appeared to be in good shape.\n\n   But, the tearful couple said they had been held for more than a\nmonth by members of a smuggling ring who had been paid $7,000 but\nwanted $3,500 more to complete the trip from Honduras to Houston.\n\n   The original price was $5,000 and the trip was to take eight\ndays, Ordonez, 24, said at the U.S. Border Patrol station near Port\nIsabel, a fishing community of 5,000 people about 25 miles\nnortheast of Brownsville near the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n   ``They threatened if we didn't send the money, they were going\nto do something to the little girl,'' said Luis Enrique Sandoval,\n32, a Houston construction worker who has dated Ordonez, who is in\nthe country illegally, for nine months and plans to marry her when\nhis own divorce is final.\n\n   ``That's when we started worrying,'' he continued, fighting back\ntears. ``They were telling us if we didn't send them the money _\nthe $3,500 _ that we would never see the kids anymore.''\n\n   Border Patrol officials who helped recover the young siblings\nsaid it has become increasingly common for smugglers to transport\nchildren without their parents, pairing them up with other clients\nwho claim to be relatives. Smugglers are aware that South Texas\nimmigration officials have limited facilities in which to detain\nwhole families, and often release illegal immigrants on bond after\ngiving them a court date.\n\n   ``It comes in spurts,'' said supervisory agent Francisco Lopez\nof the Border Patrol. ``Sometimes we'll have several unaccompanied\njuveniles in, say, a week's time and then we won't see any more for\ntwo or three weeks, and all of a sudden we'll run into another\nhandful of them.''\n\n   The search for Ordonez's children ended when Juan Angel\nMaradiaga, 2, was found wandering by himself outside a Brownsville\napartment complex around 2 a.m. after authorities received an\nanonymous call about the toddler, Lopez said.\n\n   On Tuesday night, agents found his older sister, Vanelisa\nMaradiaga, 6, with a group of more than 20 illegal immigrants\nstaying in several rooms in a hotel in downtown Brownsville. A\nwoman in the group first claimed to be the girl's mother but later\nadmitted that smugglers told her to lie, Lopez said.\n\n   Earlier that day, the children's mother had asked Sandoval to\ncontact Houston police and FBI agents and alert them the smugglers\nthreatened to harm her children if the extra $3,500 was not sent to\nBrownsville.\n\n   In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss confirmed agents were\ninvolved in running down leads and assisting Customs and Border\nPatrol agents working the case in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n   Ordonez said she works as a saleswoman at a ladies clothing shop\nin a Houston mall and has been in the United States for 16 months\nwithout immigration papers. She decided to have her two children,\nwho were living with her sister in the town of Olancho in Honduras,\nbrought to Houston because she feared her ex-husband in California\nwas planning to take custody of them.\n\n   Her former brother-in-law recommended a smuggler from El\nSalvador.\n\n   ``My brother-in-law told me (the smuggler) brings in little\nchildren and there wouldn't be a single problem,'' Ordonez said.\n``And also (the smuggler) called me and said, `Look lady, nothing\nwill happen to your children. You'll have them over there in eight\ndays' and this and that.''\n\n   Ordonez said she sent the smuggler $2,000 as a deposit and her\ntwo children left Honduras on June 18 for what was to be an\neight-day trip to Houston. She got calls for more money from El\nSalvador where, she said, her children were held for two weeks.\n\n   Border Patrol agents said no arrests have been made of those\nresponsible for smuggling the two children across the border.\n\n   Ordonez and her two children were detained for immigration\nprocessing but could be released and allowed to return to Houston\nto stay with Sandoval, officials said. If the couple marries, they\nadded, Sandoval, who is a citizen, could apply for legal residency\nfor Ordonez and the children.\n\n   ``I don't want to lose them,'' Sandoval said.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nBORDER AGENTS REUNITE HOUSTON MOTHER, CHILDREN AFTER BOTCHED\nSMUGGLING ATTEMPT \n\n","Text":["\n   PORT ISABEL, Texas _ A young Honduran immigrant Thursday ended\nan anxious monthlong wait on smugglers who were to deliver her two\nyoung children to Houston.\n","\n   Instead of meeting with smugglers, however, Esmeralda Ordonez\nand her fiance wept as U.S. Border Patrol agents reunited her with\nher 2-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter.
