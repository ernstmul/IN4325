The owner\nof that house was not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\n   Among those arrested late Monday was Beau Lee Lewis, 20, who\nfederal authorities allege ran an illegal reptile trade out of his\nparent's home in the 13400 block of South Watermann Lane in\nBuckeye.\n\n   Lewis was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Phoenix before\nMagistrate Morton Sitver, who ordered Lewis released to the custody\nof his parents and ordered not to leave his parents home until\nfurther court hearings take place in U.S. District Court in San\nFrancisco.\n\n   Lewis could not be reached for comment.\n\n   Federal officials identified him as the owner of Beau Lewis Rare\nReptiles, formerly Southwest Reptile Exchange, through which he\nreportedly sold rare animals illegally to customers throughout the\nU.S.\n\n   Also arrested late Monday were James Michael Burroughs, 47, of\nSan Francisco, and Keng Liang ``Anson'' Wong, 40, of Penang,\nMalaysia, who was taken into custody in Mexico City. Authorities\nare looking for a fourth suspect, Yuk Wah ``Oscar'' Shiu, 39, in\nHong Kong.\n\n   Wong is believed to be the kingpin of an international smuggling\noperation that plundered reptiles from southeast and central Asia,\nNew Zealand and Madagascar for sale in the U.S. and other markets,\naccording to a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n   Federal authorities said Burroughs worked as a courier for Wong.\n\n   The three were named in a 55-count federal indictment unsealed\nTuesday that alleges smuggling, money laundering, conspiracy, false\nstatement and violating wildlife laws, including the U.S.\nEndangered Species Act. They face penalties of up to 20 years in\nprison and fines of as much as $500,000 if convicted.\n\n   The indictment alleges that between January 1996 and Aug. 15,\nthe defendants illegally smuggled more than 300 animals worth\nnearly $500,000 into the U.S.\n\n   The animals were transported via human couriers, Federal Express\nshipments with false invoices and shipping documents, and concealed\nwithin larger shipments of legal animals, the indictment says.\n\n   The internationally protected animals were smuggled from\nMalaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines to the U.S.,\naccording to the indictment.\n\n   The smuggling of extremely rare animals, some found only in\nextremely limited habitats and near extinction, was denounced by\nJamie Rappaport Clark, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n   ``Sacrificing the world's legally protected rare species to meet\nthe demand for reptiles prized as exotic live collectibles will not\nbe tolerated by this country or by our global conservation\npartners,'' Clark said.\n\n   ``Stealing the world's natural treasures takes a toll that\ncannot be measured in dollars. It robs countries of their natural\nheritage, disrupts ecosystems and shortchanges future\ngenerations.''\n\n   Among the animals illegally traded for upwards of $30,000 each,\nwere:\n\n   Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard, which grows up to 10\nfeet long and is found only on Komodo Island and a few neighboring\nislands in Indonesia.\n\n   Tuatara, a 2-foot-long lizardlike reptile that is the only\nsurviving member of the taxonomic order ``Sphenodon punctatus.''\nAll the rest of the members of this animal group died off with the\ndinosaurs more than 60 million years ago. It is found on 30 small\nislands off the coast of New Zealand.\n\n   Ploughshare or angulated tortoise, found only on the island of\nMadagascar, off the southeast coast of Africa.\n\n   Lois Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment and\nnatural resources, credited the cooperation of Mexican agents and\nFederal Express in assisting in the arrests.\n\n   Other agencies involved in the investigation included the U.S.\nCustoms Service, INTERPOL and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n   The United States is the world's largest market for wildlife and\nwildlife products. Wildlife trade in this country is estimated to\nbe a $1 billion a year business.   \nSteve Yozwiak can be reached at 444-8810 or at\nsteve.yozwiak(at)pni.com via e-mail.  \n","Headline":"\nRARE REPTILES SEIZED IN ARIZONA \n","Text":["\n   An international smuggling ring involving 300 rare and\nendangered animals _ including giant Komodo dragons and other\nexotic creatures _ has been broken up with arrests in Arizona, San\nFrancisco and Mexico City.\n","\n   The arrests and animal confiscations resulted from an undercover\ninvestigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spanning more\nthan five years.\n","\n   Among those animals recovered Monday in the Phoenix area were\nfive white-lipped water monitors from Malaysia and a star tortoise\nfrom India, according to agents of the Fish and Wildlife Service.\nThose animals were discovered after a search warrant was served at\na home in the 2200 block of West Keating Avenue in Mesa.
