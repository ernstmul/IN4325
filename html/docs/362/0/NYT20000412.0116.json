They say at least 17 Mexican babies were placed\nin American homes before the authorities stepped in.\n\n   Some families paid $20,000 or more for adoptions of the\nchildren, some of whom had serious health problems, and none of\nwhom had proper documentation.\n\n   Reyes, a lawyer with dual Mexican and American citizenship,\nadmitted to paying Mexican mothers for the children, to hiring\nsmugglers to get the babies into the United States and to document\nfraud.\n\n   A fourth person, Margarita Soto de Smith, a resident of the\nMexican border town of Agua Prieta, across the border from Reyes'\nhome in Arizona, also was arrested by Mexican authorities on\ncharges that she was part of the smuggling ring.\n\n   Investigators said she described how Reyes found struggling\nMexican mothers willing to part with their newborns for money and\npromises of a better life.
