In a mother's womb, a host of\nhormones and enzymes guides an embryo's cells into ever-greater\ndifferentiation and specificity.\n\n   Stem cells are pluripotent because each has the capacity to\nbecome almost any of the more than 200 different kinds of cells in\nthe body.\n\n   When moved to laboratory vessels, they may within a few years be\nmanipulated into becoming whatever scientists want them to become.\n\n   That capacity could contain the tools for developing specific\ntypes of tissues to treat specific diseases _ diabetes,\nAlzheimer's, leukemia, for example _ as well as other cures no one\ncan begin even to anticipate.\n\n   But because their existence reaches into the central mystery of\nlife and involves the deliberate destruction of embryos and\nfetuses, stem cells raise profound moral and ethical concerns for\nmany individuals and religious groups.\n\n   Some students of bioethics say there is no doubt where the\ndebate will end.\n\n   The staggering medical promise of stem cell research gives it a\nconstituency of millions of health consumers who are desperate for\nbreakthroughs, says Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for\nBioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n   Such a constituency, he believes, will overwhelm any opposition\nto continued stem cell research.\n\n   ``Where this debate is going to end is a foregone conclusion,''\nCaplan said.\n\n   There is no shortage of embryos from which such stem cells might\nbe grown. According to some estimates, at least 50,000 ``spare''\nembryos currently sit frozen in liquid hydrogen in American\nfertilization clinics, discarded by the couples who produced them.\n\n   Congress has passed restrictions on the use of federal money to\nfinance research on human embryos.\n\n   However, in a controversial opinion released earlier this year,\nthe solicitor general of the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) declared that the law prohibited only research on\nembryos _ not on ``cell lines'' developed and grown from those\nembryos.\n\n   Since such cell lines can never become human beings, they are\nnot covered by the congressional ban, the legal opinion held.\n\n   Based on that, Harold Varmus, director of the National\nInstitutes of Health announced two weeks ago that NIH would not\nprovide money for scientists to develop stem cell cultures from\nembryos _ but would finance research on cell lines that were\ndeveloped without federal support. Thus, if approached by a\nscientist who already had established a line of stem cells and\ndestroyed the embryo from which they grew, NIH would feel free to\nconsider financing further research, Varmus said.\n\n   The institutes are a part of HHS. Varmus announced the decision\nto entertain requests for financing stem cell research during an\nappearance before the National Commission on Bioethics, a panel\ncreated by President Clinton following the cloning of Scotland's\nsheep ``Dolly'' in 1997.\n\n   Varmus said stem cell research needed a federal presence, else\nthe emerging science would be privately financed and therefore\nlargely unregulated.
