Times News Service    \n\n   Venturing deep into uncharted realms of ethics and medicine, a\nsmall biotechnology company said Wednesday that its scientists had\nfor the first time made human cells revert to the primordial,\nembryonic state from which all other cells develop, by fusing them\nwith cow eggs and creating a hybrid cell.\n\n   The research comes from biologists who are well known in their\nfield, but has yet to be confirmed or even published in a\nscientific journal. Their company, Advanced Cell Technology of\nWorcester, Mass., said the method could eventually be used to grow\nreplacement body tissues of any kind from a patient's own cells,\nsidestepping the increasing scarcity of organs available for\ntransplant and the problems of immune rejection.\n\n   The technique is likely to concern and perplex ethicists because\nit involves the creation of an embryonic cell that is part human\nand part cow, consisting of a human cell's nucleus inside a cow egg\nwhose own nucleus has been removed. The company said the hybrid\ncell quickly became more human-like as the human nucleus took\ncontrol and displaced cow proteins with human proteins. Creation of\nthe embryonic cells is an important component of a strategy that in\nprinciple offers high medical benefits if it can overcome a\ndoubtless high barrier to public acceptance.\n\n   The technique involves creating an embryo of uncertain moral\nstatus, and one that crosses the barrier between humans and other\nspecies. Even though the hybrid is in the form of cells, not a\nwhole organism, the concept of half-human creatures arouses deeps\nanxiety, as is evident from the unfriendly powers ascribed to\nwerewolves, centaurs, mermaids, Minotaurs and other characters of\nmyth and folklore.\n\n   ``Many people are going to be horrified by this scenario, others\nwill say 'So what?' '' said Thomas Murray, director of the center\nfor biomedical ethics at Case Western Reserve University in\nCleveland and a member of the National Bioethics Advisory\nCommission. ``This is the sort of thing that makes me very\nuncomfortable. I think we are likely to get a very powerful\nreaction to it, and I would like for all of us to have a breathing\nspace here to articulate our moral concerns.''\n\n   Another serious uncertainty is the preliminary nature of the\ncompany's work. No article has yet been submitted for peer review\nand publication in a scientific journal, an essential touchstone of\ncredibility. Scientists asked about the company's work said they\nwould require much more proof before believing that human embryonic\nstem-like cells had been created as claimed, and some were\nskeptical the technique would work at all.\n\n   The company said it had achieved the feat announced Wednesday\nwith one cell three years ago. Michael West, Advanced Cell\nTechnology's chief executive officer, said he was announcing the\nwork done to date in order to test its public acceptability He said\nthe company, which is privately held, was not planning to go public\nor raise money at this time but needed to decide whether to commit\ninvestment to development of the technique.\n\n   Some scientists praised West's decision to make his work public\nbut others are critical, saying he has invited an emotional public\ndebate on a slender basis of fact.\n\n   West is the founder of Geron, a biotechnology company that has\nhad two spectacular successes this year in its research on aging.\nIn January, the company developed a method for ``immortalizing''\nhuman cells grown in the laboratory by making them leap the\nsupposedly immutable barrier at which cells usually lapse into\nsenescence. Last week, two university teams financed by Geron said\nthey had isolated and cultivated human embryonic stem cells, the\nall-purpose cells from which the fetus develops. West lay the\nfoundations for these developments by financing leading scientists\nin the two fields.\n\n   Advanced Cell Technology, which West joined in October, has\nfocused on cloning and genetically improving cows, a technology\ndeveloped by James Robl and colleagues at the University of\nMassachusetts in Amherst. West said he hoped to use the technology\nto further the founding concept of Geron: delving into the mystery\nof human aging and sidestepping some of its processes.\n\n   The company said work with human cells was performed in 1996 by\nJose Cibelli, a colleague of Robl at the University of\nMassachusetts. Using 52 of his own cells, some of them white blood\ncells and others scraped from the inside of his cheek, Cibelli\nfused each one with a cow egg whose own nucleus and DNA had first\nbeen removed, the company said. Most failed to thrive but one\nembryo grew and divided five times, generating cells resembling\nembryonic stem cells. Cibelli and West say the method can be made\nmore efficient with present technology.\n\n   Considering this work was sufficient to describe an invention,\nRobl and Cibelli filed a patent application and then set the\nresearch aside to focus on the more immediately practical field of\ncow cloning. Only two others besides himself and Robl knew what had\nbeen done, Cibelli said. The patent has not yet been issued but\nWest said he was confident of receiving ``important intellectual\nproperty'' in the field. He said he is making the hybrid cell\ntechnique public now ``because I want to be very open and level\nwith everyone. We need to get the ethicists to talk about it so as\nto encourage a rational response to these new technologies.''\n\n   Cibelli said he regarded any embryos obtained in this way as\n``not a separate individual, just a de-differentiated cell from a\npatient.'' Differentiation is the process whereby the all-purpose\ncells of the very early embryo, known as human embryonic stem\ncells, become committed to their roles as the various specialized\ntissues of the body. The process is irreversible in nature but egg\ncells apparently have the ability to de-differentiate, or reset to\ndefault mode, the settings in a specialized cell's nucleus. This is\npresumably what happened in the experiment reported in July when\nmice were cloned by transferring the nucleus of an adult mouse cell\ninto another mouse's egg cell.\n\n   Cibelli, who trained as a veterinary doctor in Argentina, said\nhe believed that he and his colleagues ``were the first to\nde-differentiate a human cell by nuclear transfer.''\n\n   Asked if he was concerned about destroying, in principle, 52\npotential twins of himself, he said, ``I never thought about it,\nit's a good question. But if you use your own cells to treat a\ndisease you may have, you are not taking cells from another person\nselfishly.''\n\n   West and Cibelli said they had no intention of transferring the\nembryos to a uterus, a step they consider unethical and unsafe for\nit. The embryos would be created solely for the purpose of tissue\nculture. ``Any technology can be abused but once the public\nunderstands how these cells can be used to treat any disease caused\nby loss or malfunction of cells, from Parkinson's to diabetes to\nheart disease, the concerns will be overshadowed,'' West said.\n\n   Whether or not West's prediction will be borne out depends on\ntwo major sets of factors, the scientific validity of the proposed\nmethod and the ethical and legal questions that related work has\nalready raised.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
