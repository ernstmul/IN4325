Times News Service    \n\n   MIAMI _ Miami's large Cuban-American population was bristling\nwith outrage Wednesday, a day after the Coast Guard used water\npumps and pepper spray to turn back a boat carrying six Cuban\nrafters who had come within 150 yards of the Miami Beach coastline.\n\n   The incident, which was broadcast live on local television, was\nthe topic of the day on Spanish-language radio talk shows and\nprompted hundreds of protesters to take to the streets, blocking a\nroadway to Miami Beach and a main road in the predominantly Cuban\ncity of Hialeah.\n\n   Local politicians and angry commentators drew parallels between\nthe government of Fidel Castro and what they said were coercive\ntactics used by the U.S. government through the Coast Guard.\n\n   ``Today, the Statue of Liberty falls with her arms open wide,''\ndeclared Ninoska Perez, a commentator on WQBA radio and a member of\nthe Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful lobbying\norganization. The Spanish language newspaper El Nuevo Herald ran a\nheadline on Page One that read ``Insult to Human Dignity.''\n\n   A spokesman for the Coast Guard, Jibran Soto, said that the\nconduct of its officers in the incident was under investigation.\n\n   Some protesters directed their ire at the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service. A crowd of protesters picketed Wednesday\noutside the immigration service's Krome detention center in west\nMiami, where the six men were being held.\n\n   At issue in Tuesday's incident is an agreement between the\nUnited States and Cuba, signed in 1994, under which Cubans who are\nintercepted by the Coast Guard at sea are turned back no matter how\nclose they are to shore, while those who manage to make it ashore\nand turn themselves in to the authorities can be released on parole\nfor a year and a day and then issued a green card, a privilege\ngranted only to Cubans.\n\n   Soto said the six Cubans, all men, were spotted by a Coast Guard\nairplane on Tuesday afternoon about 400 yards from Florida's shore.\nFour Coast Guard vessels surrounded them, urging the Cubans to turn\nthemselves in, the Coast Guard said. The Cubans jumped off the boat\nand tried to swim the rest of the way.\n\n   One, Carlos Hernandez Cordoba, 29, said later that he had\nthreatened to commit suicide by getting stuck in the propellers of\nthe Coast Guard boats unless they allowed him to swim to shore.\nHernandez and Israel Ramos Consuegra, 18, managed to make it\nashore.\n\n   Daniel Kane, a spokesman for the immigration service in\nWashington, said that each of the six cases would be reviewed\nseparately. Officials are also investigating whether the men were\nbrought from Cuba by smugglers.\n\n   To many people here, the incident is an unfortunate chapter in\nthe enforcement of an immigration policy that, in trying to stave\noff a mass exodus from the island on the one hand and grant\nleniency to Cubans fleeing an enemy regime on the other, has led to\nerratic law enforcement.\n\n   Although Kane said that the agency had no plans to review its\nimmigration policy regarding Cubans, Dario Moreno, a professor of\npolitical science at Florida International University, said a\nreview might be inevitable.\n\n   Coming at the start of a presidential campaign, Moreno said, the\nincident could force the hands of both parties' front-runners, Vice\nPresident Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who have both\ntried to reach out to Hispanic groups.\n\n   Others said the incident was less about the flaws in immigration\npolicy than about the political influence of Cuban-Americans in\nSouth Florida.\n\n   ``The outcry is a function of the power of Cuban-American\npoliticians in South Florida and the spectacle of seeing the\nincident live,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration law\nat the University of Miami. ``The Cubans know that they enjoy a\nprivileged situation and they seek to exploit that privilege by\nsmuggling'' themselves in.\n","Headline":"\nTREATMENT OF CUBAN REFUGEES DRAWS ANGRY PROTEST IN MIAMI \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI _ Miami's large Cuban-American population was bristling\nwith outrage Wednesday, a day after the Coast Guard used water\npumps and pepper spray to turn back a boat carrying six Cuban\nrafters who had come within 150 yards of the Miami Beach coastline.\n","\n   The incident, which was broadcast live on local television, was\nthe topic of the day on Spanish-language radio talk shows and\nprompted hundreds of protesters to take to the streets, blocking a\nroadway to Miami Beach and a main road in the predominantly Cuban\ncity of Hialeah.\n","\n   Local politicians and angry commentators drew parallels between\nthe government of Fidel Castro and what they said were coercive\ntactics used by the U.S. government through the Coast Guard.\n","\n   ``Today, the Statue of Liberty falls with her arms open wide,''\ndeclared Ninoska Perez, a commentator on WQBA radio and a member of\nthe Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful lobbying\norganization.
