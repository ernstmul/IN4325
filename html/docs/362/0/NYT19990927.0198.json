The Kendall Square area\nof Cambridge, Mass. _ next door to the Whitehead Institute at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, a key node in the\ngovernment-sponsored Human Genome Project _ has become a magnet for\ncompanies working on gene-based diagnostic tools and treatments.\nThey are expected to become increasingly important in the regional\neconomy.\n\n   By spring, the Human Genome Project will have produced a rough\ndraft of the human genome, what some scientists refer to as the\n``Book of Life,'' the basic instructions for operating the human\nbody. The complete text of all human DNA will be posted on the\nInternet for anyone to use.\n\n   ``This may be the most important step we've taken in science,''\nsaid James Watson, who helped launch the new era of genetics nearly\n50 years ago by discovering, with Francis Crick, the structure of\ndeoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\n\n   ``We've got our instruction book: how to build the 747,'' Watson\nsaid. ``We can't read it all yet. But that we've evolved to where\nwe can have the book, that's pretty good.''\n\n   Scientists involved in the genome project say they are building\na kind of public infrastructure that will fuel a boom in medical\nresearch, just as the interstate highway system laid the groundwork\nfor the nation's economic growth.\n\n   Their work will prove to be more important than splitting the\natom or putting a man on the moon, said Dr. Francis Collins, a\ngeneticist at the National Institutes of Health who acts as\ncoordinator of the Human Genome Project.\n\n   ``This is going to change the way medicine is practiced, and it\nwill forever alter the way biological and medical research is\ndone,'' Collins said. It could bring new treatments for every\nsingle human disease, he added.\n\n   DNA is carried by every person, in the heart of almost every\ncell. It is made up of four chemicals linked in a huge chain\nestimated at 3 billion chemicals in length. Mapping it all has been\na decade-long task involving thousands of scientists in\nlaboratories around the world. The rough draft of the human genome\nwill list the order of all 3 billion chemicals, but it may contain\nsome errors. A final version is expected in 2003.\n\n   With the genome text in hand, Collins and others say,\nresearchers will be able to find all the estimated 80,000 to\n140,000 human genes, or segments of DNA that tell cells how to\nfunction. Finding the genes and understanding their work in the\nbody will allow scientists to develop medical treatments that\nattack disease at its root cause.\n\n   Doctors hope one day to replace the faulty genes responsible for\nillnesses like cystic fibrosis. New drugs that make some genes more\nactive and others less active may treat hypertension, obesity, and\nheart disease.\n\n   By studying genes more closely, researchers should deepen their\nunderstanding of human behavior and mental illnesses such as\nschizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. By analyzing a\nperson's genes, doctors might be able to diagnose an illness long\nbefore the patient develops symptoms.\n\n   But some see risks. Just as the World War II-era Manhattan\nProject brought the risk of nuclear war to an unprepared world, the\nhuman genome project could give scientists potent genetic tools\nbefore society has sorted out their implications.\n\n   As scientists fashion new treatments for cancer or obesity by\nmanipulating genes, they may also learn how to alter the genes that\ncontrol traits such as height, athleticism, or intelligence.\nScientists have already reported manipulating genes to make\nlaboratory mice ``smarter'' and ``more sociable.'' That leaves\nsociety to face questions about which traits should be changed,\nwhich left alone, and who should have power to decide.\n\n   ``Even those of us who don't take Genesis literally see a vast\nmystery in the origin of our species and in each of our\ndestinies,'' said Ronald Green, a Dartmouth College professor who\nserved as an ethicist to the Human Genome Project.\n\n   Now, he said, we are learning how to change, almost at will, the\nblueprint for building a human being. ``We can fashion new life\nforms; we are already doing that,'' Green said. ``Some of us see us\ntaking the evolution of our species into our own hands.''\n\n   As scientists learn to diagnose diseases by analyzing genes, the\npublic will have to decide what to do with the knowledge. Should a\n7-year-old be told that she may develop breast cancer at age 35 or\nAlzheimer's at age 70? Should her insurance company know? What if\nthere were no steps she could take to cut her risk?\n\n   US law allows companies to patent genes, but some critics argue\nthat the genome is a natural human resource that shouldn't be\nlicensed to anyone exclusively. Critics also fear that putting so\nmuch emphasis on the importance of genes could lead people into\nextreme ``genetic determinism'' _ the notion that most human\nactivity is dictated by genes _ and prompt discrimination based on\npeoples' DNA.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Genes are small sections of DNA scattered throughout the genome\nthat tell cells how to handle the daily tasks of life, such as\nreproducing, fighting illness, and communicating with other cells.\nThey tell an embryo how to turn into a fetus and a child how to\nturn into an adult. Specifically, each gene tells the cells how to\nbuild a protein, and proteins, in turn, are the agents that do work\nin the body.\n\n   Many illnesses can be traced to a flawed gene or set of genes,\nwhich produce a faulty protein or too much or too little of a\nprotein. In fact, nearly every illness seems to have a genetic\ncomponent, even those in which a person's behavior or living\nconditions clearly play a role. Why does one french fry-lover\ndevelop clogged arteries while another doesn't? Why does one\nasbestos factory worker develop cancer while another remains\nhealthy? At least in part, scientists say, the answer is in the\ngenes.\n\n   It will take decades to find all the genes and learn how they\nfunction in the body and interact with each other.So far, progress\nhas been slow. Even knowing which genes are responsible for cystic\nfibrosis, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and many other\nillnesses, scientists have not come up with cures. Gene therapy,\nthe attempt to replace faulty genes with new ones, has still to\nprove successful after more than two decades of research.\n\n   ``What really bothers me is the hype going along with these\nprojects, giving the sense that cures are just around the corner,''\nsaid Jonathan Beckwith, a Harvard microbiologist and an advisory\nboard member of the Council for Responsible Genetics in Cambridge.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nRESEARCH TRANSLATES INTO A DNA REVOLUTION \n","Text":["\n   Scientists using the most powerful computers ever brought to\nbear on human biology are within months of completing a first\nreading of the genetic ``Book of Life,'' the information coded in\nDNA that says why one person looks and acts differently than\nanother, why some are more prone to fall sick, and what exactly\ngoes awry in the body when that happens.\n","\n   This work, underway in laboratories from Cambridge to Tokyo, is\nalmost certain to ignite a revolution in medicine in the early 21st\ncentury.\n","\n   Such knowledge should help doctors and researchers understand\nmore about disease: what causes a child to develop cancer, a\nteenager to have schizophrenia, and an older person to be stricken\nby Alzheimer's disease.\n","\n   And if researchers' highest hopes are met, knowledge of the\nhuman DNA code will help scientists fashion novel treatments for\nnearly every human ailment.\n","\n   Already the new genetic information is fueling a boom in\npharmaceutical and biotechnology research.
