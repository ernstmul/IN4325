Marijuana and weapons that may be\nlinked to the crime have been seized in the town of Tecate along\nthe U.S.-Mexico border, he said.\n\n   Members of an extended family _ including a 1-year-old baby in\ndiapers and seven children between the ages of 2 and 16 _ were\ndragged from their beds before dawn Thursday, herded against a low\nwall and shot with automatic weapons and pistols.\n\n   ``We can't begin to measure the brutality of the attack,'' de la\nFuente said.  \n\n     Attacks on rivals' family members are rare in the Mexican drug\nunderworld.\n\n   Federal and state authorities said the apparent target of the\nattack was Fermin Castro, head of a small marijuana-smuggling gang\nbased in Ensenada that had loose ties to powerful gangsters in\nTijuana.\n\n   Castro, 38, a cattle rancher and rodeo promoter nicknamed the\n``Indian Cowboy,'' survived the shooting but is in a coma with a\ngunshot wound to the head.\n\n   Authorities said that Castro had apparently been tortured before\nhe and the others were shot.\n\n   Jose Luis Chavez, the top federal law enforcement official in\nBaja California, said a chair in Castro's house was stained with\nblood, as if someone had been interrogated there. There were\nindications that Castro had been beaten, Chavez said.\n\n   Those killed include Castro's wife and their 2-year-old son; the\nsister of Castro's wife, her husband and their children; and\nCastro's sister, her husband, and their children. One of the five\nslain women was eight months pregnant.\n\n   A 12-year-old nephew of Castro is hospitalized with bullet\nwounds. A 15-year-old niece apparently hid from the assailants and\nescaped unharmed.\n\n   ``It has been violent here, but never like this,'' said Gerardo,\na neighbor of the victims who declined to give his last name. ``I\ncan't believe this. These were good people.''\n\n   Fermin Castro was well known in El Sauzal, a suburb of Ensenada\nabout a 90-minute drive south of the U.S. border that is a confused\njumble of fish canneries, U.S.-owned electronics factories and neat\nhouses of wealthy retirees from California. Castro had put on a\nrodeo Tuesday night not far from his home to help celebrate\nMexico's independence holiday.\n\n   Members of his extended family lived in a small walled compound\nof three houses tucked behind a ceramics factory.\n\n   Soldiers guarded the compound Friday, refusing access, as law\nenforcement investigators went through the houses and the yards.\n\n   Officials said Friday that the Ensenada area, a favorite weekend\nand vacation destination for people from Southern California, has\nbecome increasingly caught up in the drug trade.\n\n   ``We had indications that the problems here in Ensenada were\ngetting worse, that drug trafficking was getting worse,'' Chavez\nsaid. ``This is all because of the proximity to the border.

The Mexican federal police\nhave become involved in the investigation of the Ensenada killings\nbecause of suspected links to drug smuggling, a federal crime.\n\n   Chavez said authorities had been watching Castro's organization\nbut had failed to act on their suspicions. A recent article in\nZeta, a weekly newspaper in Tijuana, listed Castro's group among\nabout a half-dozen drug smuggling organizations that it said were\nflourishing in the Ensenada area.\n\n   Chavez said Castro's small smuggling band unloaded\nmarijuana-laden planes on clandestine airstrips near Ensenada and\ntransported the drug to the border for sale in the United States.\n\n   Many such small gangs operate in Baja California, paying fees to\nlarger drug organizations for the right to smuggle, Chavez said.\nCastro's and other small bands in the Ensenada area paid protection\nmoney to an associate of the powerful Arellano Felix drug gang in\nTijuana, Chavez said.\n\n   But Chavez and other officials said there was no evidence that\nmembers of Castro's group directly worked for the Arellano Felix\norganization or were killed because of that gang's ongoing power\nstruggle with other smugglers.\n\n   Many experts consider the Arellano Felix organization, headed by\nfour brothers from a well-to-do Tijuana family, as the most\nimportant criminal organization in Mexico.
