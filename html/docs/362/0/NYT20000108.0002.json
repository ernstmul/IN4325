Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:\n\n   Fueled by oil revenues, diamond smuggling and a disregard for\ncivilian lives on all sides, Angola's ruinous civil war has\nstubbornly outlasted the Cold-War machinations that ratcheted up\nthe death toll in the 1980s. Upward of 1 million Angolans have died\nin 25 years of fighting and famine, and tens of thousands have been\nmaimed by land mines. Unicef recently called Angola the worst place\non earth for children _ a country where 30 percent of them will die\nbefore the age of 5.\n\n   But a recent series of military advances by government forces\nmay mean the war is nearing a decisive phase. It is far too early\nto tell, but clearly an opportunity is at hand for the rest of the\nworld to pressure both sides to devise a lasting peace based on\ndemocratic values and respect for human rights.\n\n   With the end of the Cold War Angola's conflict has evolved into\na crude competition between government and rebel forces for power\nand profits from the country's rich deposits of diamonds, oil and\ngas. A cease-fire collapsed in 1992 after President Eduardo Dos\nSantos won an election and Jonas Savimbi, the rebel leader,\ncynically resumed the fighting. A second cease-fire in 1994 fell\napart a year ago when the government accused the rebels of\nstockpiling arms and attacked. Savimbi had in fact rearmed with the\nbenefit of several billion dollars in diamond-smuggling revenues.\n\n   Now Dos Santos' forces, strengthened by escalating oil profits,\nhave driven the rebels out of nearly three-quarters of the country,\nand the fighting has spilled into neighboring Namibia. Savimbi, who\nreceived South African and U.S. support during the Cold War,\ndeserves little sympathy. He has broken numerous promises and\nruthlessly pursued his own agenda. But the rest of the world would\nbe mistaken if it unconditionally embraced Dos Santos. Though his\ngovernment was legitimately elected and has long since abandoned\nits original Marxist creed, it has been responsible for widespread\nrights violations in recent years.\n\n   The new U.S. representative to the United Nations, Richard\nHolbrooke, set the right tone on a visit to Angola when he said the\nUnited States would throw its weight _ and, it is hoped, its\nintelligence capabilities _ behind a Canadian-led effort to tighten\nand enforce sanctions on Savimbi's diamond- and weapons-smuggling\noperations. At the same time he spoke bluntly about the\ngovernment's human rights abuses and met with an Angolan editor who\nhad been imprisoned and tortured. It was a welcome departure from\nthe record of recent years in which an U.S.-backed U.N.\npeacekeeping unit too often accommodated Angola's warlords by\noverlooking their flagrant abuses.  \n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: PERSISTENT WAR IN ANGOLA \n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 8:\n","\n   Fueled by oil revenues, diamond smuggling and a disregard for\ncivilian lives on all sides, Angola's ruinous civil war has\nstubbornly outlasted the Cold-War machinations that ratcheted up\nthe death toll in the 1980s.
