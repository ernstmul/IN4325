Times News Service   \n\n   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sharply worded report, Amnesty International\non Monday accused the government of Saudi Arabia of widespread\nhuman rights abuses including arbitrary arrests, the torture of\ndetainees and the barring of prisoners' access to family members or\nlawyers.\n\n   The group said it had received and published graphic accounts of\nmistreatment, discrimination against religious minorities and\nsuppression of political dissent in the gulf kingdom for years. But\nSaudi Arabia has escaped international condemnation for its record,\nAmnesty officials added, because oil-dependent nations like the\nUnited States have not wanted to offend the kingdom's rulers.\n\n   Saudi officials, who rarely respond to outside critics, this\ntime reacted swiftly, emphatically rejecting Amnesty's findings as\nbiased and inaccurate.\n\n   ``We have nothing to hide in human rights,'' said Prince Turki\nbin Mohammedi, the deputy foreign minister responsible for\ninternational organizations, in a telephone interview from the\nSaudi capital Riyadh. ``There is no harm in having their point of\nview, but they have to be more accurate in their information.''\n\n   The executive director of Amnesty's U.S. affiliate, William F.\nSchulz, said the human rights organization will try to spotlight\nthe Saudi record through a worldwide publicity campaign this year.\n\n   ``Amnesty International does launch one or two major campaigns a\nyear aimed at countries with particularly serious human rights\nviolations,'' said Schulz. ``In the case of Saudi Arabia, the\ncountry has gotten away with arbitrary detention and torture for\nyears, while escaping international scrutiny.''\n\n   The campaign will begin on Tuesday with a truck-mounted\nbillboard _ the most aggressive tactic ever used by Amnesty's\nAmerican office _ that will be driven around Washington. The\nbillboard will feature an amputated hand over the slogan: ``This\nsuffering is the secret of Saudi justice.''\n\n   The Amnesty report consolidated accounts of mistreatment of\ndetainees and more general human rights abuses that it said it had\nreceived or learned through media reports about Saudi Arabia during\nthe past 20 years.\n\n   ``What this research clearly reveals is that people who are\narrested in Saudi Arabia for whatever reason find themselves\ntrapped in a criminal justice system that provides them with no\ninformation about their fate, allows them no prompt contact with\ntheir families or a doctor, and offers them no hope of contacting a\nlawyer,'' the report said.\n\n   Much of the organization's report concerned the broader Saudi\nsystem itself, which bans political parties as well as criticism of\nthe royal family and government. Amnesty maintained that extralegal\ntorture and arrests take place and that even the country's legal\nforms of punishment violate international norms in their cruelty.\n\n   The critique ventures into the sensitive issue of how the rulers\nand religious leaders in the tightly controlled and insular kingdom\ninterpret Islam.\n\n   The Saudi legal system is based on its leaders' strict\ninterpretation of Shariah, or Islamic religious law, undiluted by\nany attempt to reconcile it to modern sensibilities. Death\nsentences are carried out by a firing squad for women and by\nbeheading, often in a public square, for men. Capital crimes range\nfrom murder and drug smuggling to apostasy and moral corruption.\nThe punishment for repeated thievery is the amputation of one or\nmore of the convicted person's limbs.\n\n   The severity of these penalties, the Amnesty report said, is\nmade worse by a lack of safeguards to guarantee fair trials and\nappeals.\n\n   In response to a request for comment on the Amnesty report, the\nSaudi Foreign Ministry said the country's laws already provide\nstringent guidelines for how police and security officials should\ndeal with prisoners and people they arrest.
