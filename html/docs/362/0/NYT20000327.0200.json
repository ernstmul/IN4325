And, as\nreported in The Washington Post, Amnesty ``catalogued a series of\nviolent crimes committed by police against suspects. Suspects have\nbeen tortured to death with electric cattle prods, placed on\nburning stoves, drowned in buckets, hanged and have died from a\nheart attack after being beaten by police.''\n\n   There are also reports of China making products in forced labor\ncamps, with workers earning 13 to 35 cents an hour, and having\nthese products sold in US stores.\n\n   As for trade agreements with China, the United States Trade\nRepresentative and the US State Department reported that over the\npast 10 years, China has violated every trade agreement, four since\n1992, it has signed with the United States.\n\n   With all these human rights and trade violations, rights\nactivists raise a legitimate issue as to why Clinton, members of\nCongress, and others who are strong advocates of human rights\nsupport giving China permanent trade status while ending the annual\ncongressional review.\n\n   Clinton and other supporters of the bill argue that granting\nChina permanent trade status would eliminate barriers to US\nproducts, expand US exports, and create good jobs in the United\nStates. Not supporting this bill would hurt US businesses, they\nsay. And, they further argue, the best way to improve human rights\nin China is to give China this permanent trade status and bring it\ninto the World Trade Organization where the country would be forced\nto play by the rules.\n\n   Of course, China has a strong record of not playing by the rules\nwhen it comes to human rights and trade, and there is strong\nevidence that it is not likely to change suddenly if it is given\npermanent trade status and brought into the WTO.\n\n   Amnesty International and other human rights groups, as well as\nthe AFL-CIO and other labor groups, are right to point to China's\nhuman-rights and trade violations as sufficient reason not to give\npermanent trade status without China improving its very poor record\non these issues.\n\n   But Democrats and organized labor also know how important it is\nto elect the expected Democratic presidential nominee, Vice\nPresident Al Gore, in November.
