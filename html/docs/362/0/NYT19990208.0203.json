Times News Service   \n\n   Six years ago, scientists in Canada published a remarkable\npaper. In it, they reported that they had grown entire mice from\nindividual cells that they had plucked from mouse embryos.\n\n   At the time, it was seen by those in the small world of mouse\nresearchers as a technological tour de force. But now, as\nscientists are eyeing human embryo cells as material for research,\nthe experiment is giving rise to a thorny philosophical question.\n\n   If you can grow a mouse from a single embryo cell, you should in\ntheory be able to grow a human from a single human embryo cell. And\nif you can grow a human from a single embryo cell, is that cell the\nmoral equivalent of an entire embryo? Where, in other words, does\nthe potential for human life lie?\n\n   There are no simple answers anymore, ethicists say.\n\n   ``There's a certain ambiguity or complexity that wasn't\nappreciated before,'' said Dr. Thomas Murray, the director of the\nHastings Center, an organization that studies ethical issues.\n\n   But even debating the question is a political mine field, some\nexperts say. The answers can determine whether scientists can go\nahead with experiments on isolated human embryo cells that they\nhope will revolutionize medicine or whether they will be required\nto treat single human embryo cells with the same sort of restraint\nthat they treat a human embryo.\n\n   ``People who hold a pro-life view regard the human embryo from\nthe moment of conception as a fully protectable human being,'' said\nDr. Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute of Dartmouth\nCollege. And so discussions of whether embryo cells are the\nequivalent of embryos or the equivalent of human tissue, like skin\nor muscle, are being carried out with the abortion debates looming\nin the background. ``That's a tremendous pressure in these\ndiscussion,'' Green said.\n\n   The mouse embryo cells that the Canadian scientists studied were\nof a special type, known as stem cells, that in theory can grow\ninto any tissues or organs, although not _ most assumed until the\nexperiment six years ago _ into an entire healthy mouse.\n\n   Researchers have worked with mouse embryonic stem cells for\nyears, but only recently have scientists been able to isolate human\nembryonic stem cells, a result that has profound implications.\nScientists speak of learning to push human embryonic stem cells\nalong a pathway to become a spongy bone marrow, brimming with red\nand white blood cells, or a pancreas that could squirt out insulin\nfor a person with diabetes or a fresh new layer of skin for a burn\npatient.\n\n   There is just one problem: the federal government bans the use\nof its money for research in which human embryos are destroyed or\ndiscarded. The question was, where does that leave embryo stem\ncells?\n\n   In a recent decision, lawyers for the Department of Health and\nHuman Services wrote that human embryonic stem cells were not\nincluded in the research ban. The reason, the National Institutes\nof Health wrote in a statement, was that the cells ``are not an\nembryo as defined by statute'' and that since human embryonic stem\ncells ``do not have the capacity to develop into a human being,\nthey cannot be considered human embryos consistent with the\ncommonly accepted or scientific meaning of that term.''\n\n   Nonsense, says Dr. Lee Silver, a mouse geneticist at Princeton\nUniversity. If what matters, as the government lawyers wrote, is\n``the capacity to develop into a human being,'' then human\nembryonic stem cells are the moral equivalent of embryos.\n``Metaphysically, it's all the same,'' Silver said.\n\n   He thinks research with human embryo cells should be permitted\nbut is offended, he said, by all the winking and nodding by\nscientists who do not want to admit the true potential of these\ncells to become a baby, if anyone wanted to try.\n\n   Silver's position on the nature of stem cells is supported by\nDr. Andras Nagy, the University of Toronto scientist who created\nmice out of stem cells six years ago in collaboration with a\ncolleague, Dr. Janet Rossant. Nagy said that he saw no reason why a\nhuman embryonic stem cell could not become a human being. ``I don't\nthink there's a theoretical or practical impossibility of creating\na completely stem-cell derived human being, if one wanted to do\nthat.''\n\n   Others drew fine distinctions over what it meant to have a\n``capacity'' to develop into a human being. They pointed out that\nNagy and Dr. Rossant had to wrap their embryonic stem cells in a\nsort of artificial placenta when they dropped them into a female\nmouse's uterus. The ``placenta'' was a clump of genetically\ndisabled cells that could not grow or become part of the developing\nfetus but could temporarily protect the stem cells and help them\nattach to the uterine wall.\n\n   Dr. John Gearhart of the Johns Hopkins University School of\nMedicine, who led one of the two research groups that isolated\nhuman embryonic stem cells, said the real question was whether the\nstem cells by themselves could grow into a person. ``The bottom\nline has to be that these cells in and of themselves are not\ncapable of doing that,'' he said. He added that the genetically\ndisabled cells ``are absolutely essential,'' explaining that they\n``enable the embryonic stem cells to get through the very early\nstages of embryo development.''\n\n   ``There is a real biological difference between an embryonic\nstem cell and a fertilized egg,'' said Dr. Brigid Hogan, a mouse\nembryonic stem-cell researcher at Vanderbilt University.\n\n   The problem, said Green, is that people are still trying to use\nbiology to draw moral lines in the sand, and biology just does not\nsuffice anymore. Questions arise with cloning because then any cell\nof the body could, in theory, be used to make a new human being,\nGreen said. And, he added, they arise with stem cells, because they\ncould become a human being with a lot less laboratory manipulation.\nThe result, he said, is that ``the lines get very difficult to\ndraw.''\n\n   ``People like to think that the biology is going to tell us\nsomething definitive,'' Green said.
