Times News Service   \n\n   COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y. _ The publicly financed effort to\ndecode the human genome, the 3 billion units of DNA at the heart of\nevery human cell, is now 10 percent complete and is on track to\nmeet its goal of finishing a first draft of the genome a year from\nnow, officials of the National Institutes of Health said Friday.\n\n   Decoding the genome, which holds the cell's genetic programming\ninstructions, is regarded as a fundamental step toward\nunderstanding the design of the human body and its propensity to\ndisease. Because all diseases have a genetic component, knowledge\nof the genome's precise sequence of DNA units should lead to\nfundamental advances in many branches of medicine.\n\n   Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of\nHealth's share of the human genome project, told scientists meeting\nat the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that the impending completion\nof the genome represented a ``historic time in science.''\n\n   ``This is the most important organized scientific effort that\nhumankind has ever attempted,'' Collins said. ``It dwarfs going to\nthe moon.''\n\n   His remarks were made in the presence of Dr. James D. Watson,\nwho with Dr. Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA in 1953.\nAs first director of the institutes' human genome project, Watson\nset its completion date as 2005, a goal he judged technically\nfeasible.\n\n   Watson's hope of seeing his project produce a complete sequence\nof human DNA within his lifetime faltered briefly last year when a\nnewly formed private company, Celera, announced that it would\ncomplete the human genome by 2001. For a few days, officials at the\ninstitutes seemed inclined to cede the field to Celera and its\naggressive leader, Dr. J. Craig Venter. Venter has suggested that\nwhen he succeeds, the public consortium's efforts will be seen as\nunnecessary.\n\n   But the institutes' efforts quickly resumed after their partner\nin the public consortium, the richly endowed Wellcome Trust of\nLondon, said the publicly financed effort should continue.\n\n   Friday's meeting took on some of the overtones of a pep rally\nwhen photographs of Venter were projected in a context that drew\nlaughter from the audience, which included many scientists who work\nat the genome-sequencing centers financed by the public consortium.\n\n   Wearing a canary-yellow sweater and a floppy hat, Watson sat in\nfront of the audience as the progress of the genome-sequencing\nproject was announced. Collins projected onto a screen the first\npage of Watson's 1953 article in the journal Nature, noting that if\nthe decoding was completed by 2003, as planned, exactly half a\ncentury would have elapsed between the two events.\n\n   Collins also stressed the ideological difference between the two\ncamps by emphasizing the public consortium's goal of putting the\nhuman genome sequence in the hands of the world's scientists as\nsoon as possible, without fees or restrictions. Celera does not\nplan to make all its sequence data immediately available, although\nVenter has said scientists will have free access to parts of it.\n\n   Venter's challenge to the public consortium preceded a recent\ncentralization of its efforts and a sharpening of focus. The\nvarious university sequencing centers financed by the health\ninstitutes have been reduced to four, and the smaller, less\nefficient centers have been cut out of the action.\n\n   The surviving centers now hold weekly conference calls and\nsubmit to a certain amount of central planning, which they had\npreviously avoided.\n\n   Besides moving up its target date for the complete genome\nsequence to 2003 from 2005, the public consortium has said it will\nproduce a ``first draft'' _ 90 percent of the sequence containing\nthe majority of all human genes _ by next spring.\n\n   The decision to produce and publish a first-draft DNA sequence\nmay make it harder for commercial ventures like Celera to lock up\nsignificant stretches of the genome with patent claims.\n\n   But the decision carries a certain cost in that the two-stage\nprocess of producing a first draft and then a complete sequence is\nless efficient than finishing the whole sequence with no\nintermediate stage.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Despite the progress made since 1996, when human genome\nsequencing started in earnest, its completion cannot be taken for\ngranted. Both the ends and the middles of human chromosomes, the\nunits in which DNA is packaged, consist of highly repetitive\nregions of DNA that may be hard to decode.\n\n   So far no human chromosome has been completed, although the long\nDNA molecule, which is chromosome 22, has been half-sequenced and\nscientists hope to finish it this year.\n\n   Sitting in his office after the meeting, Watson, who is\npresident of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, called the public\nconsortium's progress ``extremely satisfying.''\n\n   One-third of the human genome sequence is to be finished by the\nSanger Center, near Cambridge, England.
