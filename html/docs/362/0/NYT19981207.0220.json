Times News Service   \n\n   The blueprint for making a person is not a set of plans showing\nwhat a finished heart or kidney looks like and how all the\ndifferent organs are plumbed together. It is almost certainly a\nprogram, not a description, a series of steps that directs a\nhandful of embryonic cells into progressively more specialised\ntissues.\n\n   Interacting with each other through a burst of chemical signals,\nthe cells proliferate and slowly organize themselves into the\nprogram's end product, the miracle of a mewling infant.\n\n   Human embryonic stem cells _ the cells at the beginning of this\nbiological unfolding _ have now been isolated for the first time\nand scientists last week promised Congress that they would soon be\nable to mimic parts of nature's program in the laboratory, making\nheart, blood and nerve cells to replace or fortify diseased\ntissues.\n\n   Should the technique work, it could well change the face of\nmedicine by providing a universal spare parts kit for the human\nbody. No longer would patients have to wait in line for scarce\ntransplantable organs; their failing hearts would be injected with\nheart muscle cells grown from human embryonic cells.\n\n   The cells would be genetically manipulated so as to avoid\nprovoking the patient's immune defenses, and immortalized with a\ngene that enables cells to divide indefinitely instead of growing\nold after an allotted number of divisions.\n\n   From the cornucopia of embryonic stem cells, biologists would\nalso spin off nerve cells for Parkinson's disease patients,\npancreatic islet cells for diabetics and endothelial cells to\nreline tired blood vessels, Dr. Tom Okarma told a Senate committee\nlast week. Okarma is vice president for research of Geron, the\ncompany that funded the stem cells' development.\n\n   The principle of growing replacement tissue cells from embryonic\nstem cells was also endorsed at the hearing by Dr. Harold Varmus,\ndirector of the National Institutes of Health. But a sizeable gap\nstill yawns between theory and practice.\n\n   The chemical messages the cells exchange as they travel down\ndevelopmental paths to their destined cell type are almost\ncompletely unknown. Biologists will need to identify these signals\nbefore they acquire complete mastery over the cell's lineages and\nfate.\n\n   But there is a large bank of knowledge to draw on, derived from\nstudies of how simpler organisms develop, like sea urchins,\nroundworms, fruit flies, frogs and mice.\n\n   ``The field has exploded over the last 10 years,'' said Dr.\nSally A. Moody, a biologist at George Washington University and\neditor of ``Cell Lineage and Fate Determination'' (Academic Press).\nBecause of similarities in evolution's design, an overall picture\nof embryonic development is emerging, Dr. Moody said, ``but the\nperception that scientists know how to choose any cell fate is\nwrong. We know a lot about particular cell fates but we don't have\nall the pieces worked out by any means.''\n\n   All cells in the human body have a full set of genes, but as\ncells progress down different lineages, they presumably activate\nthe particular suite of genes that tells them how to operate as a\nhair cell or kidney cell or whatever is appropriate to their\nneighborhood. The first main step of development is when the\nall-purpose embryonic cells differentiate into the three tissues of\nthe early embryo: the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.\n\n   In backboned animals, the gut, liver and lungs develop from the\nendoderm; the mesoderm gives rise to the skeleton, muscle, kidney,\nheart and blood, and the ectoderm generates two not obviously\nkindred tissues, the skin and the nerve cells.\n\n   This division of labor is thought to be accomplished by chemical\nsignals that cells secrete to influence their neighbors, along with\nreceptors they insert in their outer membranes to receive these\nsignals.\n\n   ``It's a language of signals and receptors,'' said Dr. Roger\nPedersen, a biologist at the University of California, San\nFrancisco, who studies development in mice and humans. ``We know\nthe semantics, but we don't understand them because we can't\neavesdrop on the embryo very well, where this intimate conversation\nis going on.''\n\n   A few words in this code have been deciphered. Embryonic stem\ncells can be driven to develop into nerve cells by exposing them to\nthe chemical known as retinoic acid. Certain growth factors\ninfluence the development of blood-forming cells.\n\n   Â  \nnn\n\n   ``One could generalize to say we know that the language being\nspoken within the emrbyo as it forms these cell types is the\nlanguage of growth factors, but we don't know how to decode the\nparticular sentences of messages that the individual cell types\nhear,'' Pedersen said.\n\n   A development that may provide many of the words in this vital\nlanguage comes from research undertaken by Human Genome Sciences of\nRockville, Md. Dr. William A. Haseltine, its chairman and chief\nexecutive officer, said that the company has now isolated more than\n75 percent of all human genes in full length form. From them the\ncompany's scientists as of this week have identified 14,387 genes\nwhose products are predicted to be proteins that are either\nexported from the cell as chemical signals or inserted into the\nmembrane as receptors, Haseltine said.\n\n   The identification was accomplished by setting a computer to\nsearch for the sequence of DNA letters that are the zip code, under\nthe cell's protein sorting system, for all proteins destined to be\nexported or used as membrane receptors. These 14,000 proteins,\nHaseltine said, comprise almost the entire gene-encoded signals\ncommunication system between human cells.\n\n   A ``big fundamental surprise,'' he said, is that some 12,000 of\nthese genes have no family relationship to any genes found in the\nC. elegans roundworm, whose DNA sequence is now almost complete.\nThis implies that higher animals invented a much more sophisticated\nintercellular communications system as they evolved away from the\nworm.\n\n   The 14,000 signals and receptors, Haseltine said, would be\nexpected to include those that are involved in embryonic\ndevelopment and hence, once identified, would supply most of the\nfactors needed to make human embryonic stem cells differentiate\ninto any desired cell type.\n\n   Haseltine said he was discussing a collaboration with Geron.\n\n   Haseltine was well known in the academic world before he left\nthe Harvard Medical School for Human Genome Sciences. But the\ncompany has not published its findings in scientific journals and\nfew if any scientists independent of the company have detailed\nknowledge of its work. Academic scientists consulted about the\ncompany's claims were unable to verify them.\n\n   Human Genome Sciences has filed many patent applications on the\ngenes it has discovered and so far has been granted patents on 652\ngenes whose function it has identified. The company is building a\nplant near its Rockville headquarters to manufacture three of the\nproteins it has discovered. One, vascular endothelial growth factor\n2 or VEGF2, stimulates growth of new blood and lymph vessels. The\nothers are keratinocyte growth factor 2, which stimulates growth of\nthe skin and mucosal tissue, and myeloproliferation inhibitory\nfactor 1, to be used for protecting the bone marrow cells in\npatients receiving chemotherapy. All three compounds are in\nclinical trials and have not yet been approved for market.\n\n   Haseltine has coined the term ``regenerative medicine'' to\ndescribe his hope for renewing body tissues with the help of the\nnatural signals that control their growth. Understanding the body's\nrepair processes at the genetic level ``should permit us to\nmaintain our bodies in normal function, perhaps perpetually,'' he\nsays.\n\n   Many of the repair signals should be found among the 14,000\nsignal and receptor proteins Human Genome Sciences has isolated,\nHaseltine believes. The set should also contain the factors that\nguide human embryonic stem cells down their various lineages to\nform all the tissues of the body.\n\n   The company has developed a robotic screening system to monitor\nhow cells respond to external signals, and hopes that this will\npinpoint the signals involved in embryonic development.\n\n   Dr. David Greenwood, Geropn's chief financial officer, confirmed\nthe company had been in discussions with Haseltine. ``It's\nreasonable to assume that Human Genome Sciences has generated\ninteresting data, given their efforts in the field,'' he said.\n\n   The world of genes and cells that beckons so brightly may well\nprove harder to conquer than it seems.
