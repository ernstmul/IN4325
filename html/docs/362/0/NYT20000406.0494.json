Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Dr. J. Craig Venter told a congressional committee\nThursday that his company, the Celera Corp., had finished analyzing\nall necessary pieces of human DNA and would assemble the whole\nhuman genome within three to six weeks, far earlier than expected.\n\n   Completion of the human genome will be a milestone in the\nhistory of science and medicine. The genome's 3 billion letters of\nDNA, encoding the 80,000 or so genes needed to make and operate a\nhuman being, are expected to provide the basis for a new generation\nof medical treatments that will attack disease at the level of\ngenes and cells.\n\n   Celera, which jumped into a race with a publicly financed\nconsortium of academic centers 22 months ago, now seems likely to\nachieve a clear victory. Though Venter's claims have been\nchallenged in the past, his successful completion last month of a\npilot project, the fruit fly genome, demonstrated that his approach\nworks and seems at least for the moment to have silenced critics.\n\n   No one challenged his forecast Thursday, which he made in the\npresence of the president's science adviser, Dr. Neal Lane, and a\nleading genome sequencer in the public consortium, Dr. Robert H.\nWaterston of Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n   The public consortium laid much of the technical and\ncomputational basis for decoding the human genome, and made its DNA\nsequences freely available to researchers in public databases. It\nintends by the end of June to complete a ``rough draft'' of the\nhuman genome, a set of DNA fragments that will contain about 90\npercent of all human genes.\n\n   Although assembling this material could take until 2003, the\nrough draft will be a significant prize for researchers, since they\nwill be able to search the genome for genes reasonably well even\nthough it is in pieces. Celera is making use of the consortium's\npublic data in completing its own genome sequence.\n\n   Over the last three weeks, as they have entered the endgame of\nthe human genome race, Celera and the consortium have engaged in a\nseries of combative public announcements, interlaced with private\ntalks about collaboration. There is a strong logic for a joint\neffort because the two sides are pursuing different but\ncomplementary strategies to decoding the genome.\n\n   First Celera disclosed its fruit fly results, proving the\neffectiveness of its whole genome shotgun strategy. Then Dr.\nFrancis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project of the National\nInstitutes of Health, announced the June date for the consortium's\nrough draft.\n\n   Venter responded with Thursday's announcement. He added that he\nwas switching his 300 sequencing machines to analysis of the mouse\ngenome, knowledge of which will help researchers interpret what\nhuman genes do.\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)\n\n   The genome decoded by Celera belongs to a man, so it has both X\nand Y chromosomes (women have two X chromosomes). The man has not\nbeen named, but his identify will become largely immaterial as\nindividual variations in DNA, called SNPs or ``snips,'' are\ngathered by Celera and others. The public consortium's genome is\ndrawn from a mosaic of different individuals.\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)\n\n   Venter said that after the human genome was assembled, he would\nconvene a conference of outside experts to annotate it, meaning to\nidentify where the genes lie on the DNA and what they do.\nAnnotation is achieved with computer programs that analyze the DNA\nsequence, pinpoint the components of genes, and guess their\nbiological role from comparison with known genes of other species\nthat are already in the databases.\n\n   Only 3 percent of the human genome codes for genes, and the\nmethods for identifying them are far from perfect. Once the\nannotation experts have finished their task, sometime later this\nyear, Celera will make its human genome sequence freely available\nto researchers, Venter said.\n\n   Venter has a record of technical and managerial successes in\nsequencing genomes, first of bacteria and now of animals, despite\nassertions by critics that he would never succeed and whose\nskepticism seems a necessary psychological spur to his\naccomplishments.\n\n   Sources close to Celera said that at a meeting last Friday with\nofficials of the National Institutes of Health, Venter proposed\nthat both sides publish their findings jointly, as was done with\nthe fruit fly genome sequence, to which the public consortium\ncontributed.\n\n   Draft language of an unpublished Celera-consortium agreement\nstates that their goals ``are, in fact, complementary'' and that\nthe two sides are agreed on patent policy for the human genome\n(essentially that genes should be patentable only after their roles\nhave been identified in detail, not on the basis of their sequence\nalone).\n\n   But Venter's testimony Thursday, before the energy and\nenvironment subcommittee of the House Committee on Science,\nincluded a sharp attack on the quality of the consortium's work and\ncriticism of the ``rough draft'' plan that Collins announced last\nmonth.\n\n   Venter described the consortium's human genome data as ``an\nunordered collection of over 500,000 fragments'' that is ``nowhere\nclose to being done,'' as Collins had been quoted as saying.\n\n   ``Two years ago it was reported that Dr. Collins had said Celera\nwould produce the Mad Magazine version of the human genome,''\nVenter said in his written testimony Thursday. ``From its\nformation, Celera's goal has been to produce a high-quality human\ngenome sequence that will stand the test of time.''\n\n   Sources close to Celera said officials of the national\ninstitutes who saw the testimony earlier this week cited it as a\n``deal breaker'' and cut off negotiations.\n\n   But the real reason for the breakdown, these sources say, was\nnot the testimony but a disagreement over acceptable standards for\ncompleting the human genome sequence.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The definition is in question because unlike bacteria, in which\nevery letter of the genome can be sequenced, animal genomes have\nlarge regions of DNA that cannot be decoded by present methods.\nFortunately, the regions contain few genes. But even the regions\nrelatively abundant in genes have gaps whose decoding will have to\nwait.\n\n   Celera argues that in a finished genome the coding regions\nshould be substantially complete and the order of all the fragments\non the chromosomes should be known. By this definition, Celera's\nfruit fly and presumably human sequences would pass as complete,\nbut the institutes' ``rough draft'' would not. The many fragments\nin its draft can be assigned approximate positions on the\nchromosomes but cannot yet be placed in correct relative order.\n\n   Still, scientists in both camps told the subcommittee Thursday\nthat they agreed on the standards the Patent and Trademark Office\nshould adopt for the patenting of genes. They criticized the\napproach followed by two other genomic companies, Incyte\nPharmaceuticals and Human Genome Sciences, which they contended\nwere downloading the public consortium's genome data every night\nand filing patent applications for any genes they found.\n\n   Genes should not be patentable until a clear description of\ntheir role and utility can be given, the two sides said.\n\n   Venter said Celera's business plan was to offer subscriptions to\nits genomic data for pharmaceutical companies and universities. He\nsaid the fee for universities would be set very low, at $5,000 to\n$15,000 a year.\n\n   In response to a question, Venter said several universities had\ntold him they feared their grants would be cut if they subscribed\nto Celera's database because it was viewed as competitive to\nGenbank, the database run by the institutes.\n\n   Lane said he would look into the accusations and ``ensure that\nall of our agencies are abiding by their rules and guidelines.''\n\n   The hearing took place against the recovery leg of a dramatic\nseesaw in Celera's stock price. Three weeks ago, Celera's stock\nprice was halved, in a $30 billion rout of the biotechnology\nindustry, after an announcement by President Clinton and Britain's\nprime minister, Tony Blair, that had been orchestrated by the\nconsortium.\n\n   The announcement was viewed, at least by Venter, as a criticism\nof Celera and was misinterpreted by others as meaning the White\nHouse opposed granting patents on the human genome. The White House\nsaid at the time, and Clinton reiterated on Wednesday, that no\nchange in patent policy was intended.\n\n   Shares of PE Celera Genomics rose 23.9 percent in trading on the\nNew York Stock Exchange Thursday, closing at $140, a rise of $27.\nOn Wednesday, the stock rose 55 percent.\n\n   Other biotechnology stocks, including Millennium\nPharmaceuticals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Genome Therapeutics,\nwere also sharply higher Thursday as investors saw Celera's\nannouncement as a sign that the industry was progressing faster\nthan previously thought.\n\n   The Nasdaq biotechnology index surged 4.9 percent, helping the\noverall Nasdaq market recover from its selloff earlier in the week\nby another 2.36 percent.\n\n   The business fallout of the Clinton-Blair announcement served to\npoliticize Thursday's hearings, with Republican members asking\nquestions critical of the consortium and Democrats seeking to bring\nout the public benefit of the consortium's efforts.\n\n   Asked if publication of the human genome sequence would allow\nhostile governments to devise biological weapons or target specific\npopulations, Venter said that ``the genome will not provide the\nability for targeting any ethnic groups'' and that any dangerous\nknowledge was more likely to lie in the genomes of pathogenic\nbacteria.\n\n   Rep.
