Interpol\nestimates illegal wildlife trafficking worldwide at $6 billion\nannually.\n\n   An 82-page indictment charges a 40-year-old Malaysian man, Ken\nLiang ``Anson'' Wong, with being the leader of the ring.

The latter is charged with helping smuggle rare animals as a\npart of the ring.\n\n   A fourth suspect, Hong Kong animal dealer Yuk Wah Shiu, 39,\nremained at large.\n\n   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Webb said Wong will be extradited\nfrom Mexico for trial in the U.S. as soon as possible.\n\n   Burroughs appeared briefly in U.S. District Court in San\nFrancisco Tuesday, but he did not enter a plea to the charges. He\nwill appear in court Friday for a bail hearing.\n\n   Federal agents said Burroughs was directly involved with\nsmuggling such endangered animals as star tortoises, crocodiles\nfrom India, Chinese alligators and Komodo dragons into the United\nStates on behalf of Wong's group.\n\n   Burroughs continued to move the rare animals into the country as\nrecently as last month, the indictment said.\n\n   The indictment charges the three men with 55 violations of\nfederal law, including conspiracy, smuggling, money laundering,\nfalsification of federal statements and breaking wildlife laws.\n\n   If convicted, the suspects could face up to five years in\nfederal prison for each of the smuggling, conspiracy and false\nstatement charges.
