The five, apparently under the influence of\nalcohol, had been pulled over and asked to show their\nidentification.\n\n   Instead, they sped away, shooting policeman Ayman Ashouqiya in\nthe stomach and spine as they fled.\n\n   The incident, say Palestinians, is not isolated.\n\n   More than five years after the Palestinian Authority first set\nfoot in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho in August 1994, a\nhalf dozen rival police organizations still operate in a legal\nvacuum.\n\n   The result, say critics, has been a string of accidental\nkillings committed by police misusing their weapons and a thriving\nblack gun market allegedly run by members of the security forces.\nSince the beginning of the year, 12 Palestinians have died in\naccidents at the hands of police. Scuffles between various police\nfactions are all too common.\n\n   ``Every day and everywhere,'' said Hosam Khader, an outspoken\nmember of the Palestinian Legislative Council, or parliament, who\nhas pushed for years for police reforms.\n\n   ``The problem is we don't have law,'' Khader said. ``Every\nsecurity branch works according to his (own) laws and by himself.\nAnd every security branch thinks he's the owner of the area.''\n\n   Until now, Arafat has done little to address the problem,\npreferring to maintain rival security forces with nothing in common\nexcept allegiance to him, human rights organizations allege.\nAttempts by some members of parliament to exact laws to curb police\nabuses and provide structure to the various security forces have\nbeen ignored.\n\n   The absence of law has been a constant concern among\nPalestinians since the first signs of lawlessness appeared shortly\nafter the self-rule government was set up. But several incidents in\nthe past few weeks have created a new sense of urgency.\n\n   On Sept. 15, undercover police stormed the offices of Maher\nDasuki, a popular Palestinian television talk-show host, arrested\nhim on charges of ``incitement'' and tortured him for 15 days\nbefore releasing him without trial.\n\n   A few days later, the military prosecutor in Nablus ordered the\narrest of 30 men, many from various security branches, on suspicion\nof selling weapons after a butcher in Nablus was shot in the legs\nby masked gunmen.\n\n   Next came the incident in which Ashouqiya, the Ramallah\npoliceman, was shot in the stomach and survived to point a finger\nat members of Force 17.\n\n   Police leaders say they need time to organize and train their\nmen. Under constant pressure to safeguard Israel's security, they\npoint to successes in that realm _ such as the recent capture of\ntwo wanted Islamic Jihad men who had escaped from a Palestinian\nprison _ to buttress criticisms of their domestic performance.\n\n   ``Why doesn't anyone mention that?'' asked Col. Samih Kanaan,\ndeputy head of the Preventive Security in the West Bank. ``We admit\nthere are mistakes.\n\n   ``We are still in the beginning,'' Kanaan added. ``The laws and\nregulations (governing the police) are still not approved yet.''\n\n   After 30 years of Israeli occupation and eight years of\n``intifada,'' the violent uprising against Israeli rule,\nPalestinian young men have been conditioned to lawlessness and\nvigilantism, Kanaan said. Police trainers have had to try slowly to\nchange these attitudes.\n\n   As head of the Preventive Security in Nablus, Kanaan said, he\nonce sent his men out to make an arrest, only to discover that they\nhad put on masks and climbed in through a window of the suspect's\nhouse, in typical intifada style.\n\n   ``It takes time to change this mentality,'' he said.\n\n   Palestinian human rights workers scoff at pleas by the security\nforces that they need time to train. The real problem, they say,\nlies with a Palestinian government that has so far refused to act\nto curb weapons abuse.\n\n   ``They are not taking any serious measures to reduce misuse,''\nsaid Khader Shkirat, a lawyer who directs the Palestinian Society\nfor the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment.\n\n   ``They are simply not addressing it,'' he said. ``There's no\npolitical will.''\n\n   It took a feud between rival clans in Nablus to find some\npolitical will.\n\n   The feud began Sept. 15, when activists from the Balata refugee\ncamp near Nablus belonging to Arafat's mainstream Fatah party\nattended a wedding and were accused of harassing female guests. A\nfistfight ensued between the Balata boys and members of the Abu\nSulhiehs, a prominent merchant family from the city.\n\n   The next day, three masked men from Balata sprayed semiautomatic\nweapons fire at a butcher shop owned by the Abu Sulhieh family,\ninjuring Bashar Abu Sulhieh in the legs. Abu Sulhieh family\nmembers, also Fatah members, then took to the streets in a show of\nforce, intimidating people with guns and forcing shops to close.\n\n   With a gun problem out of control, Palestinian officials quietly\nsay, Arafat was forced to act. The military prosecutor and the\nmayor, Ghassan Shakaa, ordered the arrest of several Balata camp\nleaders and accused them of selling weapons. Most of those arrested\nbelonged to one of the security branches.\n\n   The incident prompted Arafat finally to do what peace agreements\nwith Israel require, namely to confiscate illegal weapons. Security\nforces deployed in the camp seized unregistered guns during a broad\nsweep.\n\n   But they admit few illegal weapons were found.\n\n   Until the incident happened, buying weapons on the black market\nin Nablus was easy. Sellers openly sold pistols and assault rifles\nin the narrow alleyways of the casbah, smuggled in from Egypt and\nJordan or purchased from Israeli criminals. Prices ranged from $500\nfor a small pistol to $3,500 for a Kalashnikov.\n\n   Khader, the parliament member, alleges much of the smuggling was\nbeing done by security men and other VIPs, who are issued permits\nby Israel that allow them to travel more freely and with less\nstringent security checks than ordinary Palestinians.\n\n   ``You can pass through Israeli checkpoints in your Range Rover\nor your Peugeot and the Israelis cover their eyes,'' Khader said.\n``Those who have VIP (cards) can bring guns, gold and even drugs.''\n\n   Without laws governing the functions of the different security\nbranches, some Palestinians worry there will always be police\nrivalries that lead to violence.\n\n   And smuggling, which was driven temporarily underground by the\nNablus incident, is quietly thriving. Allegedly in the hands of\nsome political heavyweights, finding prolonged political will to\nstop it may prove difficult, Palestinians say.\n\n   ``It's too late,'' said Khader. ``The Authority should register\nall the weapons. They should be strong with the dealers. But they\nwon't.
