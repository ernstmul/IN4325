SENNOTT  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian suspect captured minutes after he\nallegedly tossed two grenades into a crowded bus station reportedly\nmet three times with Israeli secret service officials during the\nweeks in which he carried out other attacks against Israelis.\n\n   Israel's leading newspaper, Ha'aretz, Wednesday quoted sources\nfrom Israel's secret service, Shin Bet, and top Palestinian\nsecurity officials saying that Israeli agents had tried to recruit\nthe suspect, Salam Rajab Sarsour, in a meeting in August and two\nmeetings last month.\n\n   The report added that Sarsour, 29, confessed to Israeli\nauthorities that he had also carried out other attacks in the\nHebron area, including the August murder of a rabbi from a Jewish\nsettlement and throwing grenades at Israeli soldiers earlier this\nmonth.\n\n   This would mean that while Israeli Shin Bet agents were meeting\nwith Sarsour, and even reportedly providing him with the money for\na mobile phone, he was planning and perhaps even carrying out the\nwave of attacks.\n\n   The unnamed sources said they were unaware of his terrorist\nactivities until he was apprehended after Tuesday's attack, which\nwounded 64 people, including Israeli civilians and soldiers.\n\n   Palestinian Authority Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub\nsays Sarsour was a ``double agent'' who foiled the Israeli agents\nwho had recruited him while simultaneously being inducted into the\narmed wing of the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n\n   Rajoub maintained that these revelations prove the Israelis\ncould have stopped the attack. It is bitterly ironic, he added, in\nlight of the way Israel _ within minutes after the attack _ blamed\nPalestinian officials for doing too little to fight terrorism.\n\n   In the Mideast peace summit in Maryland, Israeli Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu seized on the Tuesday attack by immediately\nlimiting talks to Israeli security and using the attack as an\nexample of how the Palestinian Authority needs to step up its fight\nagainst extremists from Hamas.\n\n   The director of the Israeli Government Press Office, Moshe\nFogel, refused to confirm or deny the Ha'aretz report.\n\n   For Palestinian negotiators in Maryland, the news reports\nunderscore their claim that no nation in the world can completely\nstop terrorism. They point out that 20 Hamas activists have been\ndetained for questioning in their efforts to help the Israelis\nprosecute the suspect in the attack. They maintain that the\nIsraelis are ratcheting up security demands as a way to derail a\nprocess that has been deadlocked for 19 months.\n\n   Fogel dismissed that claim, saying, ``We are not asking them to\ndo anything less than to help stop terrorism. We want them to do\nwhat we would do. They have 35,000 people in their police force and\nhave every reason to be more effective in breaking the\ninfrastructure of terrorism.''\n","Headline":"\nGRENADE-THROWING SUSPECT, ISRAELI SECURITY REPORTEDLY CONFERRED\n","Text":["\n   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian suspect captured minutes after he\nallegedly tossed two grenades into a crowded bus station reportedly\nmet three times with Israeli secret service officials during the\nweeks in which he carried out other attacks against Israelis.\n","\n   Israel's leading newspaper, Ha'aretz, Wednesday quoted sources\nfrom Israel's secret service, Shin Bet, and top Palestinian\nsecurity officials saying that Israeli agents had tried to recruit\nthe suspect, Salam Rajab Sarsour, in a meeting in August and two\nmeetings last month.\n","\n   The report added that Sarsour, 29, confessed to Israeli\nauthorities that he had also carried out other attacks in the\nHebron area, including the August murder of a rabbi from a Jewish\nsettlement and throwing grenades at Israeli soldiers earlier this\nmonth.\n","\n   This would mean that while Israeli Shin Bet agents were meeting\nwith Sarsour, and even reportedly providing him with the money for\na mobile phone, he was planning and perhaps even carrying out the\nwave of attacks.\n","\n   The unnamed sources said they were unaware of his terrorist\nactivities until he was apprehended after Tuesday's attack, which\nwounded 64 people, including Israeli civilians and soldiers.\n","\n   Palestinian Authority Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub\nsays Sarsour was a ``double agent'' who foiled the Israeli agents\nwho had recruited him while simultaneously being inducted into the\narmed wing of the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n","\n   Rajoub maintained that these revelations prove the Israelis\ncould have stopped the attack.
