Times News Service   \n\n   In the Greek myths, a terrible price is always paid by humans\nwho seek to live forever, as if to discourage people from even the\nthought of sharing in the defining attribute of gods. Tithonus, a\nyouth with whom Aurora, the goddess of the Dawn, fell in love, was\ngranted immortality, but as he grew more bent and decrepit longed\nonly for one other gift, the relief of death.\n\n   Chastened by such cautionary tales, we meekly accept that death\nis as inevitable as the dawn, knowing that our bodies will run down\nlike an aging automobile when they exceed their design limit. So it\nwas almost disquieting rather than uplifting to hear scientists at\nGeron Corp. in Menlo Park, Calif., talk about ``immortalizing''\ncertain cells that they hoped to derive from the recently isolated\nhuman embryonic stem cells. Surely the scientists were speaking\nmetaphorically.\n\n   They were not.\n\n   The study of aging is undergoing a possibly profound change, and\na handful of biologists, whose hubris has not yet been punished\nwith a thunderbolt from Mount Olympus, are beginning to think about\ninterfering with the mechanisms that make the body mortal.\n\n   Immortalizing a cell is of course very different from making an\nindividual live forever. But because people are made of cells the\ntwo concepts have a deep and maybe exploitable link.\n\n   For decades biologists have known that the body's mortality is\nmirrored on the cellular level by an immutable rule called the\nHayflick limit. Dr. Leonard Hayflick, now of the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, discovered that when tissue cells are\ntaken from the body and cultured in a laboratory dish, they grow\nand divide about 50 times _ the number varies with the kind of\ntissue _ and then lapse into senescence.\n\n   In January, Geron's biologists announced an electrifying\nfinding: They had learned how to make human cells break the\nHayflick limit. The physical basis of the Hayflick rule is a\nsection of DNA known as the telomere, which gets shorter each time\nthe cell divides. When the telomeres reach a certain minimum\nlength, the cell is thrown into a terminal crisis.\n\n   All cells possess a gene, known as the telomerase gene, which\ncan restore the telomeres to their youthful length. But in most\ncells the gene is permanently repressed and inactive. Geron's\ndiscovery was that by inserting a copy of the telomerase gene in\nactive form into cells, it could make them grow and divide\nindefinitely.\n\n   For cells, the ability to divide indefinitely into two identical\ndaughter cells is immortality. (The cell's atoms and molecules are\ncontinually being replaced, but its structure and informational\ncontent are unchanged from day to day.) For an individual, making\nclones of oneself in perpetuity would hardly count as living\nforever. What stands between a person and immortality is that\nalmost all the body's cells are mortal and, though they turn over,\neventually cease to replace themselves efficiently.\n\n   Two categories of body cell, however, are immortal in the cell's\nsense of being able to divide indefinitely. One is the essence of\nlife, the other of death. Cancer cells eventually learn how to\nunlock the bolted down switches on the telomerase gene, and with\nthis last defense in their hands can defy all the body's careful\ncontrol mechanisms and run rampant.\n\n   The other kind of immortal cell is the all-purpose, embryonic\nstem cells from which the whole organism develops. In embryonic\nstem cells, too, the telomerase gene is active, and the cells can\ndivide indefinitely as long as they remain embryonic. As the fetus\ndevelops, however, the embryonic stem cells differentiate, meaning\nthat they progress down a variety of different pathways to become\nthe specialized cells that form each of the body's different\ntissues.\n\n   In the biologist's view it is differentiation, not expulsion\nfrom Eden, that makes us mortal. As cells differentiate, they\nrepress the telomerase gene. Some, like most brain and heart cells,\nseem never to divide again once the organism has reached maturity.\nOthers, like skin and blood cells, can regenerate from stem cells\nspecific to their tissue, but these tissue stem cells, descendants\nof the embryonic stem cells, also have a finite lifetime.\n\n   How then are embryonic cells generated from parents whose cells\nare irreversibly differentiated? In the embryo, a small number of\nstem cells are set aside, before embryonic development begins, and\nprotected from differentiation. These special cells, known as\nembryonic germ cells, migrate to the developing ovary or testis,\nwhere they generate the egg or sperm for the next generation.\n\n   Thus there is a special lineage of cells that permanently resist\nterminal differentiation, cycling indefinitely from embryonic stem\ncell to embryonic germ cell, to oocyte or sperm, to fertilized egg\nand embryonic stem cell again. At each cycle the cells spin off a\nnew body as the temporary vehicle to carry them forward on their\nunending journey.\n\n   Geron's second amazing advance of the year was the isolation of\nhuman embryonic stem cells by two groups of researchers whom the\ncompany financed. One reason for its success was that under its\nvisionary founder, Michael West, the company worked with leading\nacademic scientists in the telomere field. Because the embryonic\nstem cells were known to maintain permanently youthful telomeres,\nthe company was drawn into the stem cell field and repeated the\ncoup of signing up many of the leading university scientists in the\nfield.\n\n   With its human embryonic stem cells and its telomerase gene,\nGeron has acquired two scientifically fascinating properties,\nthough of course commercial pay-off may be years away. What the\ncompany hopes to do is to guide the embryonic stem cells down\nspecific paths of differentiation toward becoming the specialized\ncells of heart, blood or any other desired tissue.\n\n   nn\n\n   Before being injected into a patient, these specialized cells\ncould be immortalized by adding the telomerase gene in active form.\nThe tissues they formed in a patient would then be permanently\nyouthful. (There would of course be a problem of immune rejection,\nwhich Geron has not yet addressed. West, now at another company,\nsaid last week that he hoped to sidestep rejection by generating\nembryonic stem cells from the patient's own body cells; their\ndifferentiated state would be reversed by fusing the cell with a\ncow's egg.)\n\n   If biologists can immortalize some of the body's cells by the\nGeron method, could they in time learn how to immortalize them all?\nDr. William Haseltine, chairman of Human Genome Sciences in\nRockville, Md., believes a solution lies with the tissue stem cells\nthat provide for the regeneration of tissue like blood and skin.\nTissue stem cells, descendants of the embryonic stem cells, may\nexist for many or all tissues but only a few have so far been\nidentified.\n\n   These tissue stem cells also get old in time and start to\ngenerate tired or compromised cells. Haseltine's idea is to replace\nthem, before they start to do harm, with tissue stem cells\nimmortalized with telomerase. All the body's tissues would thus be\ncontinuously and reliably regenerated from permanently youthful\ntissue stem cells.\n\n   ``This is a clearly articulated vision of human immortality that\nwill be introduced slowly over the next 50 years,'' Haseltine said.\n\n   Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice president for research,\ncommented sternly that his own company had no such plans.\n\n   Making the body immortal ``is indeed fanciful and certainly\nsomething we don't even contemplate here,'' he said. ``We are much\nmore interested in dealing with the 20 or so degenerative diseases\nthat have no present treatment and could be addressed with\nimmortalized cells.''\n\n   The embryonic stem cells, immortal seeds in our mortal bodies,\nhave a pedigree that stretches back more than 3 billion years to\nthe first cell.
