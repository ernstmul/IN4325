Times News Service   \n\n   The 10-year project to decode the human genome is entering its\nend game, but the high goal of unlocking the secrets of human\nheredity is ending in a fractious exchange of claims and\ncountercharges.\n\n   Within a few weeks, both contestants in the genome race plan to\ndeclare victory, but in different terms, each already judged\nimperfect by the rival team.\n\n   The genome is an instruction manual containing the 100,000 or so\ngenes that govern human development, operation and maintenance.\nDefects in various of these genes cause or contribute to almost all\nhuman disease.\n\n   At stake is academic glory for the genome researchers, an\neventual gold mine for the companies that are first to develop\nuseful drugs from the genomic information, and a landmark in\nscientific history as the foundation for human self-knowledge is\nput in place.\n\n   One contestant is a consortium of largely U.S. and British\nacademic centers supported by the National Institutes of Health and\nthe Wellcome Trust of London. The other is Celera Corp., an upstart\nwhose formation just two years ago turned the centers' unchallenged\npursuit of the genome into a furious race.\n\n   Since then, each side has made remarkable progress. The\nconsortium, despite its unwieldy organization, responded to the\nCelera challenge, scrapped its target date of 2005 and focused on\nproviding a rough but usable human genome sequence as early as\npossible. Its rough draft _ some 90 percent to 95 percent of the\ngenome including most of the genes _ may be ready as early as June.\n\n   Washington expects to have invested more than $3 billion by the\ntime the project is complete and Celera about half a billion\ndollars.\n\n   Celera, whose name is the female form of the Latin word meaning\n``quick,'' has indeed been strikingly nimble. In just two years it\nhas built a plant with 300 DNA sequencing machines, decoded the\ngenome of the fruit fly _ a widely studied laboratory organism _ as\na pilot project and, according to its president, Dr. J. Craig\nVenter, is within a few weeks of decoding almost the entire human\ngenome.\n\n   Although the two sides have discussed collaborating on a joint\npublication, talks broke down in December amid charges of\n``antagonism and excessive competition'' made by Dr. Francis\nCollins, head of the National Institutes of Health unit of the\nHuman Genome Project, in a letter to Venter and other Celera\nofficials.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   In any agreement, Collins wrote, referring to what he evidently\nconsidered past lapses by the Celera side, there would have to be\n``honest and straightforward responses to scientific inquiries, but\navoiding disparaging the other party, sowing discord or undermining\nthe collaborative spirit.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The intense pace of competition has been heightened by personal\nand institutional factors. Venter's ideas for decoding genomes have\nseveral times been dismissed as unworkable by the consortium's\nleading experts, and he has not hidden his satisfaction in proving\nhe was right. His overall strategy for decoding the human genome,\ncalled a whole genome shotgun, was considered and rejected by the\nconsortium, but in Celera's hands it has worked, at least with the\nfruit fly.\n\n   Consortium scientists say Venter has unfair advantages, notably\nin that Celera can use all the genome data that the consortium\nmakes publicly available through GenBank, the government's computer\ndata base for genome information.\n\n   In its public statements, the consortium, which seems to have\nchosen a workable but less efficient decoding strategy than\nVenter's, has aimed to seize the high ground on the issue of data\nrelease. Though scientists usually harvest the first fruits of\ntheir findings themselves, the consortium's centers publish their\ngenome data immediately on the GenBank data base, where it is free\nfor any use.\n\n   On March 14, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair\nwere persuaded to issue a statement saying the genome ``should be\nmade freely available to scientists everywhere.'' The two leaders\npraised the consortium's data release policy and, at least in\nVenter's view, indirectly criticized Celera. The statement\ninadvertently devastated biotechnology stocks, including Celera's,\nwhen it was misinterpreted by the markets as meaning the two\ngovernments would oppose patenting human genomic data.\n\n   Celera has said it will make its human genome sequence available\non a DVD disk, with no control over any discoveries that other\nscientists may derive from the information. But the company has\nrefused to deposit its data in GenBank without safeguards to\nprevent its commercial rivals, such as Incyte and Human Genome\nSciences, from downloading the data and selling it as their own.\n\n   Although the consortium wants everyone to use its data, that\nresolve is less intense when the user is Celera. Collins has said\nit would be ``a breach of scientific ethics'' for Celera to include\nthe consortium's data in its article describing the human genome.\n\n   nn\n\n   This charge has not resonated well. ``I strongly disagree with\nthat,'' said Dr. David Lipman, director of the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information, which runs GenBank. ``These groups\nunderstood when they deposited their data that the whole goal was\nto make it available without restrictions immediately.''\n\n   But Lipman supports another position being taken by the\nconsortium, that journal editors should refuse to accept Celera's\narticle on its human genome sequence until the company has first\ndeposited its data in GenBank. Genome sequences are mind-numbing\nrows of A's, T's, C's and G's that would take hundreds of pages if\nprinted in full. Many journal editors require authors of genome\narticles to deposit the sequence in GenBank's computers as a\ncondition of publication.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Lipman said GenBank did not have the resources to accommodate\nCelera's request that its data, if deposited in GenBank, should\nreceive legal protection from copying by its commercial rivals.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The two teams are negotiating with rival journals to publish\ntheir descriptions of the genome _ the consortium with Nature of\nLondon, Celera with Science of Washington.\n\n   Despite the customary scientific practice of waiting for\npublication until announcing a new discovery, the two sides are\nlikely to issue claims of success well before their articles appear\nin print. To pre-empt Celera's article in Science, the consortium\nmay hope to enlist Clinton and Blair again in an announcement,\nperhaps early next month, that it has achieved its rough draft of\nthe human genome.\n\n   To pre-empt the consortium's declaration of victory, Venter may\nmake it known, perhaps this week, that he has successfully\nassembled the human genome, the final stage in decoding and in\nprinciple a large step ahead of the rough draft stage reached by\nthe consortium.\n\n   Both sides have already found fault with the other's victory\nplans.\n\n   The consortium's data is in a mixture of states. Though some\nregions of the 3 billion-unit human genome, like the short\nchromosome 22, are essentially complete, much of the rest is in the\nform of millions of short pieces of DNA, most of them about 10,000\nunits of DNA in length. Although the consortium knows roughly where\neach piece should go on its parent chromosome, it does not know\nexactly enough to place all the pieces in correct order.\n\n   Venter has said that anything worthy of being called a human\ngenome sequence needs to be arranged in correct order, which the\nconsortium's rough draft is not.\n\n   If Venter's whole genome shotgun approach works as well with the\nhuman genome as it did with the fruit fly, Celera's version of the\ngenome will all be in correct order.\n\n   Celera's genome is likely, however, to have lots of gaps. The\ngaps in its fruit fly genome sequence were mostly small holes of\nknown length and position that could be filled in later and were of\nminor significance. But Dr. Robert Waterston, head of the\nsequencing center at Washington University, St. Louis, a leading\ncomponent of the consortium, has calculated that there could be\n100,000 gaps in Celera's human genome sequence, with an especially\nlarge number in regions where Celera has no consortium data to rely\non.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Even though the consortium's rough draft will not be completely\nordered and will contain many gaps, it will nonetheless be of great\nvalue to researchers. Most of the genes are contained within the\ndecoded regions and can be fished out by computer search programs,\nLipman said.\n\n   With Celera's fully assembled genome, it will be possible both\nto search for genes and to compare the human genome with other\ngenomes, an important step in understanding how the human genome\nworks.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   In the battle of rival claims, one certain winner will be the\npublic. Because of the competition, the human genome sequence and\nall the benefits expected to flow from it will be available to\nresearchers and pharmaceutical companies more than four years ahead\nof the original target date of 2005.\n\n   ``I think they both represent remarkable achievements,'' said\nDr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences.\n","Headline":"\nRIVALS ON OFFENSIVE AS THEY NEAR WIRE IN GENOME RACE \n","Text":["\n   The 10-year project to decode the human genome is entering its\nend game, but the high goal of unlocking the secrets of human\nheredity is ending in a fractious exchange of claims and\ncountercharges.\n","\n   Within a few weeks, both contestants in the genome race plan to\ndeclare victory, but in different terms, each already judged\nimperfect by the rival team.\n","\n   The genome is an instruction manual containing the 100,000 or so\ngenes that govern human development, operation and maintenance.\nDefects in various of these genes cause or contribute to almost all\nhuman disease.\n","\n   At stake is academic glory for the genome researchers, an\neventual gold mine for the companies that are first to develop\nuseful drugs from the genomic information, and a landmark in\nscientific history as the foundation for human self-knowledge is\nput in place.\n","\n   One contestant is a consortium of largely U.S. and British\nacademic centers supported by the National Institutes of Health and\nthe Wellcome Trust of London.
