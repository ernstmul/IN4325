HOCKADAY  \n c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  \n\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A national but virtually unknown\norganization, based in Kansas City for half a century, observed its\n50th anniversary with a dinner Thursday (June 18) at the\nMarriott-Muehlebach Tower.\n\n   Leaders and staff members of nonprofit agencies from Kansas City\nand throughout the United States attended the event for American\nHumanics. Many guests, representing Boy Scouts of America, the\nAmerican Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity International and other\nnational human service organizations, had studied American Humanics\nas college undergraduates.\n\n   They had learned how to earn a living in the nonprofit world:\nHow to budget, raise funds, work with volunteers. Armed with an\nAmerican Humanics certificate, they had moved immediately into\nmanagement positions with nonprofit agencies.\n\n   For David J. Ross II, scout executive of the Heart of America\nCouncil of Boy Scouts, his American Humanics classes led to a\nlifetime career and marriage. He and his wife, Jane Fey Ross, met\nin classes at Missouri Valley College in Marshall.\n\n   Today Ross is responsible for a $6 million annual budget for the\nHeart of America Council that serves 51,000 youths from 7 to 21\nyears old in 19 counties in Missouri and Kansas, has 38 full-time\nstaff members and 16,000 adult volunteer mentors.\n\n   ``Seven of our staff members have American Humanics\ncertificates,'' he said.\n\n   Living in a virtual cocoon for most of its life, American\nHumanics, with headquarters at 4601 Madison Ave., is now coming\ninto its own. It is called on for young talent by human service\norganizations across the country, offering assistance in everything\nfrom housing to recreation. Backed by corporate foundations instead\nof federal dollars, nonprofit agencies are mushrooming and the\ndemand for qualified staff to run them is exploding.\n\n   ``Our program is currently taught on 54 campuses, but by 2001 we\nhope to be on 100 campuses,'' said American Humanics President Kirk\nAlliman. ``The unique thing about the program is that it is the\nonly one of its kind offered to undergraduates. Nearly 70\nuniversities offer nonprofit management education for graduate\nstudents.''\n\n   Father of American Humanics\n\n   The late H. Roe Bartle, best remembered as Kansas City's mayor\nfrom 1955 to 1963, is the father of American Humanics. In Kansas\nCity to represent him at the anniversary was his daughter,\n``Jimmy'' Bartle Taylor of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n   For 27 years Bartle led the Greater Kansas City Area (now the\nHeart of America) Council of Boy Scouts. As executive director, he\nwas responsible for hiring qualified staff members. He had no\ntrouble finding people with good hearts and intentions, but many\nknew nothing about running an organization.\n\n   What they had was ``consecrated ignorance,'' said Bartle, known\nfor his way with words. A big man with a big voice to back his\nideas, he came up with a solution to the problem.\n\n   With the help of longtime civic leader Jerry Cohen and others,\nBartle founded American Humanics Inc. in Kansas City in 1948. His\nidea was to teach college undergraduates the business side of\nrunning nonprofit agencies. Courses would be conducted on campus,\nand experienced agency executives would present classroom lectures\nand workshops. Students would volunteer in community agencies,\nlearning from on-the-job experience. At graduation, they would have\nthe management skills to run nonprofit agencies from the top.\n\n   Bartle's idea _ in force since its inception _ was ahead of its\ntime. Fifty years ago, most college campuses were not interested in\nadding American Humanics courses to their curriculums. Veterans\nreturning from World War II were completing their education on the\nGI Bill and considering careers in the for-profit, not the\nnonprofit, field. So American Humanics began and grew within a\nsmall network of colleges. That picture has changed dramatically in\nrecent years.\n\n   ``The program may be the least known of the legacy of H. Roe\nBartle but the most far-reaching, with 2,700 alumni today,'' said\nNorman E. Swails of Lee's Summit, retired presiding bishop of the\nReorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with\nheadquarters in Independence.\n\n   Swails took advantage of the American Humanics courses taught at\nMissouri Valley College. After his graduation in 1952, he went to\nwork for the Boy Scouts. When he retired 31 years later, he was\nassistant chief scout executive//national director of finance. One\nof his last duties was to successfully complete a $56 million\nfund-raising campaign. In 1985 he came to Independence to direct a\n$60 million building campaign for the new RLDS temple.\n\n   ``I owe my careers in scouting and in the church to American\nHumanics,'' he said. ``The program taught me the principles of\nworking with volunteers and raising money.''\n\n   Spreading the word\n\n   Kirk Alliman was president of Hesston College, north of Wichita,\nKan., when he was tapped to be president of American Humanics in\n1992. His mission: To spread American Humanics to college campuses\nacross the country. The program had managed to infiltrate only 12\ncolleges since 1948.\n\n   Alliman hired a dynamic director of campus expansion. Phyllis A.\nWallace had been national associate director for the YMCA in\nChicago for 10 years. Since joining American Humanics in 1995,\nWallace has expanded the program from 12 to 54 campuses. About 900\nstudents are enrolled today, but Alliman and Wallace want to have\n5,000 enrolled on 100 campuses by 2001.\n\n   Funding for the expansion has come from a $2.4 million grant\nfrom the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, based in Battle Creek, Mich., and\na $250,000 gift from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.\n\n   ``I have focused on minority college campuses,'' Wallace said,\n``because nonprofits are crying out for minority staff _ for\nAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and Native Americans.\nAnd they are desperately wanting men. Traditionally more women have\ngone into the nonprofit field. It is possible now to enter the\nnonprofit sector with the idea of not only doing good for others,\nbut earning a starting salary of $25,000 to $30,000. In Kansas\nCity, there are more than 200 job opportunities available\nannually.''\n\n   American Humanics courses are offered only on four-year college\ncampuses, Wallace said, because a bachelor's degree is required for\nanyone receiving a humanics certificate. The latter represents 180\nhours of course work and 300 hours of internship _ on-site\nvolunteer work with a community agency.\n\n   Rockhurst College is the only area metropolitan campus offering\nAmerican Humanics courses. Jenny Rinella, a 1993 graduate with a\nhumanics certificate, is executive director of the program there.\n\n   ``I majored in sociology, but I am particularly talking to\nbusiness students about American Humanics because the combination\nis a good one for starting a career,'' Rinella said.\n\n   Patrick Lozares, a Rockhurst senior majoring in economics, is\ntaking humanics courses with the hope of someday making life better\non the reservation he knew as a child in Meridian, Miss.\n\n   ``I am a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and\nspent my early childhood on the reservation,'' he said. ``People\nthere are poverty-stricken and in poor health. I hope to work with\nthe children.''\n\n   The dozens of American Humanics graduates working in management\nroles in the Kansas City area include:\n\n   - Liz Russell Willman: The first person to serve as executive\ndirector of the 9-year-old Shawnee Mission Education Foundation,\nwhich provides grant money for teachers and principals to fund\ninnovative projects.\n\n   - Marshall Hollingsworth: Director of finance, National Center\non Fathering, based in Merriam.\n\n   - Phil Hanson: Executive vice president, financial resource\ndevelopment, Heart of America United Way.\n\n   - Cyndi Roth Campbell: Director of volunteer recruitment for the\nGreater Kansas City chapter, American Red Cross.\n\n   ``I went to night school to get my American Humanics\ncertificate,'' said Campbell, who handles the records for nearly\n800 volunteers. ``During my internship I volunteered at the Red\nCross. I think one of the great assets of the humanics program is\nthat your instructors are brought into the classroom from the\nnot-for-profit field.\n\n   ``The traditional educational experience tries to simulate the\nreal world. But American Humanics brings the real world into the\nclassroom. When you are turned out into the world, you are ready.''\n","Headline":"\nAMERICAN HUMANICS REAPS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROFIT \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A national but virtually unknown\norganization, based in Kansas City for half a century, observed its\n50th anniversary with a dinner Thursday (June 18) at the\nMarriott-Muehlebach Tower.\n","\n   Leaders and staff members of nonprofit agencies from Kansas City\nand throughout the United States attended the event for American\nHumanics.
