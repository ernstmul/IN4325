By NICHOLAS WADE    \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Struggling to respond to President Clinton's request for\nimmediate advice on the hybrid cow-human cell announced earlier\nthis month, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has\ndelivered a guarded and somewhat tentative reply, based on the few\nfacts available to it.\n\n   The chairman of the commission, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the\npresident of Princeton University, said in a letter to Clinton that\nthe news raised ``concerns about crossing species boundaries and\nexercising excessive control over nature.''\n\n   The proposed use of the hybrid cells to grow human tissues for\ntransplant into a patient would or would not raise new ethical\nissues, depending on the nature of the cells, Shapiro said.\n\n   The cells are obtained by fusing a human skin or blood cell with\na cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed. The cow egg is\nthought to make the nucleus of the human cell revert to the\nembryonic state. The human nucleus then takes over control of the\ncell, displacing most of the cow proteins with human proteins, and\nthe cell divides into a cluster of embryonic stem-like cells,\naccording to Dr. Michael West, president of Advanced Cell\nTechnology, who announced the technique earlier this month.\n\n   As embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into any\ntissue of the body, West's company hopes to grow whatever\nreplacement tissues a patient might need from his or her own cells.\n\n   Shapiro's letter pointed to the ambiguous nature of the cells\napparently created in the technique. If the embryonic cells that\nresult from the human cell-cow egg fusion are capable of developing\ninto a fetus when transferred to a uterus, then they raise the same\n``important ethical concerns'' as any other research on human\nembryos.\n\n   But if the embryonic cells are not capable of developing into an\nembryo, then ``we do not believe that totally new ethical issues\narise,'' Shapiro said. His letter implies that the only issue\nraised in this case would be that of mingling human and animal\ncells, noting that this is done routinely for certain medical\npurposes.\n\n   The ability of the embryonic cells to grow into an infant cannot\nat present be determined. The original experiments were taken only\nto a very preliminary stage, and no scientific tests were performed\non the cells that resulted.\n\n   Other experts said they would need more evidence to know if\nhuman embryonic, stem-like cells had indeed been produced, as the\ncompany asserted, although one expert, Dr. John Gearhart of Johns\nHopkins University, said when shown a photograph of the cells that\nthey could be embryonic stem cells.\n\n   West said previously that his company had no intention of\ntransferring the embryonic cells created in this way to a person's\nwomb and that it would be wrong to do so. Shapiro said the\ncommission also held this view. Thus, it seems unlikely that the\npotential of the cells to become a person will be tested directly.\n\n   In his letter to the commission a week ago, Clinton said he was\n``deeply troubled'' by news of the cow-human hybrid cells. In\ninterviews, several commission members expressed a somewhat lesser\nlevel of alarm while saying they understood the reasons for the\npresident's concerns.\n\n   Dr. Carol Greider, a biologist at Johns Hopkins, said that the\nthought that someone might transfer to a uterus the embryonic cells\ncreated by the hybrid technique was deeply troubling, but that she\nhad fewer problems with the company's stated purpose of making\ntransplantable tissues.\n\n   ``I think there are some ethical issues there but they are much\nless worrisome,'' she said.\n\n   The commission plans in a later report to address a second issue\nthat Clinton raised, the ethical problems and medical benefits of\nresearch on human embryonic stem cells derived from human tissue.\nEarlier this month two groups of university scientists isolated\nembryonic stem cells from embryos and from aborted fetuses, the\nfirst time that these primordial cells had cultured in the\nlaboratory.\n\n   The company that sponsored the research, the Geron Corp. of\nMenlo Park, Calif., also plans to use the cells to grow\ntransplantable tissues.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nETHICS PANEL IS GUARDED ABOUT HYBRID OF COW CELLS  \n(JT)\n","Text":["\n   Struggling to respond to President Clinton's request for\nimmediate advice on the hybrid cow-human cell announced earlier\nthis month, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has\ndelivered a guarded and somewhat tentative reply, based on the few\nfacts available to it.\n","\n   The chairman of the commission, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the\npresident of Princeton University, said in a letter to Clinton that\nthe news raised ``concerns about crossing species boundaries and\nexercising excessive control over nature.''\n","\n   The proposed use of the hybrid cells to grow human tissues for\ntransplant into a patient would or would not raise new ethical\nissues, depending on the nature of the cells, Shapiro said.\n","\n   The cells are obtained by fusing a human skin or blood cell with\na cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed.
