If the bovine mitochondria should prove incompatible\nwith their humanized environment the cells will not be viable.\n\n   Ethicists believe the mixing of species is likely to trouble the\npublic severely, at least at first. Lawyers who specialize in\nissues of human reproduction note that the moral and legal status\nof the human embryo is undecided in American law, a fact pointed up\nby the isolation of the human embryonic stem cells announced last\nweek. The new entity adds further complexity.\n\n   If Advanced Cell Technology can produce viable hybrid cells,\nthose cells will offer a new route to grow tissue for transplant.\nThis is the same goal held by the scientists who announced last\nweek they had grown human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory.\nIt is widely accepted in principle that embryonic stem cells can be\ndirected to develop into any desired tissue, with enormous\npotential for medicine, even though this has yet to be achieved in\npractice.\n\n   West said the advantage of the Advanced Cell Technology method\nwas that embryonic cells derived from the patient being treated\nwould generate entirely compatible tissues. The two methods\nreported last week, by James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin\nand John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, derive stem cells\nfrom human embryos or fetuses. Tissues made from these cells would\nbe incompatible with the patient, a problem that has yet to be\nresolved.\n\n   In support of its claim, Advanced Cell Technology supplied a\npatent application and a photograph taken of its embryonic cells\nunder a microscope. The patent application describes how the cells\nare made but provides no proof that they possess the properties to\nbe expected of human embryonic stem cells. Robl said his laboratory\nwas not set up to perform the required tests at the time the hybrid\ncells were made.\n\n   Shown the photograph of the hybrid cells, John Gearhart of Johns\nHopkins University, author of one of the two methods reported last\nweek, said that ``they certainly could be embryonic stem cells''\nbut that no scientific journal would publish the result without\nfurther proof. ``It's not that I don't believe this biologically. I\njust think they could have given a little bit more assurance as to\nwhat was done here.''\n\n   Roger Pedersen of the University of California at San Francisco,\nwho also works on human embryonic stem cells, said he doubted the\nhybrid cells would last long enough to develop into useful tissue\nbecause of their cow-derived mitochondria.\n\n   Mitochondria, former bacteria enslaved by cells eons ago, have\ntheir own genes but operate in close cooperation with genes from\nthe cell's nucleus.\n\n   Pedersen cited a recent experiment showing that within the\nhuman-ape-monkey family, each species' mitochondria is subtly\ndifferent, the more so the longer the evolutionary distance between\nthe species in question. The mitochondria of chimpanzees and\ngorillas work well enough in human cells but those of primate\nspecies that diverged more than 10 million years ago from the human\nline, do not work.\n\n   Because cows and humans last shared an ancestor so long ago, cow\nmitochondria are very unlikely to work well with a human nucleus,\nin Pedersen's view, and as most of the mitochondria in the hybrid\ncells are contributed by the cow egg, the cells would probably not\nremain viable for long. ``It's hard to say this is a total sham,\nbut I smell a sham here,'' he said.\n\n   Citing the same data, Gearhart said the mitochondria in the\nhybrid cell had clearly carried it through its first few divisions\nbut might not sustain it in further development, unless the few\nhuman mitochondria that were also present somehow took over.\n\n   Pedersen said Advanced Cell Technology should be held to a high\nstandard of proof ``because of what the implications are for\nupsetting people unnecessarily _ if you cry fire in a crowded\nauditorium you may be liable if it's a false alarm.''\n\n   The human embryonic stem cells announced last week have already\npushed against the frontiers of ethical acceptance. Experts in\nbiomedical ethics say the public is likely to be alarmed by the new\ntechnique, particularly because of the mingling of species. Murray\nof Case Western Reserve University said that the hybrid embryo\n``escapes our usual categories.'' When biologists first learned to\ntransfer genes from one species to another, ``The idea of\nhuman-animal hybrids was often raised as the kind of monstrosity\nthat no morally perceptive person would ever create,'' he said.\n\n   ``Even if it's only to create tissue, the minute you start\nmixing species you raise all kinds of red flags in people's\nminds,'' said Barnie Steinboch, a moral philosopher at the State\nUniversity of New York in Albany. But she noted that pig valves are\nnow seen as acceptable replacements in human hearts.\n\n   Rebecca Dresser, a law professor at Washington University in St.\nLouis, noted, as did several biologists, that distinctions between\nhumans and other animals are less clear in nature than they are in\npeople's minds. ``Biologically a lot of this research is showing us\nsimilarities and the upshot in a hundred years may be that the\nlines between humans and non-humans will be viewed as a little bit\ngrayer,'' she said.\n\n   A perplexing feature of the hybrid embryo is that it starts off\nmostly bovine and then becomes mostly yet not entirely human. But\nsome legal experts have no doubt that it should be regarded from\nthe start as a human embryo. ``It doesn't matter that the\nmitochondria come from a cow, it also has human mitochondria and so\nhas all the potentials of a human embryo,'' said Lori Andrews of\nthe Chicago-Kent College of Law in Chicago.\n\n   ``Once it's gone through that first division it has gone from\nbeing a somatic cell to a thing with potential life,'' she said,\nreferring to the ordinary specialized cells of the human body. If\ntransferred to a woman's uterus the embryos may or may not come to\nterm, ``but under state laws it doesn't matter whether the fetus is\ngoing to be born or not - it doesn't make them less human.''\n\n   The human body consists of 100 billion cells. Should embryos\ncreated from them by the cow egg method be regarded as having\nspecial status when they can be made so easily and plentifully? Ms.\nAndrews said that human embryos are not so hard to make the usual\nway, and the fact that an embryo is easily made, by whatever means,\nis irrelevant to arguments about its status.\n\n   The moral status of the human embryo ``is not clearly\nestablished in U.S. law,'' Dresser said. The embryo can be regarded\nas mere property, as a person, or as something in between but\ndeserving of special respect. Congress, in banning the use of\nfederal funds for research on human embryos, has favored the view\nthat they are in the category of people.
