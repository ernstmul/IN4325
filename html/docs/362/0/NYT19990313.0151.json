It focuses on border\nsecurity.\n\n   An illegal job market flourishes in Florida, prompting growing\nnumbers of migrants to turn to smugglers. And smugglers operate in\na climate of acceptable risk: a Border Patrol in Florida that\nhasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years, a Coast Guard\npatrolling a region strewn with islands of safe-havens, courts\nwrestling with complex immigration law and juries sympathetic\ntoward refugees.\n\n   About 350,000 illegal immigrants live in Florida, according to a\n1997 INS estimate.\n\n   In the years immediately following Congress' decision in 1986 to\noutlaw the hiring of illegal aliens, the Miami INS office opened\nhundreds of cases against employers. In 1988, the agency\ninvestigated 711 employers.\n\n   By the early 1990s, the caseload had dropped dramatically.\nAgents were handling fewer than 50 investigations a year. It was\nduring that period that the Border Patrol was instructed to\nconcentrate on immigrants, not employers, Kring said.\n\n   ``In the late 1980s we focused on the worksite and it made a\nhuge difference,'' Kring said. ``We'd go to worksite and maybe 80\npercent would be illegals. We'd go back and they'd be a lot less,\nand the third time you'd be lucky to find one or two. Now, we just\ndon't have the manpower to do it.''\n\n   The INS in Miami opened 126 cases last year against employers\nstatewide. Many involve employers' failue to keep decent records\nshowing whether their workers are here legally.\n\n   The agency removed 133 illegal workers from their jobs last year\nin South Florida. Offending employers were fined a total of\n$28,650.\n\n   The sanctions work, said Thomas Danter, supervisor of the\ninvestigations unit in Miami.\n\n   ``In the past, we would remove unauthorized workers and nothing\nhappened to the employers,'' he said. ``They would just go out and\nhire more.''\n\n   Now, employers can be fined up to $3,000 per worker and\nsentenced to six months in prison. Danter said he's never seen an\nemployer sentenced to prison in Florida. He's been an agent since\n1987.\n\n   Local INS officials hesitate to even talk about worksite\ninspections. Their reluctance might be traced to an April 23 raid\nat a flower wholesaler in West Dade.\n\n   A melee erupted while armed agents rounded up 23 workers at\nFirst Paragon Floral. Workers complained that agents pushed them\naround, forced them to sit on wet floors, confined them in a cold\nstorage area and shouted at them to produce their papers. Some\nemployees insisted they were legal residents or green-card workers\nand resisted the agents, prompting a call to Miami-Dade police.\n\n   Community leaders, including Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex\nPenelas, lambasted INS. It turned out that three of the arrested\nworkers were permanent residents and eight others were eligible for\nwork permits.\n\n   The raid was mentioned in a report issued by the National\nNetwork for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which accused INS agents\nnationwide of using terror tactics. The report, called ``Portrait\nof Injustice'' documented abuses in 235 INS raids.\n\n   Less than a month after the West Dade incident, INS directed its\nagents to have a written plan for every ``worksite enforcement''\nand to bring a liaison officer with them. The agency also told\ninspectors to focus on employers who hire smuggled aliens or abuse\ntheir workers.\n\n   That's exactly what the Miami office is doing, which explains\nwhy investigators have opened only eight cases against employers\nsince last fall.\n\n   ``We don't do area-control operations,'' which is Danter's way\nof saying there are no surprise raids at job sites.\n\n   That means INS agents rarely investigate the largest employer of\nunauthorized workers _ the state's fruit and vegetable growers.\n\n   No farm owner in Florida has been sanctioned for hiring illegal\nworkers during the past three years, according to data compiled by\nthe Center for Immigration Studies. Instead, INS has fined\nrestaurants, landscapers, nurseries and other small businesses.\n\n   ``If we get a lead (about a farm employing illegal workers), it\ndoes get investigated,'' Danter said. ``I haven't seen any types of\nleads recently come in on that.''\n\n   Nonetheless, even advocates for the growers say it's no secret\nthat large numbers of illegal employees are working the fruit and\nvegetable fields.\n\n   ``I've seen estimates as high as 80 percent. There's no question\nit's significant,'' said Walter Kates, a labor specialist with the\nFlorida Fruit & Vegetable Association in Orlando.\n\n   Growers can do little to weed out unauthorized workers, he\nadded. Field hands are getting jobs with counterfeit identification\nand immigration documents, he said.\n\n   ``The way the law is written, the employer cannot second-guess\nor ask for additional documents,'' Kates said. ``That becomes a\nform of discrimination and the farmer would be subject to fines.''\n\n   Counterfeit alien registration receipt cards, the new version of\nwhat was once called green cards, are widespread, he said.\n\n   ``It's always been the Achilles' heel of verification.''\n\n   Danter added that the INS doesn't expect farmers to be able to\nspot phony documents. The INS operates a separate unit dedicated to\nchasing bogus document-suppliers. In November, the INS raided a\ncounterfeiting ring in Los Angeles that produced phony documents,\nsome of which turned up in Florida.\n\n   Farm worker advocates charge that counterfeit documents offer a\nconvenient excuse for growers. Growers could check workers' records\nelectronically through a voluntary INS program being tested in\nFlorida. But none are participating.\n\n   ``There are powerful interests, fruit and vegetable growers\namong them, who want to make sure a system like this is not\nimplemented nationwide,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director\nof the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\n   Growers dodge the verification problem by hiring their field\nhands from farm labor contractors, say migrant worker advocates.\nContractors function like independent foremen. Growers pay them to\ndeliver work crews. The contractor hires pickers, and it's their\nresponsibility to check each worker's papers.\n\n   Farmers expect contractors to follow the law, said Gary Smigiel,\ngeneral counsel for Mecca Farms of Lantana. ``We require\ncontractors to hire legal help,'' he said.\n\n   No contractor in Florida has been fined for hiring illegal\nworkers during the past decade.\n\n   The state Department of Labor & Employment Security has no\nrecord of ever revoking or suspending the license of a contractor\nfor hiring undocumented workers, said an agency spokesman. The\ndepartment, which licenses contractors for the federal government,\nrefers any matters involving illegal workers to the INS.\n\n   ``Regulating contractors has done nothing,'' said attorney\nGregory Schell of the Migrant Farmworkers Justice Project in Belle\nGlade.\n\n   Farms are the ``sweatshops in the sun,'' he said. Farmers\ntreasure illegal workers because they don't complain and work for\nlow wages, he said.\n\n   Farm hands arrive in Florida owing $800 to $1,200 to smugglers,\nSchell said. Their debts often are deducted from their wages.\n\n   ``Smuggling fees take about 50 percent of what's earned, so we\nsee people crying about not being able to send money home,'' Schell\nsaid.\n\n   A contractor in western Palm Beach County, who asked that his\nidentity be protected, said harvests are done almost exclusively by\nillegal workers from Mexico. No one else will accept the jobs, the\ncontractor said.\n\n   Growers also argue that migrant workers are the only people\nwilling to work the farms. Removing illegal workers would only\ncreate a worker shortage, they say.\n\n   However, a 1997 federal report indicated that farmers need not\nworry. Less than 5 percent of the INS worksite investigations\ninvolved agriculture. Furthermore, INS officials quoted in the\nreport said they were ill-equipped to significantly reduce\nunauthorized farm workers.\n\n   Mike Hancock, director of the Department of Labor's farmworkers\ndivision in Washington, D.C., sees another force blocking an INS\ncrackdown on employers.\n\n   ``That's not going to happen because of the politics.''\n\n   For example, several congressmen, led by Sen. Paul Coverdell,\nR.-Ga., halted a massive INS raid in May on onion farms in Vidalia,\nGa. Farmers bitterly complained that their harvest would be ruined\nwithout the 4,000 to 5,000 Mexicans they hire each year.\n\n   In an unprecedented move, INS agreed to look the other way while\nscores of illegal workers harvested the onions. In exchange,\nfarmers agreed to do more to comply with migrant labor laws.\n\n   Farms are the entry-level workplaces for many illegal migrants.\nFrom there, they move to poultry farms, restaurants and lumber\nyards. Others find jobs in tourism.\n\n   ``We see most unauthorized workers in hotels and restaurants,``\nsaid INS investigator Danter.\n\n   The state's booming construction industry is another source of\njobs.\n\n   ``We hear from people who can't get jobs because they're being\ndisplaced by illegal workers,'' said Rick Grennier, chief of the\nBorder Patrol in Orlando.\n\n   Subcontractors who hire illegal workers save money and are able\nto underbid competitors, he explained. For example, agents arrested\nabout 40 illegal workers at Celebration, Disney's upscale housing\ndevelopment.\n\n   When Congress pumped up the INS budget in 1996, it added money\nfor new worksite inspectors. But it hasn't added money for more\ninspectors since then.\n\n   ``We got nothing,'' recalled Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman\nin Washington. ``The critics who complain about the lack of\ninterior enforcement are the same ones who vote against the\nresources to accomplish it.''\n\n   Still, the INS seems more vigilant in other states.\n\n   During the first nine months of 1997, the INS cited 23 employers\nin Florida for hiring illegal aliens, according to the Center for\nImmigration Studies. Incomplete 1997 figures were the most recent\ndata available.\n\n   But in the same period, INS sanctioned 89 employers in New York,\n57 in Texas, 27 in New Jersey, 28 in Pennsylvania and 30 in Ohio.\n\n   The INS is expected to soon unveil a five-year plan that focuses\non illegal workers, document fraud and smuggling within the United\nStates, Bergeron said.\n\n   The plan is long overdue, say critics. And until it is\nimplemented, immigrants will continue to pay smugglers to bring\nthem to the farms, the restuarants, the hotels and construction\nsites.\n\n   ``Congress is telling aliens that if they can run the gauntlet,\nthen they can work here,'' said Krikorian of the Center for\nImmigration Studies. ``It's a moral issue. The nation is provoking\nillegal immigration, but making that immigration dangerous.''\n\n   Palm Beach Post staff writer John Holland contributed to this\nreport.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise of jobs fuels the business\nof migrant smuggling, and Florida offers a land of opportunity for\nthose who sneak across its borders.\n","\n   ``Personally, I believe that if you focused on employees and\ncontractors and take away all sources of employment ... you can\nliterally turn your back on the borders,'' said Billy Kring, former\nchief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami.\n","\n   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which oversees the\nBorder Patrol, does just the opposite.
