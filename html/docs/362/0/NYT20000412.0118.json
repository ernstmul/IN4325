No one I know would\nhave done this work,'' she said through an interpreter, Virginia\nCoto, a lawyer with the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.\n\n   Coto said the sex trafficking ring that snared Maria also preyed\non Mexican girls as young as 14, like Rosa, a child from Veracruz.\n\n   ``I can't put it behind me. I still feel shame. I was a decent\ngirl in Mexico. I used to go to church with my family,'' Rosa said\nin a statement submitted to the committee.\n\n   The State Department and other federal agencies estimate that\nabout 1 million women and children are held against their will,\nraped, beaten and sold to the highest bidder each year worldwide.\n\n   About 50,000 are brought to the United States from other\ncountries.\n\n   ``We are talking about slavery,'' said William Yeomans, chief of\nstaff for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ``This is\nas barbaric as the trade that brought African-Americans to this\ncountry.''\n\n   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to strengthen laws\nagainst those who traffic in humans for sex, labor and other\npurposes.

Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the chairman of the\ncommittee hearing the testimony.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   For Maria, the events began innocently enough.\n\n   Wearing a maroon dress, a scarf and sunglasses, she told\nlawmakers that her illegal immigration into the United States\nquickly plummeted into a living hell.\n\n   ``I am in fear for my life now more than ever,'' she told\nlawmakers who listened intently to her story from the ornate,\nfourth-floor room of the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol\nHill.\n\n   In May 1997, she held a job in a general retail store and worked\nas a domestic helper in Veracruz, Mexico. She was not married, but\nshe had a daughter and worked two jobs to feed and clothe her\nfamily.\n\n   An acquaintance approached her about jobs available in the\nUnited States, in restaurants and bars that paid more money. Maria\njumped at the opportunity, and a ``coyote,'' or smuggler, took her\nacross the Rio Grande, near Matamoros, to Texas, where she was kept\nin a safe house until she was smuggled to Florida.\n\n   There, she testified, a man named Abel Cadena informed her that\nshe would be working at a brothel as a prostitute to work off her\n$2,200 debt for being smuggled into the United States.\n\n   The woman testified that she was given ``tight clothes to wear''\nand taken to a mobile home brothel to work with other girls in\nsimilar straits.\n\n   ``Armed men were selling tickets to customers in the trailer.\nTickets were condoms,'' Maria said. ``At the end of the night, I\nturned in the condom wrappers. Each wrapper represented a supposed\ndeduction to my smuggling fee. We tried to keep our own records,\nbut the bosses would destroy them.\n\n   ``We were never sure what we owed.''\n\n   Each brothel had four girls and armed guards. The trailers were\nlocated in rural and isolated areas. ``We were transported every 15\ndays to another trailer in a nearby city,'' she said. ``This was to\ngive customers a variety of girls, and so we never knew where we\nwere in case we tried to escape.''\n\n   Women who escaped and were caught were severely punished with\nbeatings and rape, she said.\n\n   ``All I could do is stand there and watch,'' she said. ``I was\ntoo afraid to try to escape.''\n\n   Maria's servitude ended in 1998 when federal and state law\nenforcement officers broke up the prostitution ring that catered to\nHispanic migrant farm workers throughout central Florida. ``The\nwomen and girls were forced to engage in sexual acts with as many\nas 130 men a week. They were beaten and assaulted, and some were\nforced to have abortions when they became pregnant,'' Yeomans said.\n``We prosecuted the case and obtained seven guilty pleas.''\n\n   In April 1999, Mexican authorities arrested Abel Cadena Sosa in\nVeracruz on a U.S. extradition warrant alleging he participated in\na prostitution ring using underage Mexican women.\n\n   He is being held in Mexico City's Southern Penitentiary.\n\n   Coto, of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, said other men\ninvolved in the prostitution ring who were prosecuted in the United\nStates received as few as two years in jail. ``Eight defendants are\nstill at large,'' she told the senators, adding that ``these\nsurvivors cannot return to the same neighborhoods where their\n(former) captors live, and would surely retaliate against them.''\n\n   Federal authorities first detained the victims of the Cadena\nring.\n\n   ``They did not receive medical or psychological treatment. They\ndid not have adequate legal assistance,'' Coto said.\n\n   ``They did not understand what happened to them and what was\ngoing to happen,'' she said. ``What they did know is that they were\nterrified and needed help.''\n\n   In time, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center won their release\nto Safespace, a battered women's shelter in Miami.\n\n   Because they are illegal immigrants, they are not eligible for\npublic benefits in the United States. Community groups have\nprovided psychological counseling, medical care, food and shelter.\n\n   Maria said the experience still haunts her. She is afraid of\npeople, and she suffers from ``flashbacks.'' Maria urged the\nsenators to help other young women ``so that they will not suffer\nas we did in the United States.''\n\n   ``We were tricked into coming here,'' she said. ``Please help\nme. Please help us. Please do not let this happen to anyone else.''\n\n          \n\n   (Gary Martin's e-mail address is gmartin(at)express-news.net)\n","Headline":"\n      GOVERNMENT WEIGHS TOUGHENING LAWS AGAINST SEXUAL SLAVERY \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Maria's voice is a whisper, but her lurid tale of\nbeing taken from Mexico and sold as a sex slave in Florida is a\ndamning indictment of the growing problem of the international\ntrafficking of women and girls.\n","\n   Three years ago, at age 18, she was moved from one mobile home\nto another in rural Florida, where she was forced to service up to\n35 men per day.\n","\n   ``Weekends were worse,'' Maria said. ``Our bodies were utterly\nsore and swollen.''\n","\n   She knew how many men she had been with from counting the\nwrappers of condoms the migrant farm workers purchased for $25 _\n``tickets'' that were exchanged for intimate time with the young\nwoman. ``I could not believe this was happening to me,'' Maria\nsaid.\n","\n   The woman, who is now receiving counseling in the United States,\ntestified before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee earlier\nthis month, describing her ordeal before a packed hearing room.\n","\n   ``I would never ever have done this work.
