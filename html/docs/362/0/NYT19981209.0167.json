Most Europeans concede that Americans\nare more experienced in defending a long land border.\n\n   Illegal migration via land routes only became a problem in\nWestern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Before\nthen, the Iron Curtain kept the EU's eastern flank secure, and most\nundocumented migrants came up from the south, from across the\nMediterranean Sea.\n\n   Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, 10 EU countries have\ndismantled entry controls along their shared internal borders,\nmaking their territory even more alluring for illegal migration.\n\n   As pressure has built in the 1990s to keep illegal migrants out\nof the EU, politicians, police and academics from Europe and the\nUnited States have shuttled back and forth across the Atlantic,\nattending seminars and observing border patrols in action.\n\n   ``In recent years, we've had more and more visitors from\nEurope,'' says Doug Mosier, spokesman for the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service in Dallas. ``I think that, in terms of\ntechnologies and strategies, the U.S. is still seen as the\npioneer.''\n\n   A little more than a million immigrants settle legally in the\nEuropean Union every year _ about the same number as in the United\nStates and Canada put together. Of the many people claiming asylum\nin the EU this year, about 250,000 _ roughly double the figure for\nthe United States _ are expected to pass the first legal hurdles to\nhave their cases heard.\n\n   But further comparisons are hard to make. European migration\nstatistics are patchy, because EU states keep separate records, use\ndifferent accounting methods and often keep their findings secret.\n\n   According to the INS, U.S. border patrol agents arrested 1.4\nmillion undocumented migrants in the 1996-97 fiscal year. The INS\nestimates that 275,000 people slip into the United States illegally\neach year.\n\n   No such official figures are available for the EU as a whole,\nbut some experts suspect that up to half a million migrants make it\npast border guards into the European Union every year.\n\n   Impressed by the American track record in nabbing illegal\nimmigrants at the border, Europeans have taken up much of the\nhigh-tech gadgetry, such as infrared binoculars and cameras, used\nby U.S. Border Patrol agents. EU states are also moving to build a\nU.S.-style database that would pool information on asylum-seekers.\n\n   In communications, the United States is showing the way with\nencrypted two-way digital radios and the growing use of satellite\ntechnology to pinpoint border agents on patrol. ``Our radios are\nantiques in comparison,'' grumbles Steenfatt. ``Sometimes they\ndon't even work (30 feet) away.''\n\n   At 2,000 miles, the U.S.-Mexico border is shorter than the\neastern frontier of the European Union, which runs for more than\n2,500 miles from Finland to Italy.\n\n   But Americans seem more willing to install occasional fixed\nbarriers along their border, such as the 1.2-mile chain-link fence\nin El Paso, in an effort to keep illegal immigrants out.\n\n   Haunted by memories of the Iron Curtain, many Europeans _\nparticularly Germans _ prefer to leave their frontiers physically\nopen, apart from border checkpoints on key roads. Germany even\nshuns automated cameras and sensors.\n\n   ``Our different history gives us some different attitudes than\nthe Americans,'' says Eckehart Wache, who commands guards along a\n160-mile stretch of German-Polish border. ``We do not want fences\nand walls or an automated border system. We always want an officer\nto be on the spot to make the decision.''\n\n   U.S. and EU border police are caught in the same vicious circle:\nThe better they get at their job, the more migrants turn to\ncriminals who smuggle human cargo.\n\n   On both sides of the Atlantic, the people-smuggling industry is\nthriving, though experts think traffickers in Europe may have\nstronger links with organized crime and more sophisticated\nequipment.\n\n   EU border police face a more diverse mix of migrants than their\ncounterparts in the United States.\n\n   People from all over the developing world are caught sneaking\nacross the southwestern U.S. border, but the vast majority are\nMexican. Once criminal background checks are run, illegal migrants\nfrom Mexico often are taken to an international bridge, where\nBorder Patrol agents watch them cross back to their native country.\n\n   Things are not so simple in Europe, where most undocumented\nmigrants hail from countries not directly bordering the EU. Often\nthey have sold everything and traveled thousands of miles to start\na new life in Europe. Many will try anything _ from refusing to\ngive their identities to filing weak claims for asylum _ to avoid\nbeing sent back.\n\n   Although instant deportation is becoming more common, EU states\nstill face legal and diplomatic obstacles to expelling illegal\nmigrants.\n\n   In one regard, though, EU border police have a clear edge over\ntheir American peers.
