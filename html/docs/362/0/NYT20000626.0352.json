A BUNDLE OF CONTRADICTIONS,\nAPPARENTLY \n\n  (With main bar, SCI-GENOME; see SCIENCE-TIMES-BUDGET for a complete\ndescription of sidebar stories and graphics.) \n By NATALIE ANGIER   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The human genome, the sum of all genetic material encased in\nnearly every cell of the human body, is very, very long _ at least\nthree billion chemical letters long, as many letters as you would\nfind in a thousand copies of an entire Sunday issue of The New York\nTimes.\n\n   The human genome is pithy. The English alphabet has 26 letters;\nthe Russian, 33 letters; and the Japanese, 1, 850 symbols. Yet,\nwith just four distinct characters at its disposal, four nucleic\nacid bases, the human genome has given rise to the creators of\nevery language uttered, every ballad sung, every Pokemon card\ntraded.\n\n   The human genome is a pigsty, bulging with non-genes, ex-genes,\nfreeloader genes, viral detritus, pocket lint and chewing gum. All\nbut a few percent of it appears to be doing nothing at all.\n\n   The human genome is a pearl, a model of high performance and\nreliability. Millions of times a year, egg genome meets sperm\ngenome, and the result is a human baby, its parts all in place, its\nbrain a universe of love and meaning.\n\n   In short, the human genome exults in contradictions.\n\n   And scientists, with their announcement that they have completed\na so-called working draft of the entire sequence of the human\ngenome, must traffic in a few contradictions of their own. They\nrightly regard the sequencing of the genome as a major scientific\nlandmark.\n\n   ``This is a milestone in biology unlike any other,'' said\nFrancis S. Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research\nInstitute. ``We only have to do this once, reading out the sequence\nof our own instruction book, and here we are on brink of it.''\n\n   At the same time, scientists know that the bulk of their work in\ndeciphering that sequence has yet to be done. ``Complexity is the\nword on everybody's lips these days when they see what the genome\nreally looks like,'' said David Baltimore, the molecular biologist\nand Nobel laureate who is president of the California Institute of\nTechnology. ``We've got another century of work ahead of us, to\nfigure out how all these things relate to each other.''\n\n   Though scientists underscore the importance of their\naccomplishment by calling the genome a ``portrait of who we are,''\nthey quickly append that: people are not, and never will be, mere\nproducts of their genes.\n\n   ``One of my concerns is, that as we begin to glimpse some of the\nbiological contributions to certain personality traits, in people's\nminds those contributions will loom larger than they should,''\nCollins said. ``And the notion of genetic determinism will gather\nfurther momentum that it doesn't deserve.''\n\n   Even in the case of a seemingly familial disease like\nschizophrenia, for example, unknown environmental factors still\nloom large, which is why if one identical twin comes down with the\ndisorder, the other twin has only a 50 percent chance of suffering\nthe same fate _ despite being genetic clones.\n\n   Researchers want to talk about the medical miracles they expect\nto come from a better knowledge of the human genome. They don't\nwant to promise any cure or palliative too soon. Yet they feel\ninspired to let their imaginations go as they fantasize about what\nthe sequence may reveal, and what it may forever conceal.\n\n   For some, the emerging details of the genome sequence are most\nfascinating for what they say about the fraternity between the\nhuman species and all other creatures on earth.\n\n   ``Looking at the genome, and taking it as a kind of image of who\nwe are, places us squarely with the rest of nature,'' said Jon\nSeger, an evolutionary biologist and geneticist at the University\nof Utah in Salt Lake City.\n\n   ``You can see the same genes in flies, worms, monkeys, mice and\npeople. It's evolution laid out for all to see. There's nothing\npeculiar or distinctive about us.''\n\n   Except, perhaps, for the species-wide homogeneity of humans.\n\n   Some scientists emphasize the genetic fraternity of humanity.\nHumans may be genomically similar to mice and monkeys, but it turns\nout that people are extraordinarily similar to each other: there\nare far fewer genetic differences, or polymorphisms, among\ndifferent peoples, and populations of peoples, than are observed in\nindividual members of other species, including ape relatives.\n\n   This discovery, scientists say, has profound implications for\nunderstanding the various human ``races.'' Kelly Owens and\nMary-Claire King, geneticists at the University of Washington in\nSeattle, argued last year in the journal Science that whatever\ngenetic differences existed between, say, Africans and Europeans,\nor Asians and aborigines, they were likely to be literally\nskin-deep.\n\n   The researchers described how the recent analysis of the\nso-called melanocortin-stimulating hormone receptor gene, which is\ninvolved in melanin production, indicated that small discrepancies\nin this receptor gene appeared to account for most of the\nvariations observed in human skin and hair color and texture. If\ntrue, they wrote, then variation at a single, tiny genetic locus in\ncharge of ``superficial traits'' had been ``the cause of enormous\nsuffering.''\n\n   ``Of course, prejudice does not require a rational basis, let\nalone an evolutionary one,'' they said in the article. ``But the\nmyth of major genetic differences across `races' is nonetheless\nworth dismissing with genetic evidence.''\n\n   Scientists are also falling over each other for the prize for\nthe most apt analogy. What is the genome really? Is it the Book of\nLife, the Booklet of Life, a blueprint for a human being, an atlas,\na master parts list? Martha Stewart's ``How to Replicate?''\n\n   ``There's a metaphor contest going on,'' said Harold Varmus, the\nformer director of the National Institutes of Health and now\npresident of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.\n``I've used quite a few of them myself.''\n\n   These days, he said, ``I've decided we've got to get away from\nthe idea of this as a blueprint. That doesn't convey what we have.\nBecause we don't just have the linear sequence, we have the\nphysical parts, too.''\n\n   In other words, he said, computer databases may hold the\nsequence information, the lineup of billions of A's, T's, G's and\nC's. But the segments of the genome also exist in physical form, in\nthe bellies of bacterial and yeast cells, which can be manipulated.\n``The important thing is having pieces of DNA in your hand, and\nbeing able to figure out how they work by modifying and mutating\nthem,'' he said. ``That's where the game is now.''\n\n   Which is why his favorite metaphor is a kid with a clock. ``You\ncan take the clock apart, lay the pieces out in front of you, and\nthen try to understand what makes it tick by putting it back\ntogether again,'' he said.\n\n   nn\n\n   Yet, as any would-be Edison soon discovers, it's easier to\ndeconstruct than reconstruct. And scientists are having a difficult\ntime making sense of even the most basic springs and gears of the\ngenome. They don't yet know how many genes the three billion\nchemical letters hold, for example, with estimates ranging from a\nlow of 25,000 to a high of 150,000.\n\n   ``The fashionable arguing over gene number,'' said David Page of\nthe Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who is studying the\nsequences of the human sex chromosomes, ``reveals just how\ndifficult it is to deliver anything concrete with the current state\nof sequence analysis.''\n\n   Biologists also disagree vehemently on the meaning of the vast\nstretches of non-gene material in the genome, the estimated 2.5\nbillion to 2.8 billion chemical letters that do not appear to take\npart in the synthesis of proteins, which are the body's worker\nbees, the molecules that comprise the body and keep it alive.\n\n   ``More than 95 percent of our DNA is just there, and it's\ndescribed as not functional,'' said C. Robert Cloninger, who\nstudying personality and genomics at Washington University in St.\nLouis. ``But I don't know of anything in nature that's just laying\naround and is not functional.''\n\n   But ``functional'' from whose perspective? The human body may\nnot recruit the sequences for protein duty, but if the sequences do\nus no harm, natural selection may not have bothered to get rid of\nthem. Just as microscopic mites live on our cheek cells and\neyelashes, so our genomes may carry a plethora of nucleic\nsquatters.\n\n   ``We can identify almost 50 percent of the genome as being\nso-called repetitive elements, or transposable elements, which are\nlike little viruses that have taken advantage of the cell's\nmachinery to replicate themselves,'' said Phil Green, a genomics\nresearcher at the University of Washington. ``And the real number\nmay be more like 95 percent of the genome, although a lot of these\ntransposable elements are so ancient that they're hard to\nidentify.''\n\n   In Green's view, the notion of the human genome as a haven for\ntransposable elements is humbling. ``Not only aren't we the center\nof the universe,'' he said, ''we're not even the center of our own\ngenome. We only have a small part of our own genome that's really\nus.''\n\n   As he sees it, the human genome, compared to the genomes of\nfast-breeding organisms like bacteria, is ``distinctly suboptimal.\nA bacterial genome is densely packed with genes, and there's almost\nno junk _ bacteria just can't afford the baggage.'' But because\nhumans live long and reproduce slowly, and historically have\nexisted in small numbers, their genomes have not been under\ncompetitive pressure to streamline themselves to Swiss-watch\nefficiency.\n\n   ``Even the genes that are there may be suboptimal,'' he said.\n``Many genes may have picked up mutations that cause their protein\nproducts to work not quite as well as they could, but there hasn't\nbeen selective pressure to weed out all mutations.''\n\n   Still another insight that emerges from a meditation on the\nhuman genome is: not only is no man or woman an island, no gene is,\neither. Genes work in groups, and the performance and specific\narchitecture of each intimately affects the performance of the\nothers.\n\n   ``It's the law of universal epistasis, which means that nothing\nis simple, and everything depends on everything else,'' said\nCloninger. He and his colleagues have been working on genome scans\nto link personality traits with specific genes and genetic\npatterns. The more they look, the more tangled the human portrait\nbecomes. From studies of twins and similar research, scientists had\nestimated that, as with schizophrenia, about half of the observed\nvariations in many personality traits were environmental in origin,\nand half were genetic.\n\n   But comprehending the genetic half is now complicated by the\nfact that it is not enough to tally up the impact on a trait of\nthis, that and the other gene, said Cloninger. ``You must consider\nthe complex and nonadditive interactions between the different\ngenes,'' he said. For example, he and his colleagues have studied\nthe trait called novelty seeking _ the thirst for new experiences\n_and found it to be influenced by three genes: one involved in the\nbrain's use of the neurochemical dopamine, another in the\nneurochemical serotonin, and a third in catecholamine production,\npart of the body's fight-or-flight response. If two siblings share\nidentical forms of all three genes, they turn out to correlate in\ntheir degree of novelty-seeking behavior by about 40 percent. But\nif just one of the three genes differs in form between the\nsiblings, the correlation drops, not to 20 percent or 30 percent,\nas one might expect, but to 10 percent or less. The three genes\nwork as a tightly knit team, together with other tightly knit teams\nthat have yet to be discovered.\n\n   ``We tend to like to think in terms of separate things operating\ncausally in linear sequence,'' said Cloninger. ``But that's not an\naccurate picture of the way biology works.''\n\n   So maybe another metaphor for the human genome is a human dream:\nrich with significance, personal yet universal, stuffed with\nnonsense, all out of order yet infused with its own mad logic.   \n","Headline":"\nANALYSIS: WHAT IS THE GENOME?
