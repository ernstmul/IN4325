(nk) \n By NICHOLAS WADE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The ancestors of Africans and non-Africans split apart almost\n200,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought, a study of\nDNA in living populations has found.\n\n   The estimate is so early that it precedes by some 70,000 years\nthe first known fossils of modern humans.\n\n   The authors of the study say they cannot tell in which branch of\nthe split population the genes that shape modern humans first\ndeveloped, but they believe the genes spread quickly throughout the\nother branch because of the advantage they conferred.\n\n   The study, published in Monday's Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences, also reports the first fixed DNA difference\nbetween African and non-African populations. The difference, which\nmay be rendered less absolute when more people are tested, is in a\nsingle chemical unit of DNA that has no functional significance.\nSeveral geneticists said the finding does not alter the\nwell-established fact that different ethnic groups differ very\nlittle at the genetic level.\n\n   The new finding, if sustained, is surprising in the light of two\nwidely held assumptions about human origins. One is the view that\nmodern humans evolved in sub-Saharan Africa and, in a later split,\na small band then emigrated to populate the rest of the world. The\nother is the expectation that only a handful of minor genes\nunderlying superficial characteristics like hair and skin color\nwould show sharp differences between major population groups. The\ngene under study is part of an enzyme, known as pyruvate\ndehydrogenase, which controls an important step in glucose\nmetabolism.\n\n   Monday's report, by Dr. Eugene E. Harris and Dr. Jody Hey of\nRutgers University in New Jersey, suggests that the archaic human\npopulation split first, probably in Africa, and that the modernity\ntypical of people today developed later.\n\n   Hey said that he and Harris selected the pyruvate gene purely\nfor reasons of convenience: It lies on the X chromosome, and by\nstudying the gene in men, who have only one copy of the X\nchromosome, they had to determine the sequence of DNA units only\nonce in each individual.\n\n   They sequenced a 4,200-unit long segment of DNA from the\npyruvate gene in 16 Africans, 19 non-Africans and two male\nchimpanzees. The forebears of chimps and of humans are believed to\nhave split into separate species some 5 million years ago, which\nyielded a time scale for measuring the rate of mutation in the DNA\nsegment. Though the number of DNA samples was small, the\nresearchers said their statistical analysis produced a meaningful\nresult.\n\n   The Rutgers biologists noted 25 positions in the DNA segment at\nwhich their human subjects tended to have different chemical\nletters from the chimp sequence. The differences are caused by\nsuccessive changes or mutations in units of DNA, allowing a family\ntree of the changes to be constructed.\n\n   Assuming the mutations occur at regular intervals, like a\nsteadily ticking molecular clock, the Rutgers biologists concluded\nthat the ancestral hominid sequence is 1.86 million years old. This\nis about the time of an archaic human species known as Homo\nhabilis, and confirms the idea that much of the genetic variation\nin living populations is very old.\n\n   Much later, at about 189,000 years ago, the researchers said,\nthe gene tree split into African and non-African branches, a point\nmarked by a new mutation found only in the non-African subjects. At\na place in the gene where Africans have the chemical sequence GCG,\nnon-Africans have GCA, the letters standing for different units in\nDNA. In the genetic code, both GCG and GCA specify the same amino\nacid unit of a protein, so the difference has no practical effect.\n\n   However the date it implies for an African/non-African split is\nsubstantially earlier than estimates so far derived from other\nparts of the human genome, which range from 100,000 to 156,000\nyears ago. Hey said these estimates did not, as his does, take into\naccount the subsequent flow of genes between the separate branches,\nan omission which lowers the apparent splitting date.\n\n   The Rutgers biologists cannot say from their study where the\nsplit took place, though presumably it was somewhere in Africa. But\nfrom the amount of variability seen in their DNA sequences, they\ncan estimate the effective size of the ancestral human population,\nwhich they put at a mere 18,000 people. Estimates from other genes\nrange from 11,000 to 18,000, numbers thought not to have been\ngreatly exceeded until a population expansion began some 50,000\nyears ago.\n\n   Hey said that 18,000 people, even hunter-gatherers, do not take\nup a lot of room, and that the African/non-African population split\ncould still have left the two groups close to each other, even if\ngeographically separated. When the gene changes that led to\nmodernity evolved, they would have reached and quickly spread\nthrough the other because of the powerful selective advantage they\nconferred.\n\n   Hey said his genetic data give no clue on whether the genes for\nmodernity first evolved in the African or non-African\nsub-population. Given that the transitional fossils and many of the\nearliest modern fossils appear in Africa, the African population\nseemed to him the likelier candidate, he said.\n\n   Defenders of the established view that modern humans arose from\narchaic hominids in sub-Saharan Africa may wait for confirming\nevidence before changing their minds. In a commentary on the new\nreport, Dr. Rosalind M. Harding, a geneticist at the John Radcliffe\nHospital in Oxford, writes that true dates could be twice or half\nthe estimates derived at present from genetic data, such is the\nrange of uncertainty in genetic dating methods.\n\n   nn\n\n   Population genetics is a rigorous science but is statistical in\nnature and depends on several general assumptions that may not\nalways perfectly mirror actual events. Those who study human\norigins from the fossil evidence believe their dates, usually based\non radiocarbon, are more firmly grounded than the geneticists'\nmolecular clocks.\n\n   Richard Klein, an archeologist at Stanford University, said he\ngave even odds on whether the African/non-African split occurred\nbefore human modernity, as the new study says, or after. ``In the\nend the genetics will have to accommodate the fossil and\narcheological records, not the reverse,'' he said.\n\n   Dr. Ofer Bar-Yosef, an archeologist at Harvard University, said\nthe archeological record supported the geneticists' calculation\nthat the early human population was very small. But the\narcheological evidence is silent, he said, on whether there was a\npopulation split 200,000 years ago.\n\n   But Dr. Henry C. Harpending, a geneticist at the University of\nUtah, said he too had seen signs, from study of a different genetic\nregion, of splits in the pre-modern human population. ``I like the\nidea,'' he said.\n\n   The second surprise in the Rutgers report relates to the\nwell-established finding that humans as a species show very little\ngenetic difference between their various subpopulations. All people\nhave exactly the same set of genes, as far as is known, but the\ngenes come in slightly different flavors, embodied by minor\nvariations in the DNA sequence. Overall, there is much more\nvariation among people within a subpopulation than between\npopulations.\n\n   The gene fragment studied by Hey and Harris is unusual in that\nthe versions of the gene found in Africans and non-Africans are\nquite different. Hey said he viewed the gene as an anomaly and that\n``our data cannot be interpreted as supporting the idea of very\ndistinct races or populations.''\n\n   ``Human biologists have always known that there would be some\ngenes out there that would show this pattern, such as those for\nhair color, so finding this gene doesn't change the overall story\nthat most genes do not show this kind of pattern,'' he said.\n\n   The pyruvate gene has no obvious correlation with any known\ndifference among major population groups.\n\n   ``It is surprising to find this all-or-none difference when\npreviously we would have expected just frequency differences,''\nsaid Dr. James F. Crow, a geneticist at the University of\nWisconsin. He described the pyruvate gene finding as a ``striking\nexception'' to the rule that different versions of a gene tend to\nbe present to varying extents in all populations.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Hey believes that Africans and non-Africans may have distinctly\ndifferent versions of the gene because of a ``genetic sweep'' that\nerased much of the variability in the non-African version of the\ngene. A genetic sweep occurs when some gene or element of a gene\nconfers so large a survival advantage that a wide region of DNA on\neither side of it becomes embedded in the whole population. Since\nnone of the mutations found by the Rutgers group make any practical\ndifference, Hey believes the point of selective advantage may lie\nin another part of the gene or even in a neighboring gene.\n\n   The selective advantage, whatever it was, may have conferred an\nedge against some threat _ perhaps a disease or climatic change _\nconfronted only by non-Africans. ``It was some kind of\nenvironmental difference but I don't have a clue as to what,'' Hey\nsaid.
