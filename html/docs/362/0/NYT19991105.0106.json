Monkeys, she added, make horrible pets.\n\n   ``They can't be housebroken,'' she said. ``They're like a\n2-year-old. They require 24-hour care. You just can't lock them in\na cage.''\n\n   At the Humane Society, the marmoset has grown to 3 ounces in\nweight and 5 inches in length. Over the weekend, a volunteer will\ntake it to the Texas sanctuary.\n\n   ``We gave her fluids, and she just devoured them,'' said Pettit,\nwho has worked in Uganda with African primates. ``Most people feed\nthem fruits and vegetables when they need more protein. In the\nwild, they eat crickets and other insects as well as fruit. They\neat a lot of sap.''\n\n   People don't understand that these monkeys need a great deal of\nsocial stimulation, she said.\n\n   Pettit said: ``Usually, babies stay with their mother for two\nyears. They're constantly clinging. They need to learn from their\nmoms and other animals in the group. Who knows what had happened to\nher in her past. We don't know what she's been through.''\n\n   In California, it is against the law to import any of a long\nlist of animals. The list includes both wild and domestic animals,\nincluding primates, prairie dogs, hedgehogs and ferrets.\n\n   Violating the law is a misdemeanor offense carrying a penalty of\nup to $1,000 and one year in jail.\n\n   The young woman who bought the marmoset won't be prosecuted. The\nHumane Society is keeping her identity confidential out of concern\nthat releasing her name might discourage others from bringing in\nanimals that need help.\n\n   Meanwhile, state animal protection agencies are grappling with\nhow to deal with animal trafficking on the Internet.\n\n   ``There isn't anything anyone can do about people buying animals\non the Internet,'' said Ron Jurick, a state Fish and Game\nDepartment enforcement agent. ``You can advertise anything you\nwant. You can buy anything you want. ... The enforcement would come\nat the border or once the animal's here.''\n\n   It is illegal to smuggle certain animals into California whether\nthe sale took place over the Internet or not. The state operates 16\ncheckpoints for cars, and airlines monitor for the illegal\nimportation of live animals. Some seaports also check.\n\n   ``We know there are lots of things that are smuggled across the\nborder,'' Jurick said. ``Every once in a while, there'll be an\naccident, and something like a caiman will get out. It's a\nreflection of what's going on all the time.''\n\n   There are reasons for the laws, he said. The animals can spread\ndisease, threaten native species and end up suffering before they\ndie. Also, taking them depletes their native countries' wildlife\npopulations.\n\n   Under federal law, it's illegal to buy or sell an endangered\nspecies in interstate commerce, whether it's over the Internet or\nnot, said Special Agent Bob Snow of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService office in Burlingame. In the last year, Snow's office\ninvestigated sales of endangered species on the Internet.\n\n   His agency also prohibits commerce in marine mammals and\nmigratory birds, including stuffed songbirds and raptors. The sale\nof dead animals or parts is also prohibited, including walrus tusks\nand whale baleen.\n\n   Federal laws carry fines of up to $250,000 and five years in\nprison.\n\n   ``We see people buying animal parts over the Internet _ leopard\nskins, rhinoceros horns, elephant ivory, sea turtles and turtle\nproducts,'' Snow said.\n\n   People list the items for auction on sites like eBay, which has\ncooperated with the federal government by removing the illegal\nofferings when it hears about them, said Snow.\n\n   This weekend, Chichica, the marmoset, is going to the country's\noldest and largest primate sanctuary, Primarily Primates in San\nAntonio.\n\n   Its founder and director, Wallace Swett, believes that the\nanimal was trapped in the wild and smuggled into the United States.\n\n   ``I've become increasingly alarmed about the rise in sales of\nexotics, especially facilitated by the Internet right now,'' said\nSwett.\n\n   ''The trade itself is alarming. But with the Internet\nadvertisements and sales right now, it makes it even less possible\nto check on the credentials of the sellers or how they came in\npossession of this type of wildlife.''\n","Headline":"\nILLEGAL TRAFFICKING IN LIVE ANIMALS GROWING ON THE INTERNET \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ A young man walked into the Peninsula Humane\nSociety in San Mateo, Calif., two weeks ago, holding a shoe box.\nInside was a tiny tree- dwelling monkey no bigger than his hand, a\nSouth American pygmy marmoset.\n","\n   Just like buying a pair of shoes, the man's girlfriend had\npurchased the baby primate as a novelty on the Internet.\n","\n   The marmoset, quiet and cold, had started to fail, and the man\nwas desperately trying to save its life.\n","\n   Humane Society officials warmed and fed the wild monkey, which\nis illegal to possess in California, and this weekend will send it\nto a Texas primate sanctuary.\n","\n   Dr. Kari Pettit, the Peninsula Humane Society's staff\nveterinarian, along with other animal protection experts, say the\nyoung marmoset _ which has been named Chichica _ is just one more\nexample of the growing problem of illegal Internet trafficking in\nlive animals and parts of dead endangered species.\n","\n   ``It's unfortunate that people are able to get these animals,''\nPettit said. ``We see everything from water dragons to snakes to\nchameleons to exotic birds.''\n","\n   More than 1,000 Internet sites _ some under the phrase ``animals\nfor sale'' _ offer to sell, give care advice or, covertly, provide\nchat rooms where buyers and sellers can haggle over price,\naccording to Connecticut-based Friends of Animals.\n","\n   Just last week Pettit read a woman's chat room query for\nmarmoset breeders and potential sellers. ``It was horrendous,'' she\nsaid.
