By NICHOLAS WADE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Biologists have converted cells from the embryo of a mouse into\nspecialized brain cells capable of repairing a brain defect.\n\n   The research, reported in an article in Science that is being\npublished Friday, lends substance to the hope of using human\nembryonic stem cells to replace any of a patient's diseased tissues\nand organs.\n\n   The first of many steps in this grand design is to learn how to\ndrive these embryonic cells down particular lineages toward each of\nthe many different types of mature cell found in the adult body.\nThe Science article, by Dr. Oliver Bruestle of the University of\nBonn, in Germany, and by other authors, suggests that it may easier\nthan expected to mix suitable cocktails of growth factors to govern\nthese transformations.\n\n   Using growth factors developed in earlier work, the researchers\nconverted mouse embryonic cells into all-purpose brain cells and\nthen into a specialized type of brain cell that wraps neurons in a\nsheaf of the insulating material known as myelin.\n\n   When the cells were injected in rats that are genetically\nincapable of making myelin, they successfully clad the rat neurons\nin insulation. If human embryonic cells can be converted into\nmyelin-making cells the same way, the method could eventually help\ntreat human neurological disorders, the authors say.\n\n   Human embryonic stem cells, derived from surplus human embryos\ncreated in fertility clinics, were first grown successfully by Dr.\nJames A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin. Thomson said he\nplanned to work with one of the authors of the mouse experiment,\nDr. Ian D. Duncan of the University of Wisconsin, to see whether\nhuman embryonic cells can be converted to myelin-making brain cells\nwith the same methods.\n\n   Among the many technical problems in using human embryonic cells\nas therapy is that of rejection by the patient's immune system. A\nmuch-discussed approach would be to take one of Thomson's stem\ncells, which can be grown in profusion, and to replace the cell's\nnucleus, containing its DNA, with a nucleus from one of the\npatient's skin cells.\n\n   The main body of an embryonic cell is thought to be capable of\n``reprogramming'' a nucleus inserted into it. The embryonic stem\ncells would then be almost identical to those from which the\npatient's body was originally generated. Converted into brain\ncells, say, they should present no challenge to the patient's\nimmune system.\n\n   Human embryonic cells cannot form an embryo because they lack\nthe embryo's other component, a sphere of organizing cells that are\nnot themselves part of the embryo but help shape the developing\nembryonic cells into an organized structure. Left to themselves,\nembryonic stem cells in the laboratory will often develop into a\nchaotic mass of different tissues known as a teratoma.\n\n   Researchers have derived mouse heart cells from a teratoma and\nhave shown the cells will work efficiently in a mouse. But the\nScience article seems to be one of the first to report that\nembryonic cells were taken directly down a desired lineage by\nmanipulation with growth factors.\n\n   An expected advantage of stem cell therapy is that it is not\nnecessary or even desirable to take cells to their fully\ndifferentiated or adult form. They need to be immature cells,\nappropriate for the tissue into which they are injected but young\nenough to respond to the local cues under which they will continue\ntheir development.\n\n   ``The message coming out from a lot of different studies is that\nembryonic stem cells are very plastic,'' said an author of the\nScience article, Dr. Ronald D.G. McKay of the National Institutes\nof Health. ``You coax them a little bit, and they slip into these\nstates.''\n\n   Although Thomson and other researchers with private funds are\nfree to work on human embryonic stem cells, government-financed\nscientists cannot do so because Congress has prohibited federal\nfunds from being spent on research in which human embryos are\ndestroyed.
