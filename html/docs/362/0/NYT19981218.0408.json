(mk) \n By PAMELA MERCER   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI _ At least eight people were killed late Thursday night\nwhen a pleasure boat carrying 26 Cubans capsized off one of the\nkeys that make up Biscayne National Park, Coast Guard officials\nsaid Friday. The officials described the incident as a probable\ncase of immigrant smuggling.\n\n   Coast Guard and immigration officials could not recall a recent\nincident in which a boat taking refugees across the Straits of\nFlorida had caused so many deaths. Nine people were also reported\nmissing.\n\n   The vessel, about 30 feet long, capsized about 11 p.m. on\nThursday, Coast Guard spokesmen said, some 20 miles south of Miami\nnear Elliott Key. A passing freighter noticed the capsizing Friday\nmorning and rescued seven passengers, including two children, who\nhad been clinging to the boat for about 10 hours, authorities said.\n\n   The dead passengers were discovered later in the vicinity by a\nCoast Guard rescue team. Using two cutters and three helicopters,\nthe Coast Guard members searched for the remaining passengers.\n\n   ``We believe it is a case of smuggling,'' said Jibran Soto, a\nCoast Guard spokesman.\n\n   The boat was registered with Florida plates and was likely used\nto bring Cubans to the country illegally, Soto added.\n\n   The incident comes as law-enforcement officials have encountered\na growing number of cases involving smugglers trying to bring Cuban\nand Haitian refugees into the United States. But it was not\nimmediately clear whether the group whose boat capsized Friday had\nbeen organized by a smuggler.\n\n   The site of Friday's capsizing, the shallow flats south of Key\nBiscayne, an island neighborhood of greater Miami, holds normally\ntranquil waters where recreational boats are a common sight. Though\nmore illegal immigrants try to reach Florida during the summer\nmonths than in December, the weather has been warm with mild winds.\n\n   But navigating the waters from Cuba has often been a deadly trip\nfor immigrants trying to leave the island, said Jose Basulto, who\nheads Brothers to the Rescue, a group that seeks to rescue Cubans\nand other refugees stranded along the Florida straits. ``We try to\ntell our brothers in Cuba not to do this because it's costing too\nmany lives,'' he added.\n\n   In a similar incident in March, three people died when a boat\nbelieved to carry 16 refugees capsized off Biscayne Bay. Two people\nwere later charged with smuggling.\n\n   President Clinton began ordering the deportation of Cuban boat\npeople in May 1995 after a huge influx of Cubans by sea. This\nrepresented a radical change from a 35-year policy of welcoming all\nthose leaving Cuba. Since the new policy has been in place, those\nspotted in the water are more likely to be deported than those who\nmake it to shore.\n\n   So far this year, almost 1,000 Cubans trying to enter the United\nStates have been picked up by Coast Guard patrols.\n","Headline":"\nAT LEAST 8 KILLED IN CAPSIZING OF SUSPECTED SMUGGLING BOAT \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI _ At least eight people were killed late Thursday night\nwhen a pleasure boat carrying 26 Cubans capsized off one of the\nkeys that make up Biscayne National Park, Coast Guard officials\nsaid Friday.
