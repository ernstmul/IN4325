The same public\nservice announcements, which focus on the dangers of paying\nsmugglers, known in Latin America as coyotes and in China as\nsnakeheads, have aired on Spanish-language TV programs broadcast in\nstates where large numbers of Latinos reside.\n\n   Later this month, new public service announcements produced for\nthe first time in collaboration with the Mexican government are\nscheduled to appear on 91 TV stations and 1,300 radio stations\nacross Mexico.\n\n   INS critics blame tougher enforcement for forcing migrants into\nmore isolated and dangerous parts of the desert and mountain\npasses, but even they agree the public service announcements could\nsave lives.\n\n   When INS Commissioner Doris Meissner visited China two weeks ago\nin a bid for anti-smuggling cooperation, she carried with her\nposters the service would like the Chinese government to display.\n\n   Numerous high-profile incidents in recent years are proof that\nthe public service announcements are not just scare tactics. Last\nmonth, the bodies of 58 Chinese immigrants were found aboard a\ntruck entering England, and last year eight migrants died after\nbeing caught in a freak snowstorm while crossing mountains outside\nSan Diego.\n\n   ``Human smuggling is a nightmare. Don't mistakenly get involved\nin it,'' one of the posters for use in China states. It goes on in\npoetic Mandarin: ``A stormy journey. By the time you reach the\nshore you are near death. Then everyone is sent back immediately.''\n\n   A poster destined for use in Latin America shows a funeral and\nwarns: ``Your brother trusted coyotes. Don't risk your life.''\n\n   INS officials in Washington concede that public education alone\nwill not stop the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants\nstreaming into the country each year.\n\n   ``I'm not sure of the size of the impact,'' one INS agent\nstationed in the Caribbean said. ``I go out with the local Navy and\ninterview these people after they are picked up, and they tell me,\n`Tomorrow, I'll get on another boat.'''\n\n   But both the INS and its critics in the immigrant advocacy\ncommunity agree that the public service announcements could save\nlives.\n\n   ``I think it represents a response to the extraordinary loss of\nlife,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy at the\nNational Council of La Raza, one of the nation's most influential\nLatino advocacy groups. ``It's important that the U.S. and Mexican\ngovernments respond.''\n\n   Omar de la Torre, minister for migration affairs in the Mexican\nEmbassy in Washington, said the announcements may serve to educate\nsome Mexicans and Central Americans to the dangers they face.\n\n   ``People who live in rural areas far from the border cannot\nimagine how it is,'' de la Torre said. ``They live in places where\nthe temperature is comfortable and the land is easy.''\n\n   The Chinese government also has shown increasing interest in\ncombating smuggling.
