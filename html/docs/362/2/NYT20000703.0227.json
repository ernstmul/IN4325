Times News Service   \n\n   BEIJING _ The head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization\nService held talks here Monday with Chinese officials, hoping to\nget ``a commitment for more international cooperation'' in the\nagency's effort to stem the huge flow of illegal Chinese immigrants\ninto the U.S.\n\n   The visit, planned months ago, came just weeks after 58 Chinese\nimmigrants suffocated while being smuggled into England in the back\nof a truck.\n\n   ``We've gotten cooperation, but it's been on a case-by-case\nbasis,'' said the head of the immigration service, Doris Meissner.\n``But we'd like to see better cooperation not just from China but\nalso from transit countries as well.'' Most illegal Chinese\nimmigrants arrive in the U.S. via a third country, where they often\nobtain fake travel documents.\n\n   Meissner said the United States had been ``quite successful'' in\nsome areas, such as slowing the number of illegal migrants who\narrive by boat. But she added that the international smuggling\nrings that help Chinese sneak into the U.S. have been quick to\nadapt, often creating new problems. She noted that as boat traffic\nhad dropped off, the number of illegal migrants arriving by air\nwith counterfeit documents had increased.\n\n   She said that the service estimated it would intercept and send\nback 4,000 Chinese arriving illegally at U.S. airports this year,\nwith many landing in Los Angeles, Seattle and New York.\n\n   Meissner's 14-member delegation, which includes top immigration\nofficials from those cities, will also visit the Fuzhou region of\nFujian Province, the home to the vast majority of Chinese who now\nlive illegally in the United States.\n\n   The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that tens\nof thousands of Chinese are smuggled into the U.S. each year,\nalthough Meissner said, ``We really don't have a good count.''\n\n   Many western governments that are trying to thwart the trade say\nthat international criminal gangs are making huge profits in this\nillegal human trade.\n\n   ``The amounts of money that go into this and the level of\norganization and the level of criminality and abuse puts Chinese\nsmuggling in a class by itself,'' Meissner said.\n\n   Meissner said that one of the most effective weapons against the\nillegal trade was the quick return of those who are intercepted.\nThat is ``the strongest signal that can be sent that taking the\nrisk and paying the money will not pay off,'' she said.\n\n   But quick repatriation is often not possible in the case of the\nChinese, since many apply for political asylum, and those claims\ncan take years to work their way through the system.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Although Chinese officials have said that the United States'\nrelatively liberal political asylum process had encouraged poor\nChinese to try their luck at emigration, Meissner said that\ncomplaint had not come up in meetings here.\n\n   She said that only about 13 percent of political asylum claims\nby Chinese are successful, generally made by people who say that\nthey will face political or religious persecution if they are\nreturned to the mainland.\n\n   But many illegal immigrants disappear into the vast Chinese\nnetworks in place in cities like New York before the asylum process\nis complete.\n\n   Meissner said Monday's talks were quite general, touching on an\narray of cooperative ventures.\n\n   ``We need to share analytic information, we need to work\ntogether on fraudulent document use, and on public information so\nthat accurate information is getting into the sending societies and\ncommunities,'' she said.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. AND CHINESE DISCUSS STEMMING FLOW OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS \n","Text":["\n   BEIJING _ The head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization\nService held talks here Monday with Chinese officials, hoping to\nget ``a commitment for more international cooperation'' in the\nagency's effort to stem the huge flow of illegal Chinese immigrants\ninto the U.S.\n","\n   The visit, planned months ago, came just weeks after 58 Chinese\nimmigrants suffocated while being smuggled into England in the back\nof a truck.\n","\n   ``We've gotten cooperation, but it's been on a case-by-case\nbasis,'' said the head of the immigration service, Doris Meissner.\n``But we'd like to see better cooperation not just from China but\nalso from transit countries as well.''
