Times News Service    \n\n   Now Comes the Real Revolution\n\n   On the annual Woman's Day in Iran last week, a conservative\nbureaucrat named Farah Khosravi announced that she wanted to run\nfor president in next year's election.\n\n   Women make up 25 percent of Iran's labor force and half of the\nuniversity population. They drive their own cars and run their own\nbusinesses, vote in elections and hold political office. So why not\na woman president?\n\n   In fact, Khosravi, who is 41 years old and is in charge of the\nexercise curriculum for Iran's schools, is not the first woman to\nexpress such ambitions.\n\n   During her successful campaign for Parliament in 1996, Faezeh\nHashemi, the daughter of then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi\nRafsanjani, declared that there was no reason under Iran's\nconstitution why a woman could not run for president. Her musings\nfueled speculation that she might seek the office, but she\neventually said she was just trying to stir things up.\n\n   The issue was picked up the following year by Azam Taleghani,\nthe daughter of the late Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani, a celebrated\ncleric who had been prominent in the Iranian revolution. She\nannounced her candidacy for president. Taleghani had been elected\nto the revolution's first parliament and ran an outspoken (now\nbanned) weekly newspaper.\n\n   Her action forced a debate on Iran's constitution, which said\nthat only a rajol _ a person of consequence _ could run. In Arabic,\nthe concept is masculine, but Taleghani argued that in Persian its\nmeaning is not clear, and she asked the opinion of the religious\nscholars who drafted the 1979 constitution.\n\n   Some said that women could not become president; others said\nthey could; still others said they didn't know. One said that even\nhermaphrodites could be president.\n\n   In the end, the Guardian Council, which vets political\ncandidates, disqualified Taleghani, as it did all but 4 of 230\nwould-be candidates.\n\n   Still, Taleghani counted the ruling a victory. She was told she\ncouldn't run because she was not ``a religious and political\npersonality,'' not because she was a woman.\n\n   A Kiss for the Ages\n\n   First Al Gore planted a big one on his wife, Tipper, at the\nDemocratic convention, and the pollsters said it worked wonders\nwith women. So after Oprah Winfrey jokingly complained that Gore\nfailed to kiss her in a cheery appearance on her talk show, Gov.\nGeorge W. Bush delivered a strategic smooch to her cheek last week\nand declared that his favorite gift to his wife, Laura, was a kiss.\n\n   What's going on?\n\n   ``We've spilled our guts on everything,'' said the author and\ntelevision personality Barbara Howar. ``We may as well show our\ntonsils.''\n\n   Who's to blame? As with so much in American politics, Bill\nClinton is the leading suspect. For two terms, Clinton has made his\nfamily's domestic turmoil successful grist for the political mill,\nfrom his mother's battles with his alcoholic stepfather to his own\nquest for spiritual renewal after an adulterous affair. He and his\nwife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were also accused of cynically\nallowing photographers to capture them dancing in bathing suits\njust weeks before word of Clinton's affair with a White House\nintern became public.\n\n   So the attention to this year's crop of kisses has everything to\ndo with last year's loves. However sincere or spontaneous the\nGores' embrace (which lasted from four to seven seconds, depending\non how much of the hug is counted), it seemed to stand in stark\ncontrast to Clinton's marital complications. Ditto Bush's\nendorsement of spousal smacking.\n\n   ``Maybe we'll have a pucker-ometer here pretty soon that will\nhelp us gauge our candidates,'' said Dayton Duncan, who was press\nsecretary to Gov. Michael Dukakis during his 1988 presidential\ncampaign. Duncan seems to find it all a bit mystifying. ``In my\nhigh school, in Indianola, Iowa, the people who were known as good\nkissers, everybody knew who they were,'' he said. ``And sometimes\nthat was good, and sometimes that was bad.''\n\n   A Billion Consumers Live In China. Next Question?\n\n   In a major triumph for the Clinton administration and American\nbusiness, the Senate cast a bipartisan vote to remove trade\nrestraints and expand commerce with China, the world's most\npopulous nation.\n\n   After an often tumultuous nine-month battle, the actual vote was\nslightly anticlimactic, and passed with minimal debate, 83-15.\nCoupled with approval by the House in May, the vote ends the annual\ncongressional review of China's trade status, a Capitol Hill ritual\nfor 20 years that Beijing considered degrading but that critics\ncontended was necessary to force China to improve its record on\nhuman rights and religious freedom.  \n\n   Gone, but Not Forgotten\n\n   Robert W. Ray, the independent prosecutor, ended a six-year,\nalmost $60 million investigation by delivering a report that\ncleared both President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham\nClinton, of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the Whitewater\nreal estate deal.\n\n   The failed Arkansas real estate venture was the beginning of an\ninquiry that broadened into wholly unexpected areas, including\nClinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky,\nwhich led to the impeachment drama in Congress.\n\n   Ray's conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence ``to\nprove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt'' that or Clinton\ncommitted any crimes, though Clinton could still be indicted after\nleaving office over his sworn statements in connection with his\nrelationship with Lewinsky.\n\n   Athletic Oddities in Sydney\n\n   The Olympics began to look a little like a soap opera, which\ncould only boost NBC's anemic ratings.\n\n   First, the French runn Marie-Jose Perec, the defending champion\nin the women's 200 and 400 meters, said she would not compete and\nflew to Singapore. Perec claimed to have been threatened by a man\nwho forced his way into her Sydney hotel room, but Australian\nnewspapers gleefully claimed she was running away from a showdown\nin the 400 meters with Australian Cathy Freeman. One labeled her\n``Mademoiselle La Chicken.''\n\n   Next, for the first time in memory, technicians set the vault\napparatus at the wrong height for the women's gymnastics, causing\nRussia's Svetlana Khorkina, then leading in the overall\nchampionship competition, to fall. She later fell from the uneven\nbars as well and, with her chance of a medal gone, refused to vault\nonce more on the readjusted piece of equipment. Afterward, she\nangrily told reporters to ``get lost.''\n\n   nn\n\n    \n\n   What Price Power?\n\n   After 10 years in power, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru\nfaced his most serious challenge, but after several days of\nuncertainty appeared to have beaten back the threat.\n\n   Fujimori announced new elections and the dissolution of the\nnational intelligence service after a damaging bribery episode came\nto light. His spy chief, implicated in the scandal, dropped from\nsight, and opposition groups called for Fujimori's immediate\nresignation. On Thursday, a statement of support from the armed\nforces solidified his position even if it left the price extracted\nby the military and the fate of the intelligence boss unclear.\n\n   Whitewashing History\n\n   A billionaire homebuilder from the West Coast is giving the\nSmithsonian Institution $80 million _ its largest donation ever _\nto modernize the National Museum of American History.\n\n   Officials at the federally financed museum welcomed the chance\nto replace displays, some of which are two decades old. Kenneth E.\nBehring, 72, gave $20 million to the Smithsonian's natural history\nmuseum in 1997.\n\n   Quitting While He's Ahead\n\n   When he was appointed the top antitrust cop at the Justice\nDepartment, Joel Klein was sharply criticized for being too soft,\nparticularly on telecommunications mergers.\n\n   ``We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over and plays\ndead,'' Senator Ernest Hollings said at the time.\n\n   Bill Gates would probably disagree.\n\n   Klein has now announced his intention to resign, after compiling\na formidable prosecutorial record that included the order to break\nup Microsoft Corp., the dissolution of a global vitamin cartel and\nthe compilation of a list of proposed corporate mergers that were\nabandoned or restructured after the government's antitrust\nobjections.   \n\n   Taste Funny to You?\n\n   Complaints, complaints everywhere _ but New York City police\ninvestigators said there was no evidence that anyone was tampering\nwith the bottled water sold in the city.\n\n   The deluge began with three initial complaints, in which ammonia\nand a lye-type cleaning agent were found in three water samples.\nThe police were leaning toward a theory that all three were\naccidents, in which cleaning supplies had somehow come in contact\nwith bottles.\n\n   Dozens of complaints had been filed after the first incidents\nwere reported, but investigators said they viewed them as the\nproducts of fear, fantasy and flimflam.\n\n   Trading in Human Lives\n\n   Federal prosecutors accused Robert E. Porges, a New York lawyer\nwhose Chinatown firm has represented thousands of Chinese\nimmigrants seeking political asylum in the United States, of\nparticipating in the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the\ncountry from China.\n\n   The Porges firm, with roughly 40 lawyers and paralegals, was\nalso accused of helping smugglers, also known as snakeheads, to\n``abduct'' illegal immigrants and of falsifying the applications of\nsome 6,000 asylum seekers, who paid the firm a total of $12\nmillion. Porges' wife, Sheery Lu Porges, is accused of helping\nsmugglers kidnap 17 Chinese immigrants since 1997.\n\n   The Porgeses and five of their employees pleaded not guilty to\nall the charges, including racketeering, conspiracy and immigration\nfraud.\n\n   Now, the Navigator\n\n   The scandal over defective Firestone tires prompted Congress to\napprove money for rating vehicles' tendency to roll over. This\nfollows evidence that most of the 103 deaths blamed on defective\ntires occurred in Ford Explorers that flipped over when their tires\nlost their treads.\n\n   Meanwhile, another tire maker, Continental, recalled 160,000\ntires mounted mostly on Ford's Lincoln Navigator sport utility\nvehicle, while regulators began studying whether an Explorer front\nsuspension component was prone to defects.\n\n   Ford said that neither the Continental tires nor the suspension\ncomponent had caused any serious crashes.\n","Headline":"\nNEWS OF THE WEEK IN REVIEW \n","Text":["\n   Now Comes the Real Revolution\n","\n   On the annual Woman's Day in Iran last week, a conservative\nbureaucrat named Farah Khosravi announced that she wanted to run\nfor president in next year's election.\n","\n   Women make up 25 percent of Iran's labor force and half of the\nuniversity population.
