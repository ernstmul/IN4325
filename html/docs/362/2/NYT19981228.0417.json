Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI _ Eighty-two illegal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti and\nJamaica were dropped off at eight locations between Key West and\nWest Palm Beach over the last three days in a flurry of smuggling\nthat takes a page from the drug trafficking in the seas off South\nFlorida, federal officials said Monday.\n\n   Among the 82 illegal immigrants detained over the weekend were\n46 Cubans, 30 Haitians and six Jamaicans, including 12 minors,\nofficials said. One group of 18 Cubans landed on the shore in Miami\nBeach's trendy South Beach section.\n\n   U.S. Border Patrol officials said organized alien smugglers\nusing high-powered speedboats were believed to be involved in all\nbut one of the incidents, the highest number of landings the Border\nPatrol has seen in a 72-hour period.

Of 21\npending federal prosecutions of alien smugglers in South Florida,\nRoberts said, at least six cases involve defendants also connected\nto drug trafficking.\n\n   Although the Border Patrol, which handles the illegal immigrants\nwho make it to shore, had no year-end figures available, the U.S.\nCoast Guard, which handles those caught at sea, reports a doubling\nin the number of immigrant interceptions from last year. So far in\n1998, 998 Cubans and 1,345 Haitians have been intercepted at sea,\ncompared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 1997.\n\n   A Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Jeff Murphy, said one\ntheory for the rise, which was registered mostly in the second half\nof the year, was that because of hurricane destruction in the\nCaribbean, ``more and more people might be willing to risk it all''\nand leave for the United States. Still, the numbers are far below\ntheir crisis proportions in 1994, when more than 37,000 Cubans and\n24,000 Haitians crossed the Florida Straits.\n\n   Since then, the United States, which used to indiscriminately\nwelcome those escaping Fidel Castro's Cuba, repatriates Cubans\nfound at sea, just as it does Haitians and others. Those who make\nit to land, however, are less likely to be deported, and many\nCubans still attempt the crossing. Increasingly, they have resorted\nto smugglers with boats better equipped for the journey.\n\n   ``In 1994, it was anything that would float,'' Murphy said.\n``We're seeing more and more sophistication in their approach.''\n\n   But the smuggling fee _ which Border Patrol officials said\naverages about $1,500 but can reach $8,000 or higher _ does not\nguarantee a safe passage.
