Times News Service   \n\n   SEATTLE _ Accommodations for the 15-day trip from Hong Kong were\na metal cargo container, covered by canvas and stacked atop several\nother such tractor-trailer-size boxes in the hold of a giant\nfreighter called the Cape May. The only light was from flashlights.\nHuman waste was deposited in buckets. Food, primarily boxes of\nvegetables, ran out at some point. The seas were particularly\nrough.\n\n   When the Cape May pulled into Seattle and the containers were\ntaken off late Monday afternoon, 15 men from China stumbled out of\nthe metal box, dazed, dehydrated and gravely hungry. The stowaways,\nillegal immigrants who had agreed to pay tens of thousands of\ndollars in future wages to smugglers, pointed to the garbage-strewn\ncontainer, indicating even grimmer news. Inside were the bodies of\nthree men who had died during the crossing.\n\n   ``These containers were designed to carry machinery and cargo _\nnot people,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service. ``The people aboard the Cape May were\neffectively entombed.''\n\n   At least 10 times in recent weeks, officials at ports on the\nwest coast of the United States and Canada have found human beings\nin cargo containers, a reflection of an alarming new trend in\nsmuggling that has now turned deadly and of the extraordinary steps\nthat Chinese laborers are willing to take to reach North America\nand the jobs they are promised here.\n\n   There are almost certainly more instances in which such\ntravelers have managed to make it across without detection, as some\nfreighters carry 1,000 containers or more. There is no question\nthat more such human-laden boxes are on the way, officials say. At\n5 a.m. Tuesday, another 19 Chinese men, all relatively young and in\napparent good health, were discovered in a cargo container aboard\nthe Hanjin Yokohma, which had also sailed from Hong Kong.\n\n   With American and Canadian officials expressing shock at the\nrecent discoveries, Hong Kong authorities pledged a crackdown\nTuesday on the illegal trafficking, which has been detected so far\nin freighters arriving here and in Long Beach, Calif., and\nVancouver, B.C. Conditions in the containers vary widely: some,\nwith ventilation punched through the canvas tops and with furniture\nand electric heaters and lights, seem to be somewhat endurable. But\nin other cases, particularly aboard the Cape May, they are\nnightmarish.\n\n   Said Bob Coleman, the acting director of the immigration service\nin Seattle, of the Cape May stowaways: ``I've simply never seen\npeople so disoriented, so distraught.''\n\n   It is not clear yet whether the three dead people aboard the\nfreighter perished from exposure to the cold in their unheated\ncontainers, lack of water, or perhaps a combination of the two,\nofficials said Tuesday.\n\n   Of the 15 who survived the journey in the 40-foot-long, 8-foot\nwide metal box, seven remain in Harborview Medical Center in\nsatisfactory condition, all being treated for dehydration or\nmalnutrition, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for the hospital. Eight\nothers, able to eat solid food, were released Tuesday into the\ncustody of the immigration service.\n\n   Under American immigration laws, unless they can establish a\nwell-grounded fear of persecution in their native country, the\nstowaways will likely be deported to China in weeks. In recent\ndays, U. S. authorities have repatriated at least 246 recent\nstowaways to China, some who arrived in containers and others\nelsewhere on ships.\n\n   American officials hope that word of the repatriations may deter\nothers from making the hazardous journeys, but such actions have\nhardly stemmed the tide in the past. As unemployment increases in\nChina and the demand for cheap labor continues in this country,\nsome experts think it will only increase.\n\n   The immigrants found in the last couple of weeks are not the\nfirst on record to make the crossing in dark, cramped metal\ncontainers, but there has never before been such a rash of\ncrossings discovered. Why it is occurring now is not certain,\nalthough Irene Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the immigration\nservice, said it might be a response to crackdowns on smuggling.\n\n   ``I certainly couldn't speak for the smugglers, but it seems\nit's simply a new avenue that they've tried to open recently,'' she\nsaid. ``When one method doesn't work so well, they try something\nnew. That goes for drug smuggling or human smuggling. And if this\ndoesn't work so well, they'll try some other way.''\n\n   In most cases, she said, officials do not believe that the\nshipping companies are knowing accomplices. The crew may make the\nentire crossing without having any reason to know that people are\nin the containers stacked in the hold. In the case of the Cape May,\nno action has been taken against the officers or crew.\n\n   As awful as the containers' conditions can be, it is not clear\nthat the journey inside them is any more dangerous than those in\nwhich hundreds of people are crammed aboard older ships that travel\nat much slower speeds, sometimes taking two months or more to cross\nthe Pacific.\n\n   But it is hard to imagine anything worse than the crossing of\nthose in the Cape May container. In Washington, Ken Elwood, deputy\nexecutive associate commissioner of field operations with the\nimmigration service, said there was something particularly\nappalling about the case: the discovery of irregular rips in the\ncanvas top and other evidence that at least some of the occupants\nhad frantically tried to escape the container, but in vain.\n\n   ``Psychologically this had to be terrible,'' Elwood said.\n``Evidently they had tried desperately to tear the top off the\ncontainer and get out. It's horrific to think what happened to\nthose people.''\n","Headline":"\nCARGO CONTAINERS HELD HUMAN CARGO _ CHINESE STOWAWAYS \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Accommodations for the 15-day trip from Hong Kong were\na metal cargo container, covered by canvas and stacked atop several\nother such tractor-trailer-size boxes in the hold of a giant\nfreighter called the Cape May.
