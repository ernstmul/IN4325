Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents have cracked an international ring\nthat made hundreds of millions of dollars smuggling thousands of\nIndians and other Asians into the United States over the last three\nyears, the government announced Friday.\n\n   The smugglers filled orders from small businesses looking for\nworkers, the government said. The businesses or the immigrants'\nfamilies typically paid $20,000 or more for each of those smuggled,\nwho made ``long, grueling trips fraught with danger'' that often\ntook months, said Paul Coggins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, who is the\nlead prosecutor in the case.\n\n   Once in the United States, some immigrants were kept as virtual\ncaptives by employers or the smugglers until the debt was paid, the\nofficials said.\n\n   ``This is the largest alien smuggling organization ever\ndismantled in United States history,'' Attorney General Janet Reno\nsaid at a news conference here.\n\n   In three indictments unsealed in Dallas Friday, 31 people were\ncharged with bringing illegal aliens into the United States,\ntransporting them within the United States, conspiracy and money\nlaundering.\n\n   Twenty-one of those indicted, including two of the three men\nidentified as leaders of the ring, were seized in arrests that\nbegan last Saturday and lasted through Thursday, in the Bahamas,\nPuerto Rico and several cities across the United States. The rest\nare at large.\n\n   The ring brought about 300 people a month, and as many as 12,000\nover three years, into the United States, said Doris Meissner,\ncommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some of\nthose undocumented workers, almost all adult men, have been found\nand are being held as witnesses, officials said.\n\n   This is how the smuggling operation worked, the officials said:\n\n   The ring leaders solicited orders from families in the United\nStates and employers who were prepared to pay for illegal aliens.\nThe people they helped bring to the United States were mostly\nIndians, but some were from Pakistan, Syria or Afghanistan. In many\ncases, they were provided false passports and other documents.\n\n   From India, the people were taken to Moscow and then to Cuba.\nFrom Cuba, the officials said, some workers were taken to the\nBahamas and then to Miami. Others were taken from Cuba to Ecuador\nand then to Miami or across the Mexican border into the United\nStates.\n\n   They arrived by air, land and sea.\n\n   The money raised from the smuggling enterprise was shipped from\nthe United States to India through Canada, Dubai and the United\nArab Emirates.\n\n   One of the secret houses where the immigrants were held was in\nMiami. Another was in northern New Jersey. Most of the immigrants\nended up on the East Coast, but some have been identified in 38\nstates.\n\n   One of the stash houses was located in New Jersey, and for a\nperiod beginning last May, four members of the ring held 22 illegal\naliens there until a smuggling fee of $14,000 was paid for each,\naccording to a separate federal indictment that was unsealed in\nNewark Friday.\n\n   The indictment said the four set up the house and collected\nsmuggling fees of over $300,000. The indictment, announced by the\nU.S. attorney for New Jersey, Faith Hochberg, charged them with\nconspiracy and harboring illegal aliens.\n\n   The indictment did not disclose the location of the stash house.\nBut it said some of the four suspects' illegal planning and acts\ntook place in Hudson County.\n\n   Only one of the four has been arrested. He was identified as\nPankaj Brahmbhatt, of Union City, N.J. The three at large were\nidentified as Manish Patel, Nilesh Mistry, and Amrish Patel, of\nJersey City.\n\n   The officials in Washington refused to say what kind of\nbusinesses sought the immigrants. They said the investigation was\nstill under way and that they expected to arrest the owners of some\nof these businesses.\n\n   The businesses employing the smuggled immigrants were primarily\nin the service industries, especially fast food, according to one\nImmigration and Naturalization official who did not want to be\nidentified for fear of impeding the investigation. He said the\nsmuggling appears to have been arranged by fast food restaurant\nowners and franchisees, rather than larger corporations. ``There is\nno indication that any parent companies were aware of or involved\nin that type of activity,'' he said.\n\n   As Coggins described it, the investigation began about a year\nago when some of the smuggled immigrants were arrested in Dallas.\nWith ample highways and one of the nation's largest airports,\nDallas became a major transshipment point. ``All the same factors\nthat make Dallas a great city of legitimate trade make Dallas a\ngreat city for illegitimate trade,'' he said. ``It's a lot like a\ndrug cartel, except they substituted people for drugs.''\n\n   He said the indictments would spin off hundreds of other\ninvestigations into the businesses that employed the workers.\n\n   Ms. Meissner estimated that the ring collected about $220\nmillion over three years. The investigation, called Operation Seek\nand Keep, lasted a year, she said.\n\n   ``Operation Seek and Keep is an important landmark in the\nadministration's goal of protecting authorized workers in the\nUnited States and putting unscrupulous employers out of business,''\nshe said at the news conference.\n\n   Still, the 300 illegal immigrants a month brought in by the\nsmuggling ring is a tiny fraction of the number that illegally\ncrosses the Mexican border into the United States every week.\n\n   The ring involved three overlapping but competing cartels, the\nofficials said. They said that the head of one of these\norganizations, Nick Diaz, who is also known as Nitin Shettie, was\narrested in the Bahamas last Saturday and was in custody in Miami.\nHe was said to be 30 years old and a resident of the Bahamas and\nEcuador.\n\n   Another man said to be a top leader, Navtej Pall Singh Sandhu,\nwas arrested in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday. He was said to\nbe 40 years old and a resident of London.\n\n   The alleged leader of the third organization, Niranjan Maan\nSingh, was said to be 58 years old and at large in India.\n\n   Other arrests were made at LaGuardia Airport and on Staten\nIsland; in North Bergen, Somerset and Perth Amboy, N.J., and in\nFlorida, California, Texas and Pennsylvania.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. CRACKS MAJOR ALIEN-SMUGGLING RING \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents have cracked an international ring\nthat made hundreds of millions of dollars smuggling thousands of\nIndians and other Asians into the United States over the last three\nyears, the government announced Friday.\n","\n   The smugglers filled orders from small businesses looking for\nworkers, the government said.
