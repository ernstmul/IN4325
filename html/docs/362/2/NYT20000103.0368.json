The same firm, Lap Kei Trading Co. of Hong Kong,\nshipped the container carrying Chinese immigrants on the OOCL Faith\nand shipped two containers that arrived in Los Angeles on Dec. 28.\n\n   INS agents n Los Angeles detained 30 illegal immigrants from\nChina. They had crossed the Pacific in containers on two different\nships.\n\n   Mark Steele, an INS agent, also wrote in court documents that\nLap Kei Trading shipped two containers with Chinese stowaways that\nare expected to arrive Tuesday at Seattle's Terminal 18, presumably\naboard the California Jupiter. Steele's affidavit identifies that\nship as being suspected of having stowaways aboard.\n\n   Neither the INS nor the U.S. Coast Guard would provide further\ninformation about the California Jupiter.\n\n   According to computerized tracking information, the California\nJupiter left Hong Kong on Dec. 20, arrived in Vancouver, B.C., on\nSunday, and left Vancouver at noon yesterday bound for Seattle.\n\n   The INS in Seattle learned about the California Jupiter and OOCL\nFaith last Thursday, according to court documents. A fax from an\nINS office in Hong Kong alerted Seattle agents to possible\nstowaways in containers on the California Jupiter and OOCL Faith.\n\n   Such smuggling operations have occurred regularly on the West\nCoast over the last year. The first known smuggling of illegal\nimmigrants in a container occurred April 7, 1998, in Tacoma, INS\nspokeswoman Kice said.\n\n   Two others have since occurred in Tacoma; four in Los Angeles.\n\n   ``This is part of a troubling trend,'' Kice said. ``Some of\nthese ships have over 1,000 containers. It is, in a sense, like\nlooking for a needle in a haystack.''\n\n   The Faith, owned by Orient Overseas Container Line, can carry\nnearly 1,800 freight containers and intended to unload several\nhundred in Seattle before heading for Vancouver.\n\n   But on Sunday, INS agents found the ``needle'' they were looking\nfor in both California and Washington.\n\n   When a cargo ship arrived in Long Beach, agents found 18\nstowaways _ all Chinese nationals _ in a container.\n\n   In Seattle, INS agents waited as the OOCL Faith arrived at 5:30\na.m. Agents knew the number of the container they wanted to see,\nfound it and had it loaded off the ship, according to court\ndocuments.\n\n   They found 12 Chinese men inside.\n\n   Conditions inside the container were filthy, INS officials said.\nThe ship left Hong Kong around Dec. 19, stopped in Kobe, Japan,\nthen headed across the Pacific for Seattle.\n\n   ``This is an international smuggling operation,'' said Bob\nColeman, acting director of the INS in Seattle. ``There are usually\nlights. There's food and water, and there's ventilation. It's not\nlike they're just put in there. There's some thought that has gone\ninto sustaining them in the voyage.''\n\n   In the canvas-covered container, the Chinese men had food as\nwell as lights, and a fan operated by car batteries. The men slept\non small mattresses, Coleman said.\n\n   They used buckets for toilets and apparently tried to use\nchemicals to break down their waste. Coleman said the container had\na strong order of camphor and that the first agents in the\ncontainer wore suits to protect them from possible hazardous\nmaterials.\n\n   Coleman said he suspects that the 12 men agreed to pay around\n$40,000 apiece to get to the United States. The money would be paid\nlater by their families in China and the men, some of whom could be\nsubjected to something akin to indentured servitude to pay off\ntheir debt.\n\n   ``I don't think these are random things,'' Coleman said. ``Alien\nsmuggling is as sophisticated as drug smuggling. There is a lot of\nmoney to be made. Because of our economy, a lot of people are drawn\nhere.''\n\n   The dozen men, believed to be in good health, likely will face\ndeportation.\n\n   In the last year, the Canadian navy seized four ships trying to\nsmuggled 600 Chinese immigrants into British Columbia. Almost all\nof the immigrants intended to end up in New York.\n\n   Immigrant smuggling is often associated with Fujian province in\nChina. Fujian has a long history of smuggling, federal agents say.\nIt is just across the Strait of Taiwan from Taiwan.\n\n   Typically, the INS ends up arresting only the smuggled\nimmigrants, not the smugglers. But not on Sunday.\n\n   About an hour after agents searched the container, a Chevrolet\nAstro Van drove on Habor Island toward Terminal 18. Its driver\nseemed lost and told a federal agent that he was looking for\nChinatown.\n\n   The driver and his two passengers were the three Chinese men\ncharged Monday. One carried a New York driver's license. Another a\nmap of Seattle with Terminal 18 marked in ink.\n\n   At a hotel room the three men shared, agents found a bill of\nlading for two containers expected to arrive in Seattle Tuesday.\n\n   Two of the men are in the United States illegally, according to\nfederal officials.
