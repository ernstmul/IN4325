Times News Service   \n\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ It was an odyssey, he said, that began more\nthan a year ago, when he was forced to leave a coastal village in\nChina for political reasons, and ended two weeks ago when what he\nhoped would be his boat to freedom ran aground on the Jersey Shore.\n\n   In between, he said, was a desperate, often difficult passage\nthat included a prolonged, lonely stay in a humid country in South\nAmerica and an unpleasant voyage aboard a large, rickety ship with\nabout 200 other Chinese men bobbing through the rough Atlantic\nOcean.\n\n   ``It's been very difficult,'' said the man, 25, who spoke on the\ncondition that his name not be used. ``I am lonely.''\n\n   The man is one of 23 Chinese who tried to enter the United\nStates illegally on May 30 and are being held by the federal\nImmigration and Naturalization Service at a detention center here.\nThe immigrants' lawyers say that the men will seek political\nasylum; the immigration service, though, has begun deportation\nhearings and is moving swiftly.\n\n   Information about the 23 men, whose predicament recalls that of\nthe 286 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard the Golden Venture, a\nsmuggling ship that ran aground in Queens in 1993, has been sketchy\nto this point. But one of the 23 spoke briefly in an interview at\nthe detention center about why he did what he did, casting some\nlight on the conditions and hardships he and his fellow shipmates\nmay have endured.\n\n   During the voyage, the man said, food was scarce. Uncertainty,\nhowever, was plentiful: uncertainty about whether he would be able\nto repay the $20,000 to $30,000 debt his family had incurred to\nsend him to America, whether he would survive the trip, and whether\nhe would be caught and sent back to China, where his life, he said,\nwould be in danger.\n\n   ``I was forced to leave China for political reasons,'' the man\nsaid. ``I am afraid of being captured by the Communist Party.''\n\n   The immigration service is trying to determine whether his\naccount is genuine or the result of an effort to coach the man to\nsay things that might improve his chances of staying in the United\nStates. On Thursday and Friday, the 23 men made brief individual\nappearances before two immigration judges to determine whether they\nshould be released on bond. The hearings are scheduled to resume in\ntwo weeks.\n\n   One of the 23 Chinese men, Wang Wu Dong, was also aboard the\nGolden Venture in 1993. He failed to win asylum and was deported\nonly months before Congress passed a law in 1996 that would have\nstrengthened his case for asylum. Wang politely declined to offer\nany details recently, saying only, ``I've been through many\nhardships.'' He referred all matters to his lawyers at The Porges\nLaw Firm in Manhattan.\n\n   But the 25-year-old passenger who spoke on condition of\nanonymity did speak cautiously about his situation.\n\n   Speaking in Mandarin, the man said that he grew up in the small\nfarming community of Minjiangko, not far from the city of Fuzhou in\nFujian Province. He studied through middle school, then found work,\nfirst as a painter, later as a clerk at a sundries store.\n\n   ``I am worried about what might happen to me if I go back,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   He did say, though, that he was not married and that he was not\na practicing Christian or a member of the pro-democracy movement.\n\n   He said that his relatives arranged for his trip, paying about\n$20,000 to $30,000 to a smuggling group, and that he left home\nabout one year ago. He was flown to South America.\n\n   Earlier reports in the Chinese-language media have said that the\nmen flew to Suriname, in South America.\n\n   The 23, apparently, were not the only Chinese men who were in\nSouth America, waiting for an opportunity to sneak into the United\nStates, the man from Minjiangko said.\n\n   After waiting for what might have been the better part of a\nyear, the men finally left perhaps two or three months ago,\nboarding a big ship. There may have been 200 men, most of whom were\nfrom Fujian. But the man said he did not recognize a soul from his\nMinjiangko life, and he felt lonely, often.\n\n   The voyage was difficult: Sleep was but a dream, and food\nconsisted only of rice porridge. At some point, the bigger ship\ndischarged a group of about two dozen, who then transferred to a\nsmaller boat, the Oops II. But the Oops II lost its way in heavy\nfog and ran aground on the night of May 30 at Bay Head.\n\n   Last Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard took custody of a freighter\nintercepted about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island, and the\nauthorities have said it may have been a so-called mother ship used\nin the Oops II smuggling operation.\n\n   The man from Minjiangko said he hoped that he would be granted\nasylum. ``I've suffered a lot,'' he said. ``I don't want to go\nback.''\n","Headline":"\nSMUGGLED CHINESE IMMIGRANT DESCRIBES VOYAGE \n","Text":["\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ It was an odyssey, he said, that began more\nthan a year ago, when he was forced to leave a coastal village in\nChina for political reasons, and ended two weeks ago when what he\nhoped would be his boat to freedom ran aground on the Jersey Shore.\n","\n   In between, he said, was a desperate, often difficult passage\nthat included a prolonged, lonely stay in a humid country in South\nAmerica and an unpleasant voyage aboard a large, rickety ship with\nabout 200 other Chinese men bobbing through the rough Atlantic\nOcean.\n","\n   ``It's been very difficult,'' said the man, 25, who spoke on the\ncondition that his name not be used. ``I am lonely.''\n","\n   The man is one of 23 Chinese who tried to enter the United\nStates illegally on May 30 and are being held by the federal\nImmigration and Naturalization Service at a detention center here.\nThe immigrants' lawyers say that the men will seek political\nasylum; the immigration service, though, has begun deportation\nhearings and is moving swiftly.\n","\n   Information about the 23 men, whose predicament recalls that of\nthe 286 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard the Golden Venture, a\nsmuggling ship that ran aground in Queens in 1993, has been sketchy\nto this point.
