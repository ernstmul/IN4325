The stowaways, 51 of them between\nthe ages of 14 and 17, were on the ship for at least two weeks.\n\n   All of the people seized from the ship spent Thursday night at a\nNational Guard armory in Savannah.\n\n   Thomas Fischer, INS district director, said agency officials\nplan to interview the stowaways today and Sunday, hoping to\ndiscover their destination _ the ship was headed for Georgetown,\nS.C., after its scheduled stop in Savannah _ and whether an\nemployer awaited their arrival. The INS brought in agents from New\nYork who speak Chinese to help interrogate the detainees.\n\n   INS officials will decide whether to file charges against the\nship's crew members. Authorities had not charged anyone as of\nFriday night. The INS can legally detain the stowaways and crew\nmembers because they are in this country illegally, Fischer said.\n\n   He said Savannah is seen as a gateway to the United States for\nillegal immigrants, as are many seaports. Illegal immigration\nproblems in Savannah have not significantly worsened in the last\nfew years, he said, but they have not improved, either.\n\n   Congress ordered the INS last year to spend more money to help\nlocal law enforcement agencies crack down on illegal immigration in\n11 states that do not share a border with Canada or Mexico. Georgia\nis one of those states, and the INS identified four regions in\nwhich it plans to bolster its presence, including Savannah.\n\n   Smuggling Chinese nationals into the United States has become\nbig business in the last few years. Investigators say criminal\norganizations in China typically charge each passenger $30,000 to\n$47,000 for the trip, usually aboard a ship and very often in\nsqualid conditions where disease, rape and hunger can be rampant.\n\n   Michael Gilhooly, INS spokesman for 25 states in the eastern\nUnited States, said the agency intercepted 700 Chinese being\nsmuggled into this country in 1996. The number rose to 1,100 in\n1998, and 1,900 so far this year.\n\n   Most of the aliens come here for work, he said, but they often\nspend years repaying the debt they owe to smugglers.\n\n   Other recent interceptions:\n\n   _ In May 1998, 23 Chinese aliens waded ashore on an affluent New\nJersey beach after a small boat they were riding in ran out of\nfuel. INS agents found a much bigger boat in the waters nearby. The\ncaptain and his engineer were convicted of smuggling.\n\n   _ In September 1998, the INS discovered 174 Chinese nationals on\na ship near San Diego, Calif. The captain and four crew members\nwere convicted.\n\n   _ In December 1998, investigators charged 30 people in a scheme\nto smuggle 3,600 Chinese into New York City over a two-year period.\nOrganizers of that ring charged $47,000 a trip and made about $170\nmillion, Gilhooly said.\n\n   Most of the Chinese nationals who were detained in those cases\nare awaiting deportation. Gilhooly said an immigration judge\nreviews any requests for political asylum, but he did not know\nwhether such requests were made in the three 1998 cases.\n\n   ``The smugglers put human beings at risk,'' he said. ``The\nlinchpin in smuggling is that people are profiting from human\nmisery.''\n\n   Based on a tip two weeks ago, the U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday\nused a dog trained to sniff out humans in searching the Prince\nNicolas, a cargo ship from Cyprus owned by Cosmomar Shipping, when\nit was six miles off the coast. They found nothing suspicious,\nFischer said.\n\n   INS agents searched again after the ship docked. ``We had a\nsixth sense that something was wrong,'' Fischer said. On Thursday,\nofficials inspected the ship after it docked in Savannah and\ndiscovered a secret hatch that was welded shut to conceal the\nChinese immigrants.\n\n   The Chinese slept in bunks and had air conditioning, but they\nshared tight quarters and had to use a hole in the floor as a\nrestroom. ``This was not part of the Carnival cruise line,''\nFischer said.\n\n   The would-be immigrants were carrying large sums of American\nmoney, authorities said.\n\n   Fischer said the government probably will order medical\nexaminations to see whether any of the detainees have tuberculosis\nor other diseases that could be easily transmitted in a jail.
