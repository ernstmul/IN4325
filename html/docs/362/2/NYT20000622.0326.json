Times News Service   \n\n   DOVER, England _ The Dutch driver of a truck that became the\nsealed tomb of 58 illegal Chinese immigrants packed into its\nairtight container was charged on Thursday with manslaughter, the\npolice said.\n\n   A spokesman for the Kent police, Mark Pugash, said that the\ndriver, Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, will be arraigned on 58\ncharges of manslaughter, or unlawful killing, when he appears in\ncourt on Friday. The driver has been held since the corpses of the\nyoung immigrants were found early Monday in the rear of his truck.\n\n   Wacker was also charged with trying to bring the victims into\nthe country and with facilitating the entry into Britain of two\nsurvivors, who have been hospitalized and are being questioned by\nthe police. His truck had made a five-hour ferry crossing from the\nBelgian port of Zeebrugge in unseasonable heat.\n\n   The severity of the charges appeared to reflect the outrage in\nBritain and throughout the European Union over a case that has\nhighlighted the unease generated by immigration. European states\ncannot decide whether to view young immigrants as a burden or a\npotential benefit to their aging societies.\n\n   Because legal immigration into states of the European Union is\nalmost impossible for unskilled workers, and not easy even for the\nskilled, growing numbers are seeking illegal entry, most as asylum\nseekers.\n\n   This seems to have been the goal of the 60 Chinese people packed\nin the truck, most of whom were in their 20s and had apparently\ntraveled overland from China's southern Fujian Province, the police\nsaid.\n\n   ``The global reality now is that you cannot stop people from\npoorer countries aspiring for life in richer countries,'' said Tan\nWah-piow, a London lawyer who deals with asylum cases. ``That is\nwhat drives these people from Fujian. But people in European states\nare not ready to confront this reality.''\n\n   Tan has become involved because four days after the discovery of\nthe bodies, none of the victims has been identified. He said he was\noutraged by this failure and contended that it reflected the\nrefusal of British authorities to guarantee that any Chinese\nrelatives of the dead who come forward will be granted amnesty.\n\n   It appears that these relatives may themselves be in England\nillegally and are afraid to present themselves to the authorities\nfor fear of detention or even expulsion.\n\n   Those seeking asylum routinely destroy all their documents, so\nthe dead are thought to have had no identification on them.\n\n   Pugash hinted in a radio interview on Thursday that any\nrelatives would be treated with understanding, but he declined to\noffer any guarantees of immunity. ``We have said from the beginning\nthat we will welcome anyone with any information,'' he said. ``We\nwill treat them sympathetically. Asylum status is not an issue for\nus.''\n\n   Britain's Labor government, under pressure to stem a rising flow\nof immigration widely seen as placing unacceptable strain on the\nwelfare state, tightened its asylum laws earlier this year. In\n1999, more than 70,000 people applied for asylum, compared to about\n5,000 before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.\n\n   The Kent police have arrested two other people _ a Chinese man\nand woman _ in connection with the case. The Dutch police have\narrested Arie van der Spek, 24, who lived at the address listed for\nthe company registered as the owner the truck, and one other man.\n\n   The case has also acquired a Belgian dimension. The police there\nare holding three Asian men arrested in April in connection with\nthe illegal presence of a large group of Chinese immigrants in two\nvillages.\n\n   It is not yet clear whether these Chinese citizens, who were\ndetained by Belgian authorities and then put unescorted on a train\nto Antwerp, are the same group that later died in Wacker's truck.\nThe British police are examining fingerprints of the group made by\nthe Belgian police two months ago.\n\n   Relations between Belgium and Britain have been strained over\nthe way the Chinese were treated, with Belgian ministers curtly\nrebuffing British suggestions that the arrest and subsequent\nrelease of the group made little sense.\n\n   These bitter exchanges have illustrated the fact that the 15\nnations of the European Union have no common policy on immigration\nor asylum. Some, like Belgium and Germany, are members of the\nso-called ``Schengen area,'' a group of states that have\neffectively dismantled the borders between them. Others, like\nBritain, are not.\n\n   China on Thursday called for tighter controls on immigration,\nsuggesting some European countries were too lax. ``It is worth\nnoting that criminal groups usually use legal loopholes in some\ncountries to organize secret passages,'' said Zhu Bangzao, a\nforeign ministry spokesman. ``Countries concerned should coordinate\nefforts and crack down severely on these crimes.''\n","Headline":"\nBRITAIN CHARGES DUTCH TRUCK DRIVER IN IMMIGRANTS' DEATHS \n","Text":["\n   DOVER, England _ The Dutch driver of a truck that became the\nsealed tomb of 58 illegal Chinese immigrants packed into its\nairtight container was charged on Thursday with manslaughter, the\npolice said.\n","\n   A spokesman for the Kent police, Mark Pugash, said that the\ndriver, Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, will be arraigned on 58\ncharges of manslaughter, or unlawful killing, when he appears in\ncourt on Friday.
