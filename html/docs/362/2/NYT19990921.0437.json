They are believed to have paid smugglers about $38,000\napiece to be slipped into Canada after a long sea trip under\nprimitive conditions.\n\n   A fifth ship is believed to have unloaded its human cargo before\nit was spotted sinking south of the Queen Charlotte Islands early\nin July.\n\n   Canadian officials have been reluctant to explain how their\nCP-140 Aurora patrol aircraft have known where to spot boatloads of\nillegal Chinese along Canada's vast coastline.\n\n   ``It would give an advantage to people we are trying to\nintercept,'' said Lt. David McKinnon, a Canadian Navy spokesman.\n\n   But in fact, Canada and the United States are cooperating\nclosely in tracking the smuggling ships. It is a matter of great\ninterest to both nations _ Canada doesn't want a flood of illegal\nimmigrants, while the United States is concerned that many of them\nwill end up in the United States.\n\n   ``There is an ongoing agreement between the U.S. Navy and the\nCanadian Navy to foster cooperation in intelligence in that part of\nthe world,'' one U.S. Navy intelligence official said.\n\n   Another U.S. Navy official confirmed that the service _ along\nwith other U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies _ has\nbeen sharing information with the Canadians, although he declined\nto specify the source of the data or how it was shared, saying such\ninformation is classified.\n\n   The Canadians also decline to be specific.\n\n   ``In conjunction with our allies, we can be wherever we need to\nbe. We are working with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Department of\nDefense all the time,'' McKinnon said.\n\n   Such information-sharing is conducted in part through the\nNorthwest Regional Naval Intelligence Center at Whidbey Island\nNaval Air Station.\n\n   Since 1996, the center has operated at a heavily guarded\nfacility staffed by several hundred military intelligence\nspecialists, including Canadian military personnel.\n\n   Non-military experts point to several types of\nintelligence-gathering methods available.\n\n   Jeffrey Richelson, a senior fellow at the nonprofit National\nSecurity Archive in Washington, D.C., said, ``There are\n(intelligence-gathering) assets under the sea, on land, in the air\nand in space that can be used to monitor'' smuggler ships.\nRichelson specializes in U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies,\nand has studied the 40-year intelligence-sharing partnership\nbetween the United States and Canada.\n\n   Richelson and retired Adm. David Jeremiah, former commander of\nthe U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in separate interviews that the\nU.S.-Canadian military partnership is structured to handle ``new''\nsecurity problems such as drug trafficking or illegal migrant\nsmuggling.\n\n   ``It would not surprise me to find there is collaboration,''\nJeremiah said of the illegal immigrant situation, particularly\nsince immigration officials suspect Chinese aliens who make it\nashore in Canada are headed to find work in urban centers like New\nYork City.\n\n   While Canada has naval ships and patrol aircraft, it is the U.S.\nNavy and U.S. intelligence agencies that are able to shadow the\nsmuggler ships from the moment they leave China, Richelson said.\n\n   McKinnon acknowledged that ``you (the United States) have assets\nas far as Guam, on the other side of the Pacific. We certainly work\nwith that.''\n\n   During the Cold War, the United States developed overlapping\nsurveillance systems to track the Soviet Navy and its nuclear\nsubmarine fleet in the Pacific, and many of those systems are still\nactive.\n\n   In many cases, Richelson said, they have been modified to\nconduct surveillance on other activities, including drug smuggling,\nillegal driftnet fishing and now, the smuggling of illegal aliens.\n\n   The at-sea surveillance is far more effective than trying to\ntrack down illegal immigrants once they have entered Canada and can\ncross virtually at will into the United States. Many New York-bound\nillegals choose a notorious smuggling area near Cornwall, Ontario,\nwhere Mohawk Indian reserves straddle the U.S.-Canada boundary\nalong the St. Lawrence River.\n\n   Last December, U.S. and Canadian officials used a sting\noperation to crack an illegal human smuggling ring operating there.\nU.S. Attorney General Janet Reno called it ``the largest global\nalien smuggling ring'' operating in the two countries and estimated\nthat it had carried as many as 3,800 illegal aliens into the United\nStates over a two-year period. Many were from China's Fujian\nProvince, where most of those aboard the ships seized this summer\nwere from.\n\n   Here are some of the methods available for tracking smuggling\nships:\n\n   Satellites: Since the early 1970s, the United States has\noperated a family of powerful spy satellites that can locate and\ntrack ships by photographing them or triangulating their radio\nbroadcasts.\n\n   Underwater sensors: The multi-billion-dollar Sosus (for sound\nsurveillance) System originally designed to locate and track Soviet\nsubmarines has been altered since the decline of the Soviet/Russian\nNavy to monitor surface ships as well. Navy officials say Sosus has\nbeen effective in detecting illegal driftnet fishing vessels as\nwell as smuggling ships.\n\n   Patrol aircraft: Both the U.S. and Canadian military in the\nPacific Northwest operate land-based aircraft that can locate\nsuspicious ships and submarines. The P-3C Orion and CP-140 Aurora\naircraft usually patrol areas the surveillance networks say harbor\nsuspicious vessels.\n\n   Civilians: Tips from members of the public can be part of the\narsenal combating smuggling ships. ``We use sonar sets, ships at\nsea, everything up to Joe and Jane Canada sitting on their deck and\nspotting something suspicious on the water below their home,''\nMcKinnon said.\n\n   SUGGESTED BOX:\n\n   The surveillance of the smuggling ships intercepted off Canada\nthis summer is the latest example of the U.S. military tracking\ncivilian targets. Here are some other incidents:\n\n   In April 1988, U.S. Navy officials revealed that four Iranian\ngrain ships heading for Vancouver, B.C., through the Strait of Juan\nde Fuca had been tracked all the way from the Persian Gulf.\n\n   Concern over possible terrorism was high because U.S. Navy\naircraft had sunk two Iranian warships in the Gulf the same week as\nthe Iranian grain ships entered the strait.\n\n   Later that year, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted the vessel\nEncounter Bay with 72 tons of high-grade Laotian marijuana 600\nmiles off the Washington coast.\n\n   Officials disclosed in a federal court hearing the Encounter Bay\nhad been under U.S. surveillance since it was loaded with the drug\ncargo in Vietnam.\n\n   In 1997, officials disclosed that a special U.S. Navy\nintelligence unit based on Vancouver Island was involved in\nsurveillance of a Russian commercial shipping company operating in\nwestern Canadian ports and in Puget Sound.\n\n   The company's vessels were suspected of carrying out Russian\nmilitary intelligence missions, including snooping on Trident\nsubmarines based at Bangor Submarine Base on Hood Canal.\n\n   A U.S. Navy intelligence officer assigned to the unit suffered\neye burns from a laser while photographing a Russian freighter from\na helicopter.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. HELPING CANADA TRACK MIGRANTS \n","Text":["\n   Canada and the United States are using a network of spy\nsatellites, underwater acoustic sensors and electronic interception\ntechniques to track smuggling ships from Chinese ports, across the\nnorth Pacific Ocean and into Canadian waters where they have been\nintercepted.\n","\n   Since July 20, Canada has seized four ships carrying more than\n600 Chinese.
