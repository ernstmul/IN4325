Here are the budget lines for the second day in\nthe series. STORIES HAVE MOVED. FOUR PHOTOS AND FOUR GRAPHICS ARE\nAVAILABLE.\n\n   SMUGGLE-MAIN _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants\ninto Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming\nbusiness as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers\nequipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances\nof reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40\nHaitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last\nweekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of\nputting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector\nhas less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency\nhasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that\nperiod, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,\ndoubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.\nUnfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of\nagents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,\nCalifornia, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector\nhas 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;\nTucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2\nmillion; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60\ninches.\n\n   SMUGGLE-NIGHT _ Border Patrol Agent Larry Belotti works the\ngraveyard shift. He says he's the often the only Border Patrol\nagent working from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent\nnight, he rounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This\neffectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti\nwill spend the rest of the night processing these refugees. 30\ninches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)\n\n   SMUGGLE-PUNISH _ U.S. Attorney Tom Scott says his office is\nadopting an aggressive stand against alien smugglers. These cases\nare tough to prosecute, particularly when Cuban refugees are\ninvolved. Justice Department data shows that federal prosecutors\nhistorically haven't taken on many alien smuggling cases. A couple\nreasons. The smugglees make lousy witnesses. There's also the\nbuilt-in defense: ``I'm not a smuggler. I was fishing and rescued\nthese Cubans from their sinking raft.'' Prosecutors also have felt\nthat juries of Cuban exiles and other immigrants find it hard to\nconvict someone of helping their fellow countrymen escape\noppression. Furthermore, the courts haven't been very tough on\nconvicted smugglers, even if the case involves the deaths of\nrefugees. For example: In South Fla, the USAtty prosecuted 62\npercent of cases referred by the Border Patrol; in Arizona, 92\npercent; in Southern California, 99 percent; in South Texas, 99\npercent. In South Fla, 26 percent of smuggling cases referred to\nUSAtty ended with prison sentences; in Arizona, it's 40 percent;\nSouthern California, 57 percent; South Texas, 58 percent. 60\ninches.

(Kane, Palm Beach Post)\n\n   FOR MONDAY (Moved today):\n\n   SMUGGLE-WORKSITE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's unlawful to hire\nnon-citizens. But Florida is still the land of opportunity. An\nestimated 350,000 illegal aliens reside here. Most work in the\nvegetable and citrus farms. Many keep the tourism industry booming\nas waiters, hotel maids, etc. Some work on landscaping and\nconstruction crews. But the INS cannot go into the agricultural\nfields and doesn't have the manpower to do much other worksite\nenforcement because it has to focus attention on alien smuggling.\nFarmers hire scores of illegal workers and escape liability by\npaying licensed farm labor contractors provide crews. They also\nargue that workers today carry counterfeit documents. The INS says\nthey don't expect growers to be document experts. Migrant worker\nadvocates argue that farmers use their political clout to handcuff\nthe INS. For example: in 1990, the INS sanctioned 38 employers in\nFlorida for hiring illegals. That dropped to 16 in 1991, 6 in 1992\nand 2 in 1993. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, it was a dozen or fewer.\nOnly in 1997 did it get back up to about 20-25 employers.\n(Kane/Holland, Palm Beach Post). 60.\n\n   WASHINGTON/POLITICS\n\n   COXNET FOCUS PAGE\n\n   EDS: A CoxNet Focus page featuring the following stories is now\navailable.
