Times News Service clients)  \n By MARK SHAFFER  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX _ For years it has been a mantra among immigrants from\nLatin America to the United States.\n\n   You have gotten past all the thieves lurking in the shadows of\nthe border lands, past the Border Patrol dragnet. You are in the\nbig city, more than 100 miles from Mexico.\n\n   Home free.\n\n     But for many these days, the danger doesn't stop at the border.\n\n   Police and federal agents say that crime against immigrants has\nbeen escalating at a rapid rate recently because there's more money\nto be made _ by charging more to smuggle, and mixing drugs with the\nhuman cargo. That breeds robberies and violence and immigrants\noften are caught in the crossfire. But they remain willing to take\nthe risk, fleeing worsening economic conditions back home.\n\n   On Tuesday, three immigrant families living in a southwest\nPhoenix home were victims of a home invasion in which an infant in\nits mother's arms was shot and critically wounded after demands for\ncash, drugs and valuables were not met. The same residence also had\nbeen invaded on two other recent occasions, one in which a man was\nwounded.\n\n   That follows another home invasion in central Phoenix in late\nSeptember in which a group of five robbers laid siege to a drop\nhouse of 16 illegal immigrants, killing one man, pistol whipping\nanother and kidnapping a third.\n\n   Some have been fighting back. One woman from El Salvador called\nPhoenix police last year when a coyote, an illegal-immigrant\nsmuggler, demanded $2,000 more than the agreed-upon price to\nrelease her two daughters who were brought illegally to this\ncountry.\n\n   Cases like that are the exception.\n\n   ``There's no doubt these people are being targeted more and\nmore,'' said Phoenix police Sgt. Mike Torres. ``But we don't hear\nvery much about it because they think they will be deported.''\n\n   Tom Homan, who heads investigations for the Phoenix office of\nImmigration and Naturalization Service, also said his office hears\nabout only a small percentage of crime in which recent immigrants\nare victims or perpetrators.\n\n   ``The only time it comes to anyone's attention is if someone is\nshot and even that doesn't mean the police will be called,'' Homan\nsaid.\n\n   Homan said that drop houses are constantly being ripped off by\nrival smuggling gangs and, sometimes, even by other people who live\nin the area who anticipate big cash inside. drop houses are\nresidences where illegal immigrants are held after being smuggled\nfrom the border until family or friends pay the coyote's fee.\n\n   ``The money is big now, just about as big as dope,'' Homan said.\n``We took down one house a few weeks back at 18th Street and Van\nBuren with 114 illegals in it which had $140,000 in cash inside.\n\n   ``We used to never find weapons in drop houses. Now, you seldom\nfind one that doesn't have numerous arms in it. The smugglers are\nmore violent now and the people they smuggle are more desperate to\nstay here. You get more abuses but the silence about it is\ndeafening. For example, we have a major problem with hostage\nsituations.''\n\n   One undercover INS agent, who asked that she be referred to as\nOphelia Ruiz to protect her true identity, said she had just\nfinished working a hostage case. A coyote had placed a gun to the\nhead of a man he had smuggled into Arizona and made him call his\nwife, demanding additional money for his smuggling fee.\n\n   Because of intensified security at the border, the cost of\nsmuggling an illegal from Nogales to Phoenix has increased from\n$150 to $500 during the past three years. Ruiz also said she has\nworked other cases where rival smuggling organizations rip off drop\nhouses just as most illegals inside have paid.\n\n   ``Then they (rival smugglers) will go and advertise back in\nMexico that this and that coyote isn't any good because they can't\noffer security for the people they smuggle,'' Ruiz said. ``It's a\nvicious cycle which leads to more crime.''\n\n   Ruiz also said that most illegals are unaware when they come to\nthe Phoenix area that the coyotes also are smuggling drugs with\nthem, often hiding it on small children in groups of illegals.\n\n   ``In the old days, people smuggling and drug smuggling were two\ndifferent things,'' Ruiz said. ``Now, 98 percent of the time, the\npeople smugglers have drugs also.''\n\n   Mark Shaffer can be reached at 444-8057 or at\nmark.shaffer(at)pni.com via e-mail.  \n","Headline":"\nRECENT LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS FACE INCREASED DANGER HERE \n","Text":["\n   PHOENIX _ For years it has been a mantra among immigrants from\nLatin America to the United States.\n","\n   You have gotten past all the thieves lurking in the shadows of\nthe border lands, past the Border Patrol dragnet.
