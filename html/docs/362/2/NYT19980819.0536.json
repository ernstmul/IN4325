CHEN   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Providing the fullest account to date of an operation to smuggle\nChinese immigrants into the United States, a top organizer said\nWednesday that the smugglers transported at least 100 people on as\nmany as five voyages from South America over a year and a half,\nbefore bungling the latest trip in May off the coast of New Jersey.\n\n   The smuggler, Nam Jick Cho, 57, was so committed to the\nenterprise that he said he often flew to Venezuela and Suriname\nfrom his home in Queens to insure that the Chinese were squeezed\naboard the smuggling ship, the Oriental I. When the ship had\nmechanical trouble in Bermuda en route to New Jersey, Cho flew down\ncarrying new parts. And to prepare for the arrival of the latest\ngroup of immigrants in Belmar, N.J., he paid $7,000 for a van to\ntake the men to a parking lot in Flushing.\n\n   Cho offered these details and more Wednesday in U.S. District\nCourt in Newark, N.J., during a remarkably candid hearing in which\nhe pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges in connection with\nthe operation, which came to light when the Oops II, a smaller boat\nthat had picked up the men from the Oriental I, ran aground in New\nJersey.\n\n   Cho is the second man involved in the Oriental I operation to\nplead guilty to conspiracy charges in the last week. Three other\nmen, all crew members aboard the Oriental I, remain in government\ncustody, while a fourth _ a Queens resident named Charng Seon Choi,\nsaid to be another top organizer _ remains at large.\n\n   Before Wednesday's hearing, some details had emerged about the\nOriental I and the 23 Chinese it unloaded in New Jersey, mainly\nfrom a federal complaint, and from the Chinese themselves. But Cho\nis the first person on the operations side of the endeavor to\ndiscuss what happened and what, ultimately, went wrong in New\nJersey.\n\n   ``Among the people we have, he is an important one,'' said\nCarolyn Murray, an assistant U.S. attorney. ``He was in charge of\nland operations, so to speak. He hired some of the others.''\n\n   Speaking through a Korean interpreter, Cho said that he had been\nhired by Choi to participate in a smuggling operation that\nsolicited $25,000 to $40,000 apiece from anyone interested in\nleaving Fujian Province in southern China for North America.\n\n   In general, the scheme worked like this: First, the smugglers\ntook the immigrants to Suriname by air or by ship. A man with the\nsurname Chang, based in South America, arranged housing for the\nimmigrants. Cho secured the use of the Oriental I, a 120-foot\nfishing vessel owned by a Venezuelan company, to smuggle the\nimmigrants. Then the smugglers directed the Chinese onto a small\nboat that, in turn, reconnoitered with the Oriental I about 30\nmiles off the Suriname coast.\n\n   Each trip would include 20 or so immigrants, Cho said. And Cho\nwould receive a cut of $7,000 from the smuggling fee paid by each\nimmigrant.\n\n   In all, the Oriental I made four or five trips to North America\nbetween March 1997 and June 1998, Cho said, including two to the\nBahamas and two to the United States.\n\n   It was not clear when or where the Oriental I made its first\ntrip to the United States; Cho did not say. But Cho has also been\nindicted on similar charges in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,\nMs. Murray said. In many cases, the final destination of the\nimmigrants is Chinatown or Flushing, Queens, where jobs for Chinese\nare more plentiful.\n\n   But the most recent trip of the Oriental I was a little\ndifferent.\n\n   ``I got the impression that this trip was more unusual because\nit came into New Jersey, and not somewhere in the city,'' said Sean\nMcGovern, Cho's lawyer. ``They had presumed that it would be safer\nto go into New Jersey, with less chance of being detected by the\nauthorities.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   According to Cho, the Oriental I carried an unusually large load\nof 50 Chinese immigrants, with scheduled drop-offs in Belmar, N.J.,\nand the Bahamas. In addition, the ship broke down in Bermuda,\nrequiring Cho to fly down with new equipment.\n\n   At some point, the other smugglers gave Cho $35,000 to pay for\nthe van _ on which the imprint of the previous owner, a Korean\nchurch, was still visible _ and other expenses in New Jersey.\n\n   On May 29, he traveled to Point Pleasant, N.J., to test out a\nsmall powerboat, the Oops II, in anticipation of picking up the\nimmigrants. On May 30, Choi steered the Oops II to meet the\nOriental I, about 100 miles offshore, while Cho waited in Belmar\nwith the van.\n\n   There was dense fog, though, and after picking up the men the\nOops II ended up in the affluent town of Bay Head, eight miles off\ntarget to the south. But McGovern said that Cho told him that he\nsimply ran out of gas and drifted toward shore before dropping the\n23 off against a backdrop of mansions.\n\n   The Oriental I, meanwhile, chugged on to the Bahamas, dropping\noff 20 or so more Chinese before experiencing mechanical\ndifficulties _ again. And on June 8, the U.S. Coast Guard found the\nOriental I about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island in the\nBahamas.\n\n   Wednesday, Cho said that he felt remorse over his role in the\noperation, McGovern said. In exchange for his cooperation,\ninvestigators could pare his sentence from its of maximum of 10\nyears in jail and a $250,000 fine.\n\n   Last week, Cho Yang Nam, a deckman aboard the Oriental I,\npleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge; he, too, is cooperating\nwith authorities. Three others _ Kim Jong Che, the captain; Piao\nZhen Jia, a cook, and Jiang Yong Zhu, a mechanic _ are expected to\ngo to trial on Nov. 17, their lawyers have said.\n\n   As for the 23 Chinese from the Oops II, they remain in\ngovernment custody. The government expects to begin taking\nvideotaped depositions of some of the 23 men beginning Monday, Ms.\nMurray said, meaning that the men should be released on bond soon.\n\n   But that freedom could be brief.
