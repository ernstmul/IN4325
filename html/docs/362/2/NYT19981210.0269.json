She said the\nsmugglers collected more than $160 million over a two-year period.\n\n   Meissner said the $47,000 fee was the highest the INS has ever\nencountered for human smuggling. The operation was ``the first\nlarge-scale alien smuggling operation we have encountered on the\nnorthern border,'' Meissner said.\n\n   The investigation, Operation Over the Rainbow II, led by the\nBuffalo division of the INS, began 18 months ago with a tip to the\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police who worked together with the Toronto\ncops, the FBI, the INS, the New York State Police and the St. Regis\nMohawk Tribal Police.\n\n   The cooperation of the various agencies from the United States,\nCanada, New York, Ontario, Quebec and tribal governments proves\nthat ``we can extend the long arm of the law so there is no safe\nhaven for those who seek to profit from human misery and\ndesperation,'' Reno said.\n\n   Thomas J. Maroney, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District\nof New York who will prosecute the case, said cooperation among law\nenforcement agencies along the U.S.-Canada border is essential\nbecause the border is protected by ``a very thin line of law\nenforcement,'' unlike the U.S. border with Mexico. He declined to\nprovide details about the wiretaps but said investigators did not\nuse body wires.\n\n   The smugglers, who included people of Chinese descent as well as\nMohawk and Navajo Indians, were arrested over the past week in\nPhiladelphia, New York City and Upstate New York and charged in an\nindictment with facilitating smuggling, he said.\n\n   ``The middlemen have been very often Native Americans and some\nhave been Chinese,'' Maroney said.\n\n   If convicted, the suspects face up to 10 years in jail and\n$250,000 fines.\n\n   Most of the Chinese nationals came from the Fujian Province and\nwere flown to Taipei or Hong Kong, then to Germany, France,\nMorocco, Greenland, Cuba or Brazil. Meissner said these were merely\ntransit points and that there is no evidence that people in those\ncountries were involved in the smuggling.\n\n   The smuggling operation then brought the Chinese nationals into\nVancover, British Columbia, or Toronto using fake passports and\ndocuments. They then were turned over to Chinese smugglers known as\n``snakeheads.''\n\n   The Chinese nationals were transported to Toronto and Cornwall,\nOntario, then by boat across the St. Lawrence River to the St.\nRegis Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian\nborder near Cornwall and Massena, N.Y. From there the immigrants\nwere driven by van to Chinatown in New York City.\n","Headline":"\nINS BREAKS UP IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING RING ON CANADIAN BORDER \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ U.S. immigration officials announced Thursday that\n35 have been arrested and charged in a high-priced immigrant\nsmuggling operation that brought some 3,500 Chinese nationals into\nthe United States through a Mohawk Indian reservation on the\nU.S.-Canadian border.\n","\n   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, said the agency's new wiretap powers under\na 1996 law helped agents crack the case.\n","\n   Each of the immigrants paid $47,000 to the smugglers to sneak\nthem into the United States from China, traveling over air, water\nand land, according to Attorney General Janet Reno.
