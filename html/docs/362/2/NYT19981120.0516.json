The operations offered ``an example of the increasingly\ninternational scope'' of illegal-alien trafficking, she said.\n\n   The primary smuggling itinerary involved flights from India to\nRussia and then on to Cuba. Smugglers moved their human cargo from\nCuba by boat to the Bahamas, where the illegal aliens boarded\nplanes or boats to Miami.\n\n   Miami served as a transit point, from which smugglers\ntransported aliens to businesses located primarily along the\nEastern Seaboard. Very few of the Indians settled in Florida,\ninvestigators said. Authorities declined to name the businesses.\n\n   ``We believe that at least 12,000 people were smuggled into the\nUnited States during the past three years,'' said Doris Meissner,\ncommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n   People paid as much as $25,000 each to be smuggled into the\ncountry, officials said. The fees often were paid by the aliens'\nfamilies or employers. Sometimes, arriving aliens were locked in\n``stash houses'' until fees were paid. Investigators located one\nsuch house in Miami and others in New Jersey.\n\n   The kingpins of two cartels have been arrested. Nitin Shettie,\n30, an Indian who went by the name Nick Diaz, was apprehended\nduring a Nov. 14 raid at his home in Nassau, Bahamas. Authorities\nfound 31 aliens inside the house.\n\n   ``He was very surprised when he said us,'' said Border Patrol\nSpecial Agent Steven Quinones, who participated in the raid.\n\n   Another cartel leader, Navtej Pall Singh Sandu, 40, of London,\nwas arrested Wednesday in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The leader of the\nthird cartel, Niranjan Maan Singh, 58, is still being sought and\nbelieved to be in India.\n\n   The investigation dubbed Operation Seek and Keep marked the\nfirst time agents used the wire-tapping authority granted to them\nunder the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility\nAct of 1996. During the investigation, agents intercepted more than\n35,000 telephone calls.\n\n   The case will also mark the first time that money-laundering\ncharges will be used in the prosecution of alien smugglers.\nProsecutors explained that money-laundering convictions will yield\nprison sentences than alien smuggling.\n\n   Investigators said the smugglers, which sometimes competed with\neach other, had been in business for at least a decade.\n\n   Though there is no evidence that smuggled aliens suffered abuse\nat the hands of the cartels, their journeys were ``hard, gruelling\ntrips, fraught with danger,'' Coggins said.\n\n   ``Some of these illegal aliens were in transit for months and\nmonths,'' he said.\n\n   Though most of the businesses hiring the aliens are located on\nthe East Coast, employers were found in 38 states, investigators\nsaid. Typically, the Indians were employed in minimum-wage jobs, an\nagent said.\n\n   Reno described the businesses as ``unscrupulous employers... who\nwanted cheap labor and fearful workers who could easily be\nmanipulated.''\n\n   Coggins said his office is following about 1,000 leads on\nbusinesses that placed orders with the smuggling operations for\nillegal workers. To date, law enformcement officers have visited 26\nwork sites, he said.\n\n   Smuggling fees were shipped to India through Dallas, the\nBahamas, Canada, Dubai, Ecuador or the United Arab Emirates, INS\nofficials said.\n\n   The governments of the Bahamas, Canada, the Dominican Republic,\nEcuador, India and Panama cooperated in the investigation, which\nalso involved the FBI, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue\nService, State Department and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\n   The governments of Russia and Cuba were not involved in the\ninvestigation.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI _ Calling it the most sophisticated immigrant-smuggling\noperation in the nation's history, immigration officials announced\nFriday the dismantling of three foreign cartels that funneled\nthousands of Indian nationals into the United States through South\nFlorida.\n","\n   The smugglers provided the undocumented aliens to employers who\n``placed orders'' for the cheap laborers, investigators said.\nImmigration officials said they intend to seek sanctions against\nbusinesses that employed the aliens.\n","\n   Collectively, the cartels reaped nearly $220 million in\nsmuggling fees during the past three years, immigration officials\nestimated.\n","\n   ``It's time for those who trafficked in flesh to pay their pound\nof flesh,'' vowed U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins, whose Dallas office\nlodged three indictments against the cartels' top operators.\n","\n   Twenty-one of the 31 people named in the indictment have been\narrested.\n","\n   Attorney General Janet Reno said the governments of a half-dozen\ncountries cooperated with U.S. investigators to smash the smuggling\nrings.
