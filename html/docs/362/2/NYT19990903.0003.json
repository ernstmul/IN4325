COAST STIRS ANGER, AND WORRY \n\n   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  \n By JOEL CONNELLY  \n c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  \n\n   VICTORIA, B.C. _ They spent $38,000 each for the privilege of\nspending 10 weeks at sea in a rusting, rickety ship, being fed a\nbowl of rice and two glasses of water a day, heading for what they\nwere told was the promised land.\n\n   In the past seven weeks, three ships crowded with 450 Chinese\nhave been seized off the coast of British Columbia, the passengers\nhauled off to a detention center near Victoria. The latest and\nlargest shipload _ 190 people _ was captured Tuesday.\n\n   ``They come because they are told Canada is the golden mountain,\neverybody is rich and within two years everybody pays it off,''\nsaid Kevin Doyle, a Victoria lawyer who waited Thursday as Canadian\nimmigration officials began interviewing the latest group.\n\n   Authorities are still piecing together the story of the latest\nillegal arrivals. But some information has been gleaned from\nstories told by the 123 Chinese on a boat discovered off Vancouver\nIsland on July 20, and a second boatload of 131 people sent ashore\nat the southern tip of the Queen Charlotte Islands on Aug. 11,\ntranslators and attorneys said.\n\n   The Chinese or their families paid or pledged the huge sum for\nthe voyage from China's Fujian Province, directly across the strait\nfrom Taiwan. It is a province that has benefited from a burgeoning\nmarket economy, but also has seen growing poverty, especially among\nfarmers.\n\n   Their destination was a North American country with among the\nmost liberal immigration laws in the world.\n\n   Many of the Chinese may also be headed to New York, and an\nillegal economy in which they hope to work off the amount paid or\npledged to their passage.\n\n   Few of them have produced any identity papers. Nor has any\nwritten agreement been made with smugglers.\n\n   On one of the ships, those who had paid $10,000 of their passage\nwere allowed up on deck. The others were kept below, 50 to a room,\nwith a bucket for a toilet.\n\n   While it is a costly and dangerous trip from Fujian Province to\nCanada, many illegals take the risk. They can claim refugee status,\nwhich in most cases allows a person to remain in Canada for 11\nmonths. Adults are usually released into Canadian society.\n\n   Many simply vanish; an estimated 70 percent of refugee claimants\nfrom Fujian Province from previous seizures have failed to report.\n\n   George Varnai, regional manager for Immigration Canada, told\nVoice of America earlier this week that many refugee claimants who\ndisappear are bound for the United States.\n\n   ``There is certainly some common wisdom out there, that's all it\nis, common wisdom, that many of them, certainly from the Fujian\nChinese population who disappear, may in fact be smuggled or going\nto the United States without status,'' Varnai said.\n\n   The appearance of more than 440 illegal immigrants has caused a\npolitical uproar _ and a possible upheaval of public opinion _ in\nCanada.\n\n   The apprehension of three boats in a little more than a month\nhas raised questions about the security of the coastline. The\nBritish Columbia government is being forced to care for 75\nchildren, as young as 6 years old, from the first two boats. The\ncost comes to more than $550,000 a month. Another 29 juveniles were\non the boat apprehended this week.\n\n   But the real public anger was stirred when 86 passengers from\nthe first boat were released _ everybody on board claimed refugee\nstatus _ and five of the illegals promptly disappeared.\n\n   ``All you have to do in Canada is say, `I am a refugee.' They\nprocess you, they turn you loose and away you go,'' said John\nReynolds, a member of Parliament from the opposition Reform Party.\n\n   ``You don't want these people down there'' in the United States,\nReynolds said. ``We certainly don't want them. In 25 years I've\nnever seen an issue that made people so mad.''\n\n   Reynolds argued that Canada should use its trade with China ``as\na hammer'' to get the Chinese government to stop ships filled with\nillegals from leaving Fujian Province, and to make China take back\nthe human cargo.\n\n   At a coffee shop not far from the Canadian Armed Forces base at\nEsquimalt, where the latest arrivals are being processed, opinion\nseemed unanimous: Send them home.\n\n   ``We must show that we won't tolerate this. Otherwise, how many\nboats will we see off our coast?'' asked Shirley Clarke, a\nsaleswoman and self-described progressive.\n\n   The Canadian government has defended the immigrants' right to\napply for refugee status. Anybody who arrives in Canada ``by boat,\nplane, train, car or on foot'' has the right to make a refugee\nclaim and have that claim heard, Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan\nsaid Tuesday.\n\n   But Immigration Canada has tightened procedures. It has so far\nrefused to release any of the 74 people from the second ship who\nhave claimed refugee status. People can be held if it is determined\nthey are unlikely to appear before refugee adjudicators.\n\n   An additional 58 of those aboard the second ship have been found\nsubject to ``exclusion orders'' either because of suspected illegal\nactivity or possible involvement in the smuggling ring.\n\n   The rejected immigrants will be sent out of Canada to China,\nImmigration Canada spokesperson Janis Harper said Thursday.\n\n   The Chinese government has taken a somewhat contradictory\nposition. It has said that Canada should not grant refugee status\nto the illegal passengers. But its embassy in Ottawa has yet to\nindicate that China will take back any of the boat people from\nFujian.\n\n   The new world of Canada doubtless looked attractive as the\nlatest 190 passengers began processing Thursday. The Olympic\nMountains loomed across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Chinese\npassed the time by tossing Frisbees and playing volleyball with\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police officers assigned to guard them.\n\n   They face a potentially difficult reception from security\nofficers at home. Earlier this week, an immigration board turned\ndown the refugee application of a 16-year-old boy from the first\nboat. The teenager claimed to have been a Christian who had been in\nhiding after public security agents saw him distributing leaflets\nfor an unregistered Protestant meeting in his village.\n\n   The board did not believe the young man, who ``blanked out''\nunder the board's questioning, said his lawyer, Don Bohun. When\nasked to name the central figure in Christianity, he identified the\nvillager in charge of the prayer meeting.\n\n   Bohun fears what will happen if his client is returned home. A\nrecent phone contact brought news that the teenager's mother is in\nhiding, and that security officials have broken down the door of\nhis house.\n\n   ``He thinks he would get a prison sentence of four years,''\nBohun said. ``He said that what he is really afraid of is that he\nwill be beaten when he gets back to his village for the trouble he\nhas caused.''\n\n   One young man aboard the second boat did leave China once\nbefore, was caught in the United States and sent back home. ``He\nwas arrested, he was repeatedly beaten with an electric baton, and\nhe was released only when his relatives came up with money to pay\nthe officials,'' said Doyle, who is representing the man.\n\n   Trying to stem anger in Canada, Immigration Minister Caplan said\nWednesday that the arrival of fall storms will help solve the\nproblem by preventing illegal voyages.\n","Headline":"\nFLOOD OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS OFF B.C.
