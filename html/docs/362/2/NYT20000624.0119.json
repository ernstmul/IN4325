LAKSHMANAN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   XIANZHI, China _ The smugglers promised a journey to prosperous\nnew lives in the West, in silk-lined cabins supplied with oxygen.\nFor the last leg, the illegal immigrants would ride a fast\ncatamaran to England. It would be like a vacation promoted in\nglossy brochures for rich, urban Chinese.\n\n   Instead, the 60 men and women from rural China, who relatives\nsay were charged between $20,000 and $30,000 each for their illicit\npassage, were found entombed in the back of an airtight,\nunrefrigerated truck last week by customs inspectors in Dover,\nEngland.\n\n   Packed behind a wall of tomato crates, all but two of them\nsuffocated. Many of them had flown from Beijing to Eastern Europe,\ntraveled over land to the Netherlands and Belgium, and then were\ncrammed into the truck for the ferry trip to England.\n\n   ``On June 6, he called his wife to say he was going to England,\nbut since then, we've had no news,'' said Mrs. Lin, a middle-aged\nfarmer in the Fujian Province village of Xianzhi, who believes her\nson was one of the victims.\n\n   Her arms hugging her knees, Mrs. Lin choked on tears as she\nexplained why her son took such a risk.\n\n   ``The house is breaking down,'' she said, motioning around her\ndark, musty dwelling, with its concrete floor and molding walls.\n``He was just a bricklayer, and he couldn't make enough money here\nto renovate our house.''\n\n   On the single dirt road that runs through this village, scrawny\nchickens ran wild. Inside, dozens of modestly dressed residents\npacked into the room to listen. ``Everyone in this village has to\ngo out, because we don't have enough money. The average income is\n1,000 yuan ($120) a month,'' explained the missing man's aunt, her\narm wrapped around her grieving sister.\n\n   The interview was cut short when authorities burst in and\nordered this journalist into an official vehicle headed for the\nChangle City Propaganda Department. At least 10 other foreign\nreporters, picked up in nearby villages, were also questioned and\ntold to leave the area. At least one British reporter, tracked by\npolice after he tried to contact alleged smugglers, was escorted\nonto a flight back to Beijing.\n\n   In a reflection of China's sensitivity to illegal emigration,\nauthorities went to every village that was home to a suspected\nvictim. They ordered local residents not to speak to ``suspicious\nforeigners.'' Police were posted outside one man's home after he\ntold a reporter his son was missing. Another family changed its\nstory. Families can be punished for helping relatives flee.\n\n   Despite the terrible risks, an estimated 100,000 Chinese pay to\nbe smuggled overseas to Western countries every year, according to\nthe US Immigration and Naturalization Service. Ten percent are\nbelieved to find their way to the United States. Last year, the INS\ncaught 2,585 smuggled Chinese, more than double the number detained\nin 1998, and four times the number in 1997. Some are deported,\nwhile others apply for asylum. Most go undetected, and unknown\nnumbers perish en route.\n\n   In January alone, more than 100 undocumented Chinese were found\ncrammed into containers at ports in Seattle and Vancouver, Canada,\nincluding three who died on the way to Seattle.\n\n   Cashing in on people's dreams of a better life has become big\nbusiness; smugglers net $3 billion annually from Chinese passengers\nalone, said Jean-Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization\nfor Migration.\n\n   All of the victims in the Dover case are believed to be from\nFujian Province, in southeastern China. Numerous Fujian villages\nhave seen 10 percent of their residents depart each year. One has\nbeen dubbed the ``widows' village,'' because almost every man of\nworking age has gone overseas to work. In another, locals say\nfour-fifths of their young people have left.\n\n   The determination to emigrate seems paradoxical, since Fujian is\none of China's richest provinces. But its long coastline has eased\ngetaways, fueling a diaspora that dates back two centuries. Fujian\nmigrants built US railroads and mined gold in the 1800s,\nestablished corporate empires in Southeast Asia, and started\nbusinesses in Chinatowns around the world.\n\n   In the last decade, economic reforms and China's opening to the\nWest have encouraged new forms of corruption and organized crime,\nwhich prey on aspiring and gullible villagers who dream of getting\nrich overseas _ especially in the United States, which is known\nhere as ``the golden mountain.''\n\n   In almost every village for 100 miles here, small paddy fields\nand decaying brick shacks are juxtaposed against ostentatious,\nsingle-family homes, built with money sent back home. Decorated\nwith white tile, tinted windows, and flourishes such as rooftop\npavilions, these monuments to success abroad are often empty or\noccupied only by elderly parents.\n\n   ``Of course it's because of the money'' that people leave, said\nMr. Lin, a 48-year-old farmer in Zhai Qian, a fishing village\neclipsed by a busy port in nearby Fuqing.\n\n   ``Yes, Fujian is richer than other provinces, but we still don't\nhave enough money to build a house. Not even by the end of my life\ncould I afford a house like that,'' he said, pointing at a pink and\nwhite, four-story tower crowned with a pink pagoda.\n\n   With each new house that sprouts up, complete with flush toilets\nand double-glazed windows, villagers who cannot afford such\nluxuries say they feel like failures and cowards for not trying to\nmake their fortune overseas.\n\n   Those who have gone are usually too ashamed to describe the\nhorrific conditions they endured during the journey. It may include\nbeatings and rape. Few ever admit to being forced into indentured\nservitude at restaurants or sweatshops to pay off the $20,000 to\n$50,000 cost of getting to Europe or the United States. Ten percent\nof the price goes to local ``fixers,'' known as snakeheads, who\narrange the journey, according to a businessman familiar with the\nprocess; the rest goes to Chinese criminal gangs overseas.\n\n   Some of the immigrants have landed in Boston's Chinatown, where\npolice in the mid-1990s discovered migrants kept as virtual slaves\nuntil their smuggling debt was paid. Some women are forced into\nprostitution, but tell relatives they are secretaries. No questions\nare asked, because the money keeps flowing home.\n\n   ``A guy in the next village went overseas and within a few\nyears, brought back 1 million yuan ($120,048) and built a six-story\nhouse and used the rest to start a business. My husband made less\nthan $100 a month,'' said He Xiaohong of Changqi village, who\nbelieves her 24-year-old husband is among those found in Dover.\n``The snakehead told us the journey was safe, that he'd fly from\nShanghai to Beijing, and from Beijing direct to England.''\n\n   The snakehead told them European customs was lax during the\nmonth of June, so he should go now. Her husband was given a\nYugoslav passport, and took a train to Beijing and a flight to\nBelgrade, according to Apple Daily, a Hong Kong newspaper. From\nthere, he went through Austria, Hungary, and countries she had\nnever heard of. When he called last month from Holland, his\npassport, ID, and money had been seized by snakeheads. She has not\nheard from him since.\n\n   Clutching their baby and crying, He said that if her husband\ncomes back safely, ``I won't let him try again. After this tragedy,\nI won't dream of money anymore.''\n\n   Another family in Changqi told Apple Daily that they last heard\nfrom their son on June 14, when he called from Holland, en route to\nEngland. Wailing hysterically, Chen Yuming, 57, said she and her\nhusband were against their son's illegal escape. ``We never\nexpected he'd be trapped in an iron box,'' she said.\n\n   The next day, authorities came, and Chen and her husband, Cao\nYigan, 63, changed their story, telling this reporter that no one\nfrom their village ever had left.\n\n   In the past, local authorities have tended to turn a blind eye\nto human smuggling. Remittances from abroad have fed a building\nboom and enriched the province, and the exodus has controlled\npopulation growth.\n\n   But the outflow has shamed Beijing. Each sensational smuggling\ntragedy makes life in China seem so terrible that people are\nwilling to die to get out.\n\n   Although most Fujian peasants have enough to eat and China's\npolicy limiting families to one child is loosely enforced in\nvillages, those who make it to the West are often coached by\nsmugglers to claim persecution for their political views or for not\nadhering to the one-child policy.\n\n   Last year, the Federal Board of Immigration Appeals in the\nUnited States reviewed 6,067 asylum applications from Chinese, of\nwhich 929 were granted.\n\n   Political persecution is widespread in China, but those targeted\nare most often religious dissidents, democracy activists and labor\norganizers who pose a threat to the Communist Party's grip on power\n_ not farmers.\n\n   Beijing has started to crack down on smuggling, last year\ncapturing 9,000 stowaways and 800 snakeheads, who were fined or\nimprisoned. But many suspect that some corrupt customs agents help\nthe smugglers.\n\n   The government is trying to educate people about the risks, with\ngraphic pictures of bodies of stowaways that washed ashore. In the\ntown of Qian Zhai, huge slogans painted on the walls scream the\nwarning: ``It's dangerous, illegal and hazardous to your health to\nleave your country illegally!'' Another urges, ``Expose the\nsnakeheads and middlemen!''\n\n   But people here pay little attention. ``Of course some people\nknow how dangerous it is, but everyone who has gone makes so much\nmoney,'' said Xiao Yongwen, 25, a driver from Fuzhou. ``People just\nbuild new houses and show off their money, and never mention how\nhard it all was.''\n","Headline":"\nDREAMS OF NEW LIVES LED IMMIGRANTS ON FATAL JOURNEY \n","Text":["\n   XIANZHI, China _ The smugglers promised a journey to prosperous\nnew lives in the West, in silk-lined cabins supplied with oxygen.\nFor the last leg, the illegal immigrants would ride a fast\ncatamaran to England.
