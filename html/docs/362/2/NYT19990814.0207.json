Was an employer waiting for them?\n\n   INS District Director Thomas Fischer said the agents collected\nnames, dates of birth and other information from the men. The\nagency flew Chinese-speaking agents to Atlanta from New York to\nhelp, but Fischer said it was slow going.\n\n   ``Historically the Asians have been very secretive,'' he said.\n``They tend not to be as verbose as some other nationalities\nregarding their family and anyone who assisted them.''\n\n   INS agents found the 132 men and boys Thursday in a secret\ncompartment on the Prince Nicolas, a ship registered in Cyprus.\nFischer said the ship had sailed from China around the southern tip\nof Africa and docked in Stockholm, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark,\nbefore crossing the Atlantic for Savannah.\n\n   He said a ship's officer stayed in Stockholm and told Swedish\nauthorities about the hidden Chinese.

James Hanzalik of the U.S. Coast Guard, which searched\nthe ship unsuccessfully before the INS became involved, said crew\nmembers ``were pretty evasive'' when questioned. He said the\nillegal immigrants were ``pretty frightened.''\n\n   Fischer said he thinks some crew members _ 26 Chinese, a\nLithuanian and a Filipino _ helped smuggle the Chinese. He said\nsmuggling ships often have an ``enforcer'' aboard to keep\npassengers in line.\n\n   The INS said Chinese usually pay $30,000 to $50,000 for a trip\nto the United States, often living in squalid conditions on voyages\nthat can take weeks. Organized crime groups in China have been\nlinked to immigrant smuggling.\n\n   ``These people weren't just traveling solo,'' Fischer said.\n\n   He said the INS plans to keep the passengers and crew in custody\nuntil it deports them. Officials will consider any requests for\npolitical asylum, but an INS spokesman said the agency typically\nconsiders Chinese who are being smuggled into this country as\n``economic migrants'' ineligible for asylum.\n\n   Meanwhile, at least five lawyers have volunteered to help the\nChinese navigate the legal maze.\n\n   Bob Marshall, a retired lawyer who volunteers at an immigration\nclinic sponsored by Catholic Social Services in Atlanta, said he\nplans to work with some of the 51 boys ages 14-17 who were among\nthe detainees on the Prince Nicolas. He said he would explain\nimmigration law, appear in immigration court on their behalf and\nanswer their questions about the legal process.\n\n   He said he also has helped some Chinese youngsters detained\nafter authorities busted a smuggling ring near Guam recently. He\nsaid those teenagers have been in custody in Georgia for at least\nfour months. Based on their experience, he said, the 132 Chinese\nfound in Savannah probably will be in custody for several months\nuntil an immigration judge decides their fate.\n\n   ``It can take a long time.
