Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 3:\n\n   The deaths of 58 Chinese immigrants found suffocated in an\nairless container truck at the port of Dover, England, last month,\nprovided stark witness to the rising global traffic in people who\nillegally cross borders and whole continents in search of a better\nlife.

They represented only a tiny part of\nthe flow of millions making dangerous journeys to distant lands.\n\n   In 1993, 10 Chinese immigrants died trying to swim to shore when\nthe Golden Venture, a ship carrying nearly 300 immigrants from\nsouthern China, ran aground off Queens. In 1995, 18 Sri Lankans\nwere found dead in a container truck in Hungary. In 1998, seven\nMexicans died in the California desert, abandoned by smugglers.\nReports of these catastrophes, however, have not discouraged other\npeople from migrating.\n\n   The trade in illegal migration is growing partly because more\ncountries have tightened legal avenues for immigration, as has\nhappened in Europe. The fall of the Berlin Wall is often cited as a\nfactor because it opened Central and Eastern Europe as migration\nroutes. But there are few reliable statistics in this field, and\neven categorizing criminal activities can be difficult since the\nillegal transport of people can vary from individuals paying\nsmugglers to help them cross borders to individuals who are\nkidnapped or trapped into slavery by traffickers for the sex\nindustry. The common characteristic is that all of the trade\noperates underground, with victims who are in no position to report\nabuse. Evidence that the industry exists tends to surface only when\nsmuggled migrants are found dead, or when those in bondage manage\nto escape.\n\n   Conservative estimates suggest that some 700,000 women and\nchildren are illegally transported for sexual and labor\nexploitation each year, with at least 50,000 brought into the\nUnited States. The total number of migrants smuggled across borders\nis more than 4 million a year worldwide.\n\n   The International Organization for Migration estimates that\nroughly 400,000 people are smuggled into Western Europe alone each\nyear. Smuggling into the United States has also increased. The\nImmigration and Naturalization Service has found that illegal\nborder crossers are relying more heavily on smugglers, and that the\nnumber of smuggled people apprehended has risen from 138,000 in\n1997 to 247,000 in 1999.\n\n   Fighting this trade is extremely difficult, in part because\ngovernments know so little about these cross-border enterprises.\nEven with the arrest of the Dutch truck driver and several others\nin connection with the Dover case, there is scant information about\nthat operation. Still, it is clear the smugglers had to be part of\na sophisticated, highly flexible network that could manage the trip\nacross two continents. Their profits are high. Chinese migrants are\nthought to pay at least $25,000 to be smuggled to Europe. The\nglobal trade is believed to be worth more than $7 billion a year.\n\n   Not much can be done in the short term to deal with the main\nfactors, poverty and persecution, that lie at the root of these sad\nmigrations.
