The boats have carried a total of more than 600 Chinese who\nhave pledged or paid smugglers an average of about $38,000 for the\ntrans-Pacific crossing, often in filthy, crowded conditions.\n\n   ``This is the largest operation we have ever seen off the West\nCoast. We believe organized crime is responsible,'' said Constable\nTracey Rook of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n   A fifth boat, spotted sinking off the Queen Charlotte Islands in\nearly July, is believed to have earlier discharged its human cargo\non shore.

Nationwide warrants have been issued for\ntheir arrests after they did not appear for scheduled meetings with\nimmigration officials.\n\n   Law enforcement officials speculated privately that some or most\nmay have gone to New York, where they work off the cost of passage.\n\n   Canada has since clamped down on subsequent releases. It was\nholding 378 illegal migrants before the latest boat was seized off\nNootka Sound, about 170 miles northwest of Victoria.\n\n   ``This ship is considerably larger than previous ships. It is a\nsmall coastal freighter rather than a decrepit fishing boat,'' said\nLt. Cmdr. Chris Henderson of Canada's Department of National\nDefense. He said the migrants aboard the ship appeared to be in\ngood health.\n\n   The 250-foot-long ship was sighted about 500 miles off Vancouver\nIsland on Tuesday by a long-range military patrol aircraft. ``As\nluck would have it,'' Henderson said, the naval destroyer Huron had\nbeen dispatched to aid the RCMP and Immigration Canada in\napprehending the vessel.\n\n   Canadian officials declined to say whether the United States\nassisted in detecting smugglers' ships headed for the coast.\n\n   ``I am not at all prepared to discuss sharing of information\nbetween the Canadian Armed Forces and the American military,''\nHenderson said.\n\n   Immigration Canada said it knows of no other smuggler boats\npresently headed for the West Coast. But the human cargoes have\nbeen arriving at a rate of one every 12 days. Based on interviews\nwith the Chinese passengers, many of them reluctant to talk,\nofficials have privately speculated that as many as 11 boats are\nheaded eastbound across the Pacific Ocean.\n\n   Canada hopes the arrival of fall storms from the Gulf of Alaska\nwill deter further human smuggling.\n\n   ``It is our understanding there is a finite window for this kind\nof activity,'' said George Varnai, Vancouver manager for\nImmigration Canada.\n\n   The latest boat was ordered to halt late Thursday afternoon at a\npoint 18 miles off Vancouver Island. The smugglers' boat instead\nincreased its speed toward shore. But with the Huron bearing down\non it, and three helicopters hovering overhead, the boat stopped\nand a white T-shirt was hoisted.\n\n   The vessel was then escorted to historic Nootka Sound, where\n18th-century British explorer Capt. James Cook first landed and\ntraded with natives for furs in what is now Canada.\n\n   ``It appears that _ thankfully _ we might have taken them by\nsurprise,'' Henderson said. ``It is critical that we deny certain\ninformation to the persons planning these operations, so they do\nnot make changes in their plans.''\n\n   The illegal immigrants, and those holding them, have been caught\nin a vise.\n\n   The Chinese are mainly poor farmers or street merchants with\nlittle education. They live in fear of the smugglers _ known as\n``snakeheads'' _ and have been reluctant to provide information,\nRook said Friday.\n\n   Johnston said reports from the Chinese community in Vancouver\nindicate that smugglers and their agents have threatened those from\nthe first boatload of migrants who were released.\n\n   Many of the illegal migrants have applied for refugee status in\nCanada.
