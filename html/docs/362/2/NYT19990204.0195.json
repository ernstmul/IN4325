Happy to be on U.S. soil,\nthat is.\n\n   Smiling, the Cuban migrant tells a familiar story that, at\nfirst, sounds like so many others, of paying someone he knows only\nby reputation to help him escape his communist homeland.\n\n   But his tale strikes a unique chord when he reveals his mode of\ntransportation -- plane, not boat.\n\n   ``The economic situation is so bad in Cuba that I would have\ndone anything to get out,'' explained Acosta, 35, who left behind a\n14-year-old son. ``Traveling by airplane is safer and it's more of\na sure thing than traveling by boat.''\n\n   To get the money to pay for the trip, he sold everything he had\n-- his bed, stereo, all of his clothes.\n\n   As a worker in a tobacco factory, he had access to cigars, which\nhe sold to tourists for U.S. dollars.\n\n   Eventually, he scraped together $2,500, which he gave to a\nsmuggler promising safe passage to Florida.\n\n   The journey, which began Jan. 20, was a two-legged one -- a hop\nto Costa Rica, then on to Miami.\n\n   Smuggling via plane is one often-overlooked twist in the recent\nsaga of rising illegal migration from both Cuba and Haiti to South\nFlorida.\n\n   At the same time, smuggling has become a growing concern in\nFlorida, which has seen a huge increase in the number of refugee\nmigrants arriving by both plane and boat.\n\n   ``There has been a marked increase in the flow of migrants to\nthe southeastern part of the United States, and the larger\npercentage is being smuggled in,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Marcus Woodring,\npublic affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard here.\n\n   Immigration officials estimate that 80 percent of all illegal\nmigrants, refugees in South Florida are smuggled.\n\n   They say smuggling has been on the rise since the United States\nand Cuba signed an immigration agreement in 1995 that allowed\nCubans picked up at sea to be immediately returned to their\ncountry.\n\n   This change in U.S. policy forced Cubans to forgo their\nhome-made rafts and turn to smugglers with high-powered speedboats\nfast enough to outrun Coast Guard cutters.\n\n   In recent months, tales of dramatic landings on Florida's\nbeaches have grabbed the headlines.\n\n   But a growing number of refugees also are turning to smugglers\nto arrange trips by plane, which they say gives them an even better\nchance of reaching South Florida.\n\n   Smuggling via plane works like this: The smugglers receive a\nfee, which can range from $2,000 to $8,000, to provide permits so\nthat the Cubans can fly to Costa Rica or another third country.\nThere, the Cubans are provided with a place to stay as well as with\nfalse passports so that they can get on a plane to Miami. While in\nthe plane or at the Miami International Airport, the Cubans often\ndestroy their false documents. Once safely on U.S. soil, they're\nfree to request political asylum.\n\n   Haitians also use smugglers, but they generally don't destroy\ntheir documents. Instead, they're more likely to pass them off as\ngenuine.\n\n   ``The Miami airport sees a significant number of people every\nday coming through with no documents or bogus documents,'' said Dan\nGeoghegan(CQ), assistant chief in the U.S. Border Patrol office\nhere. ``The Cubans get on an airplane in Venezuela or Costa Rica or\nwherever and they flush their documents down the toilet.''\n\n   Even Cuban President Fidel Castro has acknowledged immigrant\nsmuggling as a pressing concern.\n\n   In a recent speech, he said his government has asked for life\nsentences for ``inhuman'' smugglers.\n\n   At the same time, he urged the Clinton administration to send\nback Cubans who reach South Florida.\n\n   Cuba reportedly has captured and imprisoned 15 smugglers from\nthe United States over the past year who are currently awaiting\nsentencing.\n\n   ``Since they are residents of the United States, we are willing\nto return them to be punished there,'' Castro said.\n\n   Meanwhile, the U.S. Catholic Conference, an agency here\nresponsible for helping resettle Cuban and Haitian refugees, has\nexperienced a big surge in clients. It expects to see 3,500\nrefugees this year, compared with 2,000 last year.\n\n   ``These people have no money, they're desperate, they feel like\nthey're going to die unless they leave their countries,'' said Raul\nHernandez, coordinator of Cuban-Haitian programs.\n\n   Just last Monday, 11 frightened Cubans washed up on trendy South\nBeach just as Emilio Estefan, the Cuban-born musician and husband\nof singer Gloria Estefan, was taking his morning jog.\n\n   ``It was so cold I brought them a little Cuban coffee just to\nwelcome them to the land of freedom,'' he said.\n\n   The men, who were taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol,\nsaid they left Cuba within the last week aboard a 15-foot wooden\nvessel powered by a diesel engine.\n\n   In the year ending September 1998, U.S. Border Patrol agents\npicked up about 1,200 refugees in South Florida.\n\n   They are now on track to more than double that amount this year,\ndetaining more than 900 since October.\n\n   The Coast Guard, which handles those caught at sea, intercepted\n1,047 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians in 1998, compared with 406 Cubans\nand 587 Haitians in 1997.\n\n   This year, immigration officials believe several factors will\nkeep migrants coming in growing numbers.\n\n   The lingering effects of Hurricane Georges continue to drive at\nleast part of the exodus.\n\n   Also, the economy in Cuba has remained stagnant, while an\nongoing political crisis has paralyzed Haiti, where 80 percent of\nthe population is unemployed or underemployed.\n\n   ``Haitians are coming in by boat, and they are also coming in\nthrough the airport,'' said Mark Briesemeister(CQ), a supervising\nspecial agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's\nanti-smuggling unit. ``They aren't usually smuggled directly from\nHaiti, but they come via the Bahamas.''\n\n   He said his unit is currently prosecuting 17 smuggling cases.\n\n   In a poll of 1,400 Haitians conducted last year by the U.S.\nEmbassy in Haiti, nearly three-fourths of those surveyed said they\nwould leave their poor homeland if they could.\n\n   ``With total chaos in Haiti, these desperate people don't have\nany choice but to try and leave,'' said Ken Boodhoo, an expert on\nHaiti at Florida International University.\n\n   Some experts say U.S. policy is also to blame for the increased\nmigration flow.\n\n   In March 1998, President Clinton allowed Cuban-Americans to send\nup to $1,200 a year to family members in Cuba. He changed the\nmeasure last month to allow any American to send money to anyone in\nCuba.\n\n   Remittances to residents of Cuba now total more than $800\nmillion a year, a staggering amount that helps keep Cuba's\nfoundering economy afloat, and in some cases also allows Cubans to\nfund their escape.\n\n   ``I'd say U.S. policy affects immigration because these\nremittances allow Cubans to pay smugglers to bring them here in\nhigh-speed boats, or however they can,'' said Mark Krikorian of the\nCenter for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank\nthat favors reduced rates of immigration.\n\n   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)\n\n   Although immigration numbers are up this year, they're nowhere\nnear those of the last benchmark year for illegal immigration. In\n1994, more than 30,000 Cubans sailed to Florida aboard rafts, inner\ntubes, and anything else that floated after Castro stopped his\ncrackdown on citizens trying to flee.\n\n   The crisis forced President Clinton to revise U.S.-Cuban policy\nso that Cubans captured at sea would be immediately returned to\nCuba.\n\n   U.S. policy toward captured Haitians -- about 25,000 of whom\narrived in 1994 -- has been to return them to Haiti whether they're\npicked up at sea or on land.\n\n   If Cubans make it to U.S. soil, they're generally detained only\na matter of days before being released into society.\n\n   That's why a plane or a speedboat have become necessities for\nCubans unwilling to risk being returned to Cuba.\n\n   Reinaldo Mesa, a Cuban psychiatrist, arrived in Miami via plane\non Jan. 17.\n\n   He has four brothers and sisters in Cuba, who pooled their money\nto pay a smuggler so that Mesa could make the trip to Florida,\nstopping in Costa Rica first.\n\n   ``I am the only one in my family with a college education, so\nthey sent me here to earn money to send back,'' said Mesa, 48. ``I\nearned only US$17 a month working as a doctor in Cuba, so I can be\nof more help to my family if I'm here.''\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI _ Flat broke, with no family or friends to turn to, Mario\nAcosta says he's a gloriously happy man.
