Times News Service   \n\n   ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y. _ It was the kind of\nsmuggling operation that, at its most efficient, resembled a\nwell-coached relay team seamlessly passing a valuable baton.\n\n   In China, smugglers would load their cargo on airplanes bound\nfor Toronto or Vancouver. Associates in Canada would drive the\ncargo in vans with tinted windows to this weathered rural Indian\nreservation, which straddles Canada and the United States. The\nsmugglers would hire Indians or other locals to transport the cargo\nby powerboat for a two-minute sprint across the cold, swirling St.\nLawrence River. And waiting on the opposite shore would be another\nvan, sometimes driven by another Indian, to take the cargo to New\nYork City.\n\n   ``They had it down to a science, whether crossing by daylight or\nby night,'' said Michael McLaughlin, assistant district director of\ninvestigations for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n``You're talking eight, 10, 15 people a trip, three or four times a\nweek.''\n\n   McLaughlin was referring not to the smugglers, but to the cargo:\nChinese nationals determined to sneak into the United States.\n\n   Over the last two years, authorities say, smugglers funneled\nmore than 3,600 illegal Chinese immigrants through the Indian\nreservation here, exploiting the region's complicated geographical\nand jurisdictional anatomy. For the smugglers, it was a lucrative,\nlow-risk endeavor that could take as little as a few days, from\nPoint A, in Fujian province in China, to Point Z, in Chinatown. For\nthe aliens, it was a life-altering odyssey marked by paranoia,\nhunger and hope.\n\n   Last week, however, U.S. and Canadian authorities announced that\nthey had cracked the smuggling ring, arresting 35 people, including\nseveral Indians, and indicting a dozen others. And in so doing,\nthey shed light on an operation that had become, quietly and almost\ninvisibly, an increasingly popular route for those smuggling\nChinese nationals.\n\n   At the same time, though, the crackdown has brought attention to\nan insular community that has long been branded as a silent partner\nfor smugglers trafficking in the latest profitable commodity, be it\ncigarettes, liquor or immigrants.\n\n   The truth is that most of the 8,000 people on this rugged,\nwind-swept reservation do not smuggle. Many did not even know that\nthe Chinese operation existed. Still, many of the Indians have a\ntremendous capacity to forgive, saying that in a hardscrabble place\nwhere unemployment is 30 percent, a person's decision to smuggle\nmust be framed in economic, not legal or moral, terms.\n\n   ``I wouldn't do it, but I understand the concept,'' said an\nunemployed social worker who was eating at the popular Bear's Den\nrestaurant on the American side. ``It's all about survival. If you\nhave three kids, and you have to pay the rent, and someone says\nthat all you've got to do is `Drive here, drive there, make a few\nthousand dollars,' I can see why you'd do it.''\n\n   Split evenly between the Akwesasne Reserve on the Canadian side,\nand the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation on the American side, the\nreservation is a jurisdictional jigsaw puzzle covering about 22\nsquare miles in two countries, two provinces (Ontario and Quebec)\nand one state (New York).\n\n   It is a place where the game of hide-and-seek is stacked against\nthe seeker. There are more than a dozen islands on either side of\nthe border, plus hundreds of coves and dozens of dirt roads leading\nto the St. Lawrence River. Abandoned farmhouses and shacks dot the\nflat terrain, which is stubbled with wheat fields and blanketed by\noaks and evergreens. Street lights are dim and sparse.\n\n   As a result, smugglers have often ushered illegal immigrants _\nmany from India, Pakistan or Poland _ through the reservation\nwithout much difficulty. These have usually been unorganized\noperations, run by freelancers in an anything-goes environment in\nwhich an illegal immigrant could almost ask someone, on the spot,\nfor a boat ride to the United States.\n\n   The Chinese smugglers, though, are different.\n\n   ``The Chinese are well organized,'' said Dick Ashlaw, patrol\nagent in charge of the U.S. Border Patrol in Massena, N.Y. ``And\nthe Chinese aliens are more terrified than the other aliens.\nThey're petrified.''\n\n   Law enforcement authorities said the Chinese smugglers would\nrecruit young, and mostly male, farmhands and laborers in Fujian,\npromising a prosperous life in America for an admission fee of\n$47,000 per person.\n\n   In Hong Kong, the smugglers would secure forged travel\ndocuments. Sometimes the Chinese would be shipped directly to\nCanada; other times, they would travel through another country,\nlike Germany, Morocco or Cuba.\n\n   Once in Canada, they would be crammed into safe houses in\nToronto; these were usually apartments or cheap motels. Smugglers\nwould buy street clothes for the Chinese to help them blend in. The\nsmugglers would also instruct the Chinese to avoid doing or saying\nanything that might jeopardize the operation _ or else risk harm to\ntheir families in China.\n\n   ``It was like a jail,'' said a businessman in Chinatown who has\ntalked to some aliens and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n``They had no freedom.''\n\n   Next, the smugglers would arrange for the aliens to be driven in\na minivan from Toronto to Cornwall, an industrial city bordering\nthe Indian reservation. The trip took about four hours.\n\n   The smugglers would usually drive to Cornwall Island on the\nCanadian side of the territory _ an island that can be reached\nbefore one hits the customs and immigration checkpoints on the\nCornwall International Bridge. The van would then stop at the end\nof any number of long hidden driveways leading to the water.\nQuietly, quickly, the Chinese would get out of the van and into 18-\nto 24-foot powerboats that could squeeze in eight to 24 people,\nsaid Cpl. Norm Turcotte of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n   After a quick dash across the river, the Chinese would jump out\nof the boat, and into another van. Then the van would speed away,\nusually heading east on Route 37 toward the Gov. Thomas Dewey\nThruway.\n\n   nn\n\n   For driving the boat, the Indians would receive about $500 or so\nper immigrant, and perhaps double that if he played chauffeur to\nNew York.\n\n   Weather permitting, these were usually evening appointments. But\nduring the winter, when the river froze over, smugglers would often\ntake a snowmobile, hitch a trailer to the back, pack the Chinese\ninside and drive across the river at all hours. Again, all in a\nmatter of minutes.\n\n   ``They're not here that long,'' said Wesley Benedict, chief of\npolice of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department. ``They\ndon't walk around on the streets, or go into restaurants.''\n\n   But of course, there were also times when things would go awry,\nwhen the smugglers would be delayed by botched logistics and police\nsightings. If they were lucky, the Chinese would stay in bunk beds\nin someone's cellar, or in cheap motels in Cornwall or Massena. If\nnot, they would be forced to stay in dilapidated farmhouses,\ntrailers or other shelter for a few days, said Police Chief Lewis\nMitchell of the Akwesasne Mohawk Police, on the Canadian side.\n\n   Those who became too cold, hungry or frustrated would wander the\nstreets, looking for a ride to New York. But they didn't get very\nfar.\n\n   Earlier this year, for instance, the U.S. Border Patrol picked\nup four Chinese women in their early 20s who had been abandoned by\nsmugglers. A smuggler in New York later posted $40,000 bond to win\ntheir release, and their case is pending.\n\n   Overall, smuggling by air still remains the preferred choice,\nsaid Peter Kwong, author of ``Forbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese\nImmigrants and American Labor'' (The New Press, 1997).\n\n   But in recent years, the Akwesasne route has become an\nincreasingly popular alternative, as evidenced by the growth in\narrests of Chinese immigrants trying to cross the border. American\nauthorities arrested 94 in 1998, up from 38 the year before _\nmaking the Chinese the leading nationality to be smuggled, Ashlaw\nsaid.\n\n   None of this would be possible, of course, without local\nassistance. And while most Indians and law enforcement officers\ninsist that only a small number participate, and that the topic of\nsmuggling is unfairly soiling the reservation's reputation, the\nfact remains that the Chinese have never had any problems finding\nhelp.\n\n   In interviews, many residents of the reservation said that while\nthey did not condone smuggling, they did not condemn the smugglers,\neither. Most smugglers, they say, are young and desperate, just\ntrying to make ends meet.\n\n   Helen Jacobs, manager of a gift shop on the American side of the\nreservation, knows a luckless married couple who were arrested on\ncharges of smuggling two weeks ago. ``They were just trying to keep\nit going, and they decided to play the game,'' she said softly.\n``It's hard, especially because there's no work right now.''\n\n   At the same time, more people are supplying police with tips\nabout immigrant smuggling. And law enforcement officials say that\nsuch cooperation, coupled with better coordination among the\nvarious governmental agencies, contributed to the recent arrests.\n\n   Even so, law enforcement officials say that catching one in 10\nillegal immigrants would be a coup.\n\n   On Tuesday night, two senior patrol agents, Dan Witkop and Ken\nStudlack, allowed two reporters to accompany them on their evening\nshift. It was routine at first, as the agents checked in with\nBenedict's police department, crisscrossed the reservation, peered\ninto minivans, checked license plates.\n\n   But at 10 p.m. or so, the agents were informed of a suspicious\nman of Polish extraction who said he wanted to cross the border and\nhead for a bar in Massena. This was notable, the agents said,\nbecause the night before, American authorities had picked up two\nillegal immigrants from Poland who were wandering on Route 37.\n\n   So for the next two hours, the agents, in an unmarked car,\nfollowed the man. And at first, he pulled into Bob's Motel, whose\nowner was recently indicted on charges of transporting an\nimmigrant. After a few minutes, the man left, pulled into a gas\nstation, stopped at a bar for a few minutes but did not get out of\nthe car, then returned to the motel. He checked in, and turned off\nthe lights.\n\n   Did he know he was being followed? Was he supposed to pick up an\nillegal immigrant en route to New York? Or was he just a bad driver\nwho got lost at every turn?\n\n   The agents never found out; they waited a couple of more hours\nand decided to call it a night.\n\n   ``Well,'' said Witkop, ``maybe next time.''\n","Headline":"\nSMUGGLERS USE INDIAN RESERVATION TO SNEAK CHINESE INTO U.S. \n","Text":["\n   ST.
