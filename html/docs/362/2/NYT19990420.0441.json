But they had precious little freedom and no\nopportunity.\n\n   Police and security guards apprehended the 19 Chinese males just\nafter they climbed out of a cargo container on the Sea-Land\nNavigator early Sunday morning in the Port of Tacoma.\n\n   They apparently are the customers of Chinese smugglers who are\nincreasingly using the giant container ships that ply the Pacific\nand visit West Coast ports for their human cargo.\n\n   ``This is part of a troubling trend,'' said Bob Coleman, deputy\ndistrict director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in\nSeattle. ``This fits an existing pattern of soft-top container\nsmuggling.''\n\n   The INS has had other cases in which Chinese citizens were\nsmuggled in in containers with tops made out of vinyl or other\nfabric, Coleman said. That allows air to get in so those being\nsmuggled can breathe.\n\n   In February, the INS and the U.S. Coast Guard discovered 11\nChinese nationals hidden in a cargo container on a Korean ship that\nhad just pulled into Long Beach, Calif.\n\n   Last summer, INS agents discovered an empty cargo container in\nTacoma, Wash., and evidence that people had been living in it\nduring the voyage across the Pacific. None of the stowaways was\nfound.\n\n   The Sea-Land Navigator, which can carry as many as 1,000 40-foot\ncontainers, made port calls in Hong Kong and Kao-hsiung in Taiwan\nin early April, said Clint Eisenhauer, a spokesman for Sea-Land\nService Inc. at its Charlotte, N.C., headquarters. The Korean ship\ncarrying the 11 Chinese apprehended in California also made stops\nat Hong Kong and Kao-hsiung.\n\n   ``This is very rare,'' Eisenhauer said. ``They are the first\nstowaways from Asia ever (for Sea-Land).''\n\n   The 19 males on the Sea-Land Navigator had food and water, but\nlittle else in the way of comforts. ``It's a horrible trip,''\nColeman said.\n\n   He said the stowaways agreed to pay as much as $40,000 to\nsmugglers to reach the United States. ``It's better than cocaine\nsmuggling,'' he said.\n\n   In past cases, Chinese citizens have made a down payment on the\ntrip, then promise to pay the rest after finding a job in the\nUnited States.\n\n   INS officials were questioning the 19 people Tuesday, trying to\ndetermine at which port they got into the cargo container and how\nthey managed to elude detection until they were caught.\n\n   The INS will decide what will become of the stowaways; most will\nlikely be deported.\n\n   At least one and as many of three are juveniles, an INS\nspokeswoman said.\n\n   The Navigator crossed the Pacific and arrived in Tacoma on\nSaturday, Eisenhauer said. Early Sunday morning, Tacoma police\nasked for help from port security to catch the stowaways.\n\n   Security guards found and stopped the 19 near the cargo\ncontainer.\n\n   Coleman said the agency is ``working strong investigative\nleads'' to determine if any of the 19 were smugglers or whether the\nsmugglers had local connections.\n\n   Chinese smugglers have become adept at bringing in illegal\naliens by air, sea and land. In the past year, law enforcement\nagents have discovered that:\n\n   - Smugglers were using a fishing boat to bring Chinese from\nSouth America, then transferring them to the United States by small\npower boats based in New Jersey.\n\n   - Chinese citizens were arriving in Vancouver, British Columbia,\nby air, then taken across Canada in a van. They were smuggled into\nthe United States through a Mohawk Indian Reservation along\nCanada's border with New York state. Soon, they were on their way\nto New York City.\n\n   - Moss Landing and Half Moon Bay in Northern California were\nused to smuggle in Chinese, whom smugglers turned into virtual\nslaves in the United States.\n","Headline":"\nSHIP'S CARGO CONTAINER USED TO SMUGGLE IN 19 CHINESE NATIONALS \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Nineteen people, including as many as three juveniles,\nendured two weeks stuffed into a cargo container on the rolling\ndecks of a freighter as it crossed the Pacific.\n","\n   It was an attempt to reach America, the land of freedom and\nopportunity.
