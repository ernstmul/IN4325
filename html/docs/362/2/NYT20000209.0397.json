But\nthis time, their tactics have grown more sophisticated _ and\npotentially more dangerous.\n\n   Last weekend, immigration officials took 15 Chinese stowaways\ninto custody on Los Angeles' Terminal Island. All had made the\npassage across the Pacific in a hard-topped container specially\nequipped with secret doors, lights and fans.\n\n   Immigration officials said the discovery was the first evidence\nthat smugglers are turning to hard-topped containers.\n\n   ``This was a signal that they are trying to figure out a new way\nto smuggle people in,'' said Sharon Gavin, spokeswoman for the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service's Western regional office in\nCalifornia.\n\n   It was the first container smuggling in a month after a rash of\nsoft-topped container smuggling on the West Coast in December and\nJanuary.\n\n   INS officials had warned that the smugglers were likely going to\nchange tactics away from soft-topped containers, but not quit. The\nprofit is too high, they said. Indeed, the 15 people caught in Los\nAngeles agreed to pay up to $60,000 apiece to get to America.\n\n   Someone had cut two doors, each 3 feet by 2 feet, on the\ncontainer's sides. Hinges were placed inside. Paint and epoxy\napplied outside the container camouflaged the doors, Gavin said.\n\n   Inside, the immigrants _ 14 men and a 16-year-old boy _ had\nlights and fans powered by car batteries. They had bottled water,\ncanned juice and produce to drink and eat. There were four\n30-gallon containers for waste.\n\n   ``This was a very sophisticated effort,'' Gavin said.\n\n   In December and January, more than 140 Chinese stowed away on\neight different ships that arrived at West Coast ports from Hong\nKong. Four ships arrived at Seattle. On one, three of the 18\nstowaways died during the voyage. The cause of death is still being\ninvestigated.\n\n   Smugglers used soft-topped containers in December and January.\nTheir plan was that after the container was unloaded, the\nimmigrants would cut their way out of the soft top and escape.\n\n   In a hard-topped container, immigrants are essentially entombed\nwith no way of getting out until someone outside opens it or unless\nsomeone cuts a secret door.\n\n   The container that carried the 15 stowaways had been loaded on\nAPL's President Polk on Jan. 23 in Hong Kong, supposedly carrying\ntoys.\n\n   ``It's always troubling when any third party uses your system\nfor purposes that we didn't intend,'' said John Pachtner, a\nspokesman for APL (formerly American President Lines), at its\nOakland, Calif., headquarters. ``All carriers are working with the\nauthorities to try and address this ongoing issue.''\n\n   In several recent cases, INS agents had been tipped off about\nthe smuggling and were waiting on the docks for the container ship\nto arrive. In some cases, agents even could ask for the container\nby its serial number.\n\n   But the President Polk arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday\nmorning without the INS waiting for it. The immigrants got out of\nthe container apparently unseen. Security officers found them\nSaturday night wandering around Terminal Island, Gavin said.\n\n   The 15 immigrants were in an INS detention center in Lancaster,\nCalif., Wednesday. Like the other stowaways, they are from China's\ncoastal Fujian province.\n\n   The container smuggling stopped after Jan. 11. INS agents\nworking with Hong Kong authorities had found out which ships were\ncarrying stowaways. American agents also hoped that bad publicity\nfrom arrests and deaths would dissuade others from stowing away on\ncontainers.\n\n   What's more, the government of Hong Kong launched a program to\ninspect all soft-topped containers and use carbon-dioxide and heat\ndetectors to find stowaways.\n\n   Large cargo ships carry only a handful of soft-topped\ncontainers, making inspections easy. But vessels like the President\nPolk can carry thousands of 20-and 40-foot hard-topped containers,\nso detection has become more difficult, Gavin said.\n\n   She said INS officials also worry about the safety of stowaways\non hard-topped containers. Secret doors may not operate. There may\nnot be any doors. The stowaways could be left on the dock in a\nlocked, hard-topped container to suffocate.\n\n   About 60 stowaways remain in detention in the Seattle area. They\nare expected to seek asylum and will likely have asylum hearings\nover the next two weeks.\n","Headline":"\nSMUGGLERS OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS REFINE TACTICS \n","Text":["\n   Chinese smugglers who use cargo containers on freighters to\nbring immigrants illegally into the United States are back.
