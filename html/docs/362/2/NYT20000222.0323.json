Most of the females are\nlured by false promises of legitimate work, he said.\n\n   Loy and other officials said gangs of smugglers linked to\norganized crime keep the girls and women in their control through\nbeatings, rape, psychological intimidation, confiscation of\npassports and threats to relatives back home.

She said she had already worked in the brothels, and\nit did me no good to complain.''\n\n   So, Inez said, she plunged into the terrifying world of forced\nprostitution. Condoms with torn wrappers were sent back to the\nsmugglers and served as tickets for $25 deductions from the\nsmuggling debt.\n\n   Inez and the other women and girls _ some as young as 14 _\nworked six days a week, 12 hours a day, and were ferried from place\nto place, she said. Beatings and rapes by the smugglers were\ncommonplace. Those who became pregnant were forced to get\nabortions, with the abortion fee added to the smuggling debt, she\nadded.\n\n   After a few months police and FBI and Immigration and\nNaturalization Service agents raided the brothel.
