He and another\nHong Kong officer have been in Seattle the past few days sharing\nintelligence on immigrant smuggling with law enforcement officials.\n\n   ``Hong Kong is taking this very, very seriously. Once the\ncontainers started arriving (in the United States), everybody got\ninvolved: Customs, immigration, Hong Kong police,'' said Bancroft,\na Canadian who works on contract with the police.\n\n   Immigration agents took the 19 found Tuesday into custody. As\nwith three previous human smuggling incidents during the past two\nweeks in Seattle, immigration agents had been tipped off and were\nwaiting for the Hanjin Yokohama, which left Hong Kong on Dec. 27,\nto arrive.\n\n   So Kam-shing, Hong Kong's principal secretary for security, said\nin a news release Tuesday that his government alerted officials\nhere. In some cases, U.S. immigration agents have been tipped off\nto the serial number of the container that has stowaways inside.\n\n   All 19 of the stowaways discovered Tuesday were in reasonably\ngood health. Monday, agents discovered three dead stowaways and 15\nothers in weak condition on a container taken from the NYK Cape\nMay. The three dead stowaways are all men. Immigration officials\nerroneously reported Monday that one was a woman.\n\n   The FBI, which has jurisdiction over deaths on the high seas, is\ninvestigating. There are no signs of foul play.\n\n   An FBI spokeswoman said the ships' crew, shipping agents and\nothers could be held criminally liable only if investigators can\nprove they took some action to further the smuggling operation.\n\n   Autopsies at the King County Medical Examiner's Office on\nTuesday showed that the three men did not die of injury or disease.\nInvestigator David Delgado said further tests will be conducted to\ndetermine cause of death, with results expected in four to five\nweeks.\n\n   Survivors told immigration agents Monday that the men had died\nthree to seven days ago, said Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n   The container had been sealed and left at the port of Hong Kong\nseveral days before being loaded on the Cape May, Gavin said.\n\n   During the voyage, the 18 men suffered from sea sickness and\neventually ran out of most of their food and water. Their\nsoft-topped container was in the hold of the ship. Four containers\nwere stacked above it.\n\n   ``They were virtually entombed,'' said Virginia Kice, another\nINS spokeswoman.\n\n   Seven of the survivors remained at Harborview Medical Center\nhere Tuesday. The hospital listed all seven, who suffered from\nmalnourishment and dehydration, in satisfactory condition.\n\n   INS officials hope news of the tragedy deters other Chinese\nnationals from following suit. In the past year, West Coast ports\nhave seen a rash of container smuggling. There have been 14\ninstances involving more than 200 stowaways since February at\nVancouver, B.C., Seattle, Tacoma and Long Beach, Calif.\n\n   In some instances, stowaways have emerged well-fed and in good\nhealth, appearing in creased khakis and carrying cellular phones.\n\n   Conditions, however, often are ghastly _ a dozen or more men\ncrowd inside a 40-foot container and live there for two weeks.\nStowaways have food and water and often a crude source of light.\n\n   ``We want to do everything we can to publicize in this country\nthe tragedy that happened and also spread the word\ninternationally,'' Kice said.\n\n   Immigration officials in Seattle have said at least two Hong\nKong shipping companies _ Yuk Yat Trading and Lap Kei Trading _\nwere responsible for sending containers bearing stowaways to\nWashington state. Bancroft said those companies are bogus.\n\n   He also said inspecting soft-topped containers _ used because\nthey can be easily opened for ventilation and escape _ should be\neasy. There are only a few soft-topped containers on cargo ships\nthat typically carry thousands of the 20- and 40-foot boxes.\n\n   In the past, companies have been able to lease the containers in\nHong Kong, take them away from the port and fill them, Bancroft\nsaid. Then they are returned to the port in Hong Kong and not\nopened before loading on a ship.\n\n   The smugglers' plan in the United States, immigration officials\nsay, is to have the containers unloaded but not picked up. After\nthe docks are quiet, the stowaways cut a hole in the cloth-top\ncontainer and flee.\n\n   Yu Shuing, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,\nD.C., said the Chinese government has strengthened its garrison in\nthe coastal province of Fujian in an effort to crack down on\nsmuggling.\n\n   But he said the illegal departure of the stowaways may be one of\nthe prices China must pay for creating a more open country over the\npast two decades.\n\n   ``People are now free to move anywhere to find work, and China\nis very open now,'' Yu said. ``That's why people have many more\nopenings for getting out of the country.''\n\n   Bancroft said Hong Kong has been chosen as a starting point\nbecause it one of the few ports in China where vessels leave\ndirectly for the United States.\n\n   In the past, smugglers have used fishing boats and other vessels\nto bring over hundreds of immigrants at a time. But smugglers have\nchanged their tactics.\n\n   Smuggling by container is better for stowaways in the winter,\nand it's lucrative, Bancroft said.\n\n   It costs $8,000 to ship a container from Hong Kong to Seattle,\nand those smuggled are charged $40,000 to $60,000 apiece.\n\n   The illegal immigrants being detained in Seattle are from the\nFujian Province, in coastal China not far from Taiwan. Fujian has a\nlong history of sending out immigrants around the world and of\nsmuggling. Successful immigrants send back money, persuading even\nmore people to leave.\n\n   It is said that you can sit in a tea house or cafe there and\nlisten as customers discuss human smuggling plans, Bancroft said.\n\n   Behind those immigrants is a network of smugglers. Bancroft said\none or two crime syndicates seem to be at work sending stowaways on\ncontainers to the United States.\n\n   The network is complicated. Immigrants have to be smuggled into\nHong Kong. Even though Hong Kong is part of China, it takes special\npermission from the government for Chinese from other parts of the\ncountry to be there.\n\n   Fujian residents arrested on the U.S. West Coast may be\ndeported.\n\n   Yu, the embassy spokesman, said once the Chinese citizenship of\nthe stowaways is documented, China hopes to work closely with the\nUnited States to see that they are repatriated.\n\n   They face a fine and re-education course, in which they would\nface criticism from local leaders in Fujian.\n\n   ``Local leadership will trying to show them their mistake; they\nwill perhaps be fined and then they will be freed,'' Yu said.\n\n   He blames the false promises of Chinese smugglers called\n``snakeheads,'' who are telling people that in America ``they can\nmake a fortune _ maybe a million dollars _ in two, three or five\nyears.''\n\n   The stowaways have been led to believe it will be relatively\neasy to get political asylum in the United States by claiming they\nare fleeing China's one-child-per-family rule, Yu said.\n\n   Attorneys who have represented people who have been smuggled\nfrom China to the United States say that some are legitimately\nfleeing family-planning rules.\n\n   ``Political asylum is the claim that most of them make,'' said\nJules Coven, a New York attorney. ``The major thrust right now is\nthat they are afraid of the Chinese one-child family planning\npolicy.''\n\n   Women or married men can file a refugee claim based on the\none-child policy, which Coven says has resulted in forced abortions\nand sterilizations.\n\n   ``If they are believed by the judge, then they will have a\nsuccessful refugee claim,'' Coven said. ``It's not automatic that\nall of them will be deported.''\n\n   P-I reporters Ruth Teichroeb, Heath Foster and Vanessa Ho\ncontributed to this report.\n","Headline":"\nHONG KONG VOWS TO CRACK DOWN ON SMUGGLING: 19 MORE STOWAWAYS\nFOUND \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Alarmed by a sudden and sometimes tragic string of\nhuman smuggling cases from its shores, Hong Kong authorities\npledged Tuesday to crack down on stowaways on container ships.\n","\n   Hong Kong officials said customs agents will inspect every\nsoft-top cargo container and that carbon-dioxide and heat detectors\nwill be used to search for stowaways.\n","\n   Shipping companies have agreed to report suspicious cargo and to\ncheck on new clients.\n","\n   Even as officials made those pledges, immigration agents here\nfound yet another container loaded with Chinese illegal immigrants.\nNineteen men were in a container taken off the Hanjin Yokohama at 5\na.m. Tuesday.\n","\n   ``I think this will be the last one coming out of Hong Kong _\nknock on wood,'' said Todd Bancroft, detective senior inspector in\nthe organized crime bureau of the Hong Kong police.
