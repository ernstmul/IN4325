HOLMES   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and Canadian authorities announced Thursday\nthat they had broken up a sophisticated ring that smuggled Chinese\nimmigrants into the United States, and ultimately to New York City,\nthrough a Mohawk Indian reservation along the border.\n\n   Authorities said the ring, made up primarily of Chinese\nnationals and members of the Mohawk tribe, transported more than\n3,600 Chinese immigrants across the lightly patrolled border along\nthe St. Lawrence River and into upstate New York during the last\ntwo years.\n\n   Officials said that 47 people had been indicted for conspiracy\nto smuggle aliens into the United States. Of those, 35 have been\narrested.\n\n   ``This is the first large-scale alien smuggling operation we\nhave encountered on the northern border,'' Doris Meissner,\ncommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in\nannouncing the indictments.\n\n   Only about a dozen of the immigrants who were smuggled in have\nbeen taken into custody. Officials said the immigrants, primarily\nyoung men from Fujian Province, paid as much as $47,000 for the\njourney from China.\n\n   Ms. Meissner said she had no information on what types of\ncompanies or businesses the aliens worked in once they arrived in\nNew York City.\n\n   The break-up of the ring comes three weeks after Attorney\nGeneral Janet Reno announced cracking the largest immigrant\nsmuggling ring to be dismantled in the nation _ an operation that\nbrought in more than 12,000 people, mainly Indians, Pakistanis,\nSyrians and Afghans during the last three years.\n\n   Thursday's announcement highlighted the extent to which the\n28-square mile Indian reservation, which straddles two Canadian\nprovinces and one U.S. state, has become a haven for smugglers. The\nfoggy creeks and wooded islands featured on the Indian territory,\nwhich is known as the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation on the U.S. side\nand the Akwesasne Indian Territory in Canada, have long been used\nto spirit gasoline, cigarettes, tobacco and drugs between the two\ncountries.\n\n   In recent years, more and more of the contraband has been human.\n\n   ``The geography of the Akwesasne is perfect for smuggling,''\nsaid Thomas Maroney, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of\nNew York. ``It's in Canada. It's in the United States. It's in\nOntario. It's in Quebec. A look at a map shows you how easy it is\nto use the place as a vehicle for smuggling. It isn't just aliens,\nthough that's what we're involved with here. There have been cases\nof alcohol and tobacco going north and drugs going both ways.''\n\n   Officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the\ninvestigation into the smuggling ring began with a tip they\nreceived 18 months ago. But the transport of illegal immigrants\nacross the Mohawk territory was widely known in the reservation and\nsurrounding territories.\n\n   Last year, a Pakistani woman drowned when a smuggler's rickety\nboat capsized in rough waters between Corwall Island, part of the\nIndian territory in Canada, and the U.S. mainland. And residents of\nthe reservation say they are used to seeing Asian people traveling\nacross their land at all hours of the day or night, easily evading\nthe 40-officer tribal police force.\n\n   ``You go outside and it's not uncommon to see people of a\ndifferent color going through,'' said Joyce Mitchell, a spokeswoman\nfor the Mohawk National Council of Chiefs.\n\n   Last year Canadian police broke a smaller immigrant smuggling\nring that was importing Chinese nationals, sending some into the\nU.S. through the Mohawk reservation but keeping most of the aliens\nin Canada. The tip Canadian authorities received involved\ninformation that not all the top people in that ring had been\ncaptured and that a similar and larger operation was still\nfunctioning. Thursday's announcement concerned that second\nsyndicate.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Authorities said that the ring transported immigrants through\nHong Kong and Taipei and a number of intermediate countries,\nincluding Germany, Brazil, Morocco, France, Greenland and Cuba.\nOnce in Toronto or Vancouver, the aliens took advantage of Canada's\nrelatively liberal refugee laws and gained entry by claiming to be\nfleeing persecution in China.\n\n   Last year, 24,852 individuals applied to Canada's Immigration\nand Refugee Board for asylum. The board, a quasi-governmental body,\napproved 10,042. But, officials say, it can take up to 12 months to\nget a hearing on a refugee claim. In the interim there are no\nrestrictions on the applicant's freedom. Officials could not say\nhow many of those whose claims were rejected had been removed from\nCanada.\n\n   In contrast, individuals who seek asylum in the United States\nare incarcerated while awaiting a hearing on their claim.\n\n   Canadian police officials said that while waiting for their\nhearings the aliens who had been brought to Toronto and Vancouver\nby the smuggling ring melted into the large Asian populations in\nthose cities. Eventually they were driven to Corwall Island,\nOntario, in the St. Lawrence River about 50 miles southwest of\nMontreal.\n\n   Smugglers then moved the immigrants by boat to the Mohawk\nreservation in upstate New York or to a swatch of Indian territory\nin Quebec on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, where they can\neasily cross into the United States.\n\n   Under an agreement the tribe has with the U.S. and Canadian\ngovernments, there are no border controls between the Quebec and\nNew York sections of the reservation.\n","Headline":"\nARRESTS MADE IN SMUGGLING OF IMMIGRANTS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and Canadian authorities announced Thursday\nthat they had broken up a sophisticated ring that smuggled Chinese\nimmigrants into the United States, and ultimately to New York City,\nthrough a Mohawk Indian reservation along the border.\n","\n   Authorities said the ring, made up primarily of Chinese\nnationals and members of the Mohawk tribe, transported more than\n3,600 Chinese immigrants across the lightly patrolled border along\nthe St. Lawrence River and into upstate New York during the last\ntwo years.\n","\n   Officials said that 47 people had been indicted for conspiracy\nto smuggle aliens into the United States.
