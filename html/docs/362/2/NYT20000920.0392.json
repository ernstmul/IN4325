Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors on Wednesday accused one of New\nYork City's busiest immigration law firms of working hand in hand\nwith the smugglers who bring illegal immigrants from China and then\nkeep them as virtual indentured servants in the United States until\nthe price of their passage is repaid.\n\n   In two indictments filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,\nthe government described the Manhattan law firm of Robert E. Porges\nas a racketeering enterprise and accused Porges; his wife, Sheery\nLu; and six current and former employees of receiving $1.2 million\nin fees from unnamed smugglers over the last seven years.\n\n   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of\nNew York, said that in return for that money, the firm acted as an\nadviser to smugglers, even suggesting the best points of entry into\nthe country to avoid detection and arranging transportation to New\nYork City for immigrants who had succeeded in sneaking into the\ncountry by land or sea.\n\n   She also said some law firm employees, mainly under the\ndirection of Mrs. Porges, helped the smugglers seize the illegal\nimmigrants upon arrival in the city and hold them as ``hostages''\nuntil the $40,000 to $50,000 they had promised to pay for their\npassage was paid.\n\n   After a brief hearing following the unsealing of the grand jury\nindictments, Porges, 62, was released and given two weeks to post a\n$2 million bond on behalf of himself and his wife. She was ordered\nheld until the bond was posted.\n\n   No pleas were entered at the hearing, and Porges did not speak\nto reporters. He appeared pale and shaken.\n\n   Nicholas Kaiser, his lawyer, said, ``We're confident that after\na speedy trial, Mr. Porges will be shown to have represented his\nclients honestly and ethically for over 40 years.''\n\n   Although the law firm and some of its employees are accused of\nhaving direct contact with smugglers and helping them ``abduct''\nillegal immigrants, no one is named in the indictment as a\nsmuggler.\n\n   White said that at least one person already convicted of\nimmigrant smuggling in the last few years was connected to the\nPorges firm.\n\n   But she refused to provide specifics or explain the genesis of\nthe case. She would not say whether any more people would be\ncharged with smuggling, abducting or holding immigrants hostage in\nconnection with the case.\n\n   Many of the Chinese men and women who enter the United States\nillegally end up in New York sweatshops and restaurants, where they\nwork long hours in sometimes dangerous conditions for years to pay\nback the smugglers _ often referred to as ``snakeheads'' _ who\nbrought them from their homeland.\n\n   Failure to pay the snakehead or attempts to escape from a\nsmuggler's control can bring retribution against family members\nback in China, according to social service groups and academics who\nwork with Chinese immigrants.\n\n   The central figure in the case is Mrs. Porges, 47. Prosecutors\ncalled her the ``chief of staff'' of the operation and charged her\nwith aiding snakeheads in the kidnapping of 17 Chinese immigrants\nsince 1997.\n\n   Her husband, however, who has represented Chinese immigrants in\nmany of the country's highest-profile asylum cases, was not accused\nof participating in the seizure of immigrants who owed money to the\nsmugglers.\n\n   ``Mr. Porges worked as much as possible from behind the\nscenes,'' White said. ``Porges' wife allegedly functioned as the\nenterprise's chief of staff and liaison to the Chinese community.''\n\n   Others charged with membership in the racketeering operation are\nRity Sulan Peng, 26, a paralegal; Heidi He, 34, the law firm's\noffice manager; June Liu, 37, a translator; Jin Wen Shan, 37, a\nmember of the support staff; and a staff member identified only as\nMichael, whose last name was not known by the prosecutors.\n\n   A separate indictment charging two former law firm employees\nwith aiding in immigrant smuggling named Peng and Jeffrey Tse, 45.\n\n   Porges, while charged with racketeering, is mainly accused of\ndirecting his staff to concoct stories of past persecution on\nbehalf of clients who were seeking asylum to legally remain in the\nUnited States.\n\n   Immigrants, even those who arrive illegally, are entitled to\nrequest political asylum on the ground that they would face\npersecution if forced to return home.\n\n   The Porges firm, which employed about 40 lawyers and paralegal\nworkers, handled thousands of such cases over the years. Robert\nPorges represented many of the Chinese who survived the Golden\nVenture shipwreck off the Rockaway peninsula in Queens in 1993 in\ntheir asylum applications, as well as some of those who were caught\noff the coast of New Jersey in 1998 after their smugglers' boat ran\naground.\n\n   He also represented several Chinese teen-agers abducted from\nfoster homes in Seattle in 1995 and held for ransom in connection\nwith an unpaid debt to a snakehead. At the time, an Immigration and\nNaturalization Service official credited Porges with reporting one\nof the kidnappings to authorities.\n\n   The indictments came after a 30-month investigation led by the\nINS.\n\n   The commissioner of immigration, Doris Meissner, described the\nindictments as a significant blow to the multibillion-dollar\nbusiness of smuggling illegal immigrants. The accused lawyers and\nlegal assistants, she said, may be ``Manhattan attorneys in\nthree-piece suits, but the people indicted today are just as\nruthless and unscrupulous as the snakeheads with whom they\ncollaborated for profit.''\n\n   The Porges law firm was accused of receiving direct payments\nfrom unnamed smugglers and receiving about $12 million since 1993\nfrom about 6,000 asylum seekers whose applications, according to\nthe indictments, contained false information.\n\n   That number does not represent all the asylum cases handled by\nthe firm, according to INS officials, and not all of the Porges\ncases are suspect.\n\n   But the issue of how lawyers help and even coach an asylum\nseeker _ as Porges is accused of doing _ to make a case is\nsensitive.\n\n   Most immigration lawyers, as well as numerous charitable and\nsocial service agencies, handle large caseloads of asylum\napplications from Chinese immigrants and others.\n\n   Some said illegal immigrants were often prepared by the\nsmugglers _ even before they see a lawyer _ to offer a false or\ntoo-pat story of persecution, and do not know their rights.\n\n   That makes them doubly vulnerable, said Jacqueline Baronian,\nchairwoman of the New York chapter of the American Immigration\nLawyers Association, who added that she did not know Porges or the\ndetails of the charges against him.\n\n   ``One of the biggest problems with these people who abuse\nimmigrants and take advantage,'' she said, ``is that unfortunately,\nthere are times when some of these aliens have very, very valid\nasylum claims.
