CHEN   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ Intensifying their investigation of the smuggling\nof Chinese immigrants into the United States, a federal prosecutor\nsaid Tuesday that one of the crew members of a smuggling ship that\nran aground in New Jersey had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges\nand another was expected to plead guilty later this week.\n\n   At the same time, the prosecutor, Carolyn Murray, an assistant\nU.S. attorney in New Jersey, said that the 23 Chinese immigrants\nwho arrived aboard that smuggling ship and have since been detained\nby the authorities as witnesses in the federal investigation would\nprobably be released on bond soon. Beginning next week, the federal\ngovernment plans to take depositions from some of the 23 in a\nprocess that should take several weeks, and at its conclusion, will\nallow the immigrants to be released.\n\n   ``The whole purpose of the depositions is to keep the amount of\ntime they spend in custody as witnesses to a minimum,'' Ms. Murray\nsaid after a calendar conference with defense lawyers before Judge\nDickinson Debevoise in U.S. District Court here. So far, the\nillegal immigrants have been detained for more than two months.\n\n   Tuesday's proceeding was not a formal hearing; it was more a\nmatter of legal necessity to coordinate schedules and logistics as\nthe summer winds down. Even so, the conference hinted at how the\ngovernment is proceeding with its investigation into the smuggling\nof illegal immigrants, and what lies ahead for the principal\nplayers involved.\n\n   The federal government is investigating the events surrounding\nthe evening of May 30, when a power boat carrying the illegal\nimmigrants ran aground in a soupy fog in the affluent town of Bay\nHead, N.J., some eight miles north of the intended destination,\nBelmar, N.J.\n\n   The case attracted additional attention, no doubt, because of\nits parallels with the case of Golden Venture, a larger ship that\nwas carrying 286 illegal Chinese immigrants when it sputtered to a\nhalt in Queens in 1993. There was cruel coincidence, too: The name\nof the powerboat in this case was the Oops II.\n\n   Last month, the federal government indicted six men in a\nconspiracy to smuggle the 23 Chinese men into the United States.\nThe six were accused of participating in an international smuggling\noperation that solicited as much as $40,000 apiece from anyone\ninterested in being taken from Fujian province in southern China\nvia South America to the United States.\n\n   Five of the six are being held without bail in New Jersey jails;\nthe other, Charng Seon Choi, is still at large. One man facing\nsmuggling charges, Kim Jong Che, has said that he was born in Korea\nbut lives in Venezuela, while the backgrounds and residences of the\nother defendants remain unclear.\n\n   But last week, another of the six, Cho Yang Nam, pleaded guilty\nto one conspiracy charge, acknowledging that he plotted with\nunnamed others to smuggle the Chinese immigrants, according to\ncourt documents. He has since agreed to cooperate with\ninvestigators, which could pare his sentence from its maximum of 10\nyears in jail and a $250,000 fine, the documents show.\n\n   Cho's guilty plea was not disclosed until Tuesday, however,\nbecause of case strategy, Ms. Murray said. Another man accused of\nsmuggling, Nam Jick Cho of Bayside, Queens, may plead guilty this\nweek, she said.\n\n   Neither of the Chos _ who prosecutors say are not believed to be\nrelated _ appeared in court Tuesday. But the other three accused\nmen in custody _ Che, Piao Zhen Jia and Jiang Yong Zhu _ did show\nup in the courtroom, looking stone-faced while listening to a\ntranslator. The trial is scheduled to being on Nov. 17.\n\n   As for the illegal immigrants, they were first held in an\nImmigration and Naturalization Service detention center in\nElizabeth, N.J. Most were released in mid-July on bond by two\nimmigration judges, only to be immediately rearrested by federal\nauthorities as witnesses in the federal investigation.\n\n   For now, the 23 men remain in government custody, most in the\nPassaic County Jail. But some of the men briefly escaped the\nloneliness of being imprisoned in a foreign land when they were\nreunited last month with several relatives who appeared in\nimmigration court in Elizabeth to offer testimony to support the\nmen's release on bond.\n\n   Now, the prospect of reunions lasting more than a few minutes,\nand occurring outside of a courtroom, looms larger.
