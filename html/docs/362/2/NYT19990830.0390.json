Then, on Aug. 19, federal prosecutors in Atlanta\nunsealed indictments accusing 13 people of smuggling Asian girls\nand women into a life of forced prostitution in Atlanta and DeKalb\nCounty.\n\n   Since the late 1980s, thousands of people from rural China have\npromised to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers to bring them to\nthe United States and other countries. They spend years after they\narrive working in conditions of indentured servitude to repay their\ndebts.\n\n   In the early and mid-1990s, smugglers on the way to New York\nCity brought their cargo through Hartsfield International Airport\nin Atlanta, said Peter Kwong, a Hunter College professor and author\nof a book on immigrant smuggling. Smugglers who went from China to\nCentral or South America and then crossed the Mexican border also\ncaught flights for New York from cities such as Houston and\nAtlanta, he said.\n\n   Atlanta now has a large enough Chinese community to include\nunderground employment agencies that match smuggled immigrants with\nChinese restaurateurs and other businesspeople looking for cheap\nlabor, Kwong said. Smugglers, known as ``snakeheads,'' have arrived\nin metro Atlanta to make sure the illegal immigrants pay their\ndebts, said Kwong and Marc Johnson, police chief of Chamblee, one\nof the most ethnically diverse cities in Georgia.\n\n   Asian businesspeople in Chamblee say snakeheads tell them to\n``hire these people (smuggled from China) or else,'' Johnson said.\nThe businesspeople, he said, ``don't take them as idle threats'' _\nthey comply whether or not they need employees, he said, because\nthey fear violence if they resist.\n\n   ``There's no question it's going on'' in Georgia, Johnson said.\nAboard a smuggling ship\n\n   Experts say thousands of Chinese sneak out of their country each\nyear and often wind up working in conditions of indentured\nservitude to repay typical smuggling fees of $30,000 to $35,000,\ncosts that are 75 to 88 times higher than the average Chinese\nincome of $400 a year.\n\n   Most passengers come from Fujian, a coastal province of 30\nmillion people in southeastern China with a history of migration,\nseafaring and overseas trade. Snakeheads offer hope to people in a\ncountryside of grinding poverty that benefited at first from\nfree-market reforms but saw its industrial experiment founder when\nforeign investment poured into Fujian's big cities.\n\n   ``People go to the villages and tell them what opportunities\nthey have in the U.S.,'' said Lani Wong, president of the Georgia\nchapter of the National Association of Chinese-Americans. ``They\nall think the United States is a golden opportunity. They don't\nknow that they'll probably end up working in a sweatshop.''\n\n   They have been found in recent years in or near California,\nCanada, Georgia, Guam, Japan, the Northern Mariana Islands, Midway\nIsland, New Jersey, New York and Washington state.\n\n   The trips can be deadly. In June 1993, after the decrepit\nfreighter Golden Venture ran aground in New York Harbor, many of\nthe 300 Chinese on board leapt into the water to swim to freedom.\nSeven drowned or died of hypothermia in a case that focused\nnational attention on human smuggling. Twenty-two people pleaded\nguilty to organizing the trip.\n\n   The stowaways on the Prince Nicolas were found beneath a hatch\nthat was bolted shut and covered with rope behind a locked door in\na part of the ship often filled with water to help it balance.\nThree levels of wooden platforms used as bunks extended off\ndifferent sides of a ladder descending into the bowels of the ship.\n\n   On other ships, investigators found dank living quarters where\nstowaways ate meager portions of rice and gruel from bowls nailed\nto tables. Federal agents have described opening a secret hatch and\nbeing overcome by the stench of urine, feces and vomit. ``A\nshameful practice''\n\n   Researchers say the trips began after 1986, when the U.S.\nCongress granted amnesty to illegal aliens who were here before\n1982. Organized crime groups linked to the heroin trade saw the\npotential for huge profits by smuggling people here and giving them\nfake documents so they could receive amnesty and become legal\nresidents.\n\n   Immigrants from Fujian ``are often the most ambitious,'' said\nDavid Kyle, a sociologist at the University of California at Davis,\nwho has written a book on immigrant smuggling. ``They're not the\npoorest of the poor.''\n\n   Even more immigrants from Fujian came to America after a\ndecision made in the White House a year after the June 4, 1989,\nmassacre of hundreds of pro-democracy protesters by government\nforces in Tiananmen Square, said Jana Mason of the U.S. Committee\nfor Refugees, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington D.C. She\nsaid an Executive Order signed by President George Bush made it\neasier for Chinese immigrants who feared persecution to receive\npolitical asylum. Suddenly Chinese immigrants were citing fear of\nforced abortion or sterilization _ the Chinese government limits\nmarried couples to one child _ in requests for asylum.\n\n   Many of those smuggled to New York City's Chinatown endure\n80-hour work weeks and face torture and beatings with stun guns,\nlead pipes and claw hammers if they do not repay the smugglers on\ntime, researchers say. In 1990 and 1991, New York police rescued\nthree Fujianese men who had been abducted, beaten and burned with\ncigarettes for failing to pay.\n\n   Efforts to crack down on immigrant smuggling are hampered, Kyle\nand Kwong say, by corruption in China and way stations around the\nglobe. Last week, the U.S. Embassy in Panama said top Panamanian\nofficials helped thousands of Chinese sneak into the United States.\n\n   The federal government has taken steps to combat smuggling. In\n1993, a few weeks after seven Chinese from the Golden Venture died\nwithin sight of America, President Clinton called immigrant\nsmuggling a ``major crime problem'' that engaged in ``a shameful\npractice of unspeakable ... exploitation.'' He proposed reforms\nCongress adopted in 1996, including increasing human-smuggling\nsentences from five to 10 years and letting prosecutors target\nsmugglers with wiretaps and anti-racketeering laws.\n\n   Smugglers discover Georgia\n\n   Stepped-up American patrols for smuggling ships in the Pacific\nhave sent many ships through the Atlantic and Caribbean, Kwong\nsaid. And trips by air have replaced sea voyages as the most\npopular smuggling method. Flights are more expensive but much safer\nfor the passengers.\n\n   The most recent exploitative enterprise in Georgia came to light\non Aug. 17, when federal prosecutors in Atlanta unsealed\nindictments accusing 13 people of smuggling Asian girls and women\nand forcing them to become prostitutes in Atlanta and DeKalb\nCounty. Prosecutors say snakeheads handed out forged identification\npapers and assigned agents known as jockeys to accompany the women\non flights from Asia. Court records say trip organizers often\nbought airline tickets in their own names and gave their gate\npasses to the women, relying on the inability of airline employees\nto distinguish between male and female Asian names.\n\n   In the Prince Nicolas case, agents of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service are trying to determine where the stowaways\nwere going and whether an employer awaited their arrival. The INS\nsaid it might make arrests if it identifies a business waiting for\nthe Prince Nicolas immigrants.\n\n   The seven facing charges in the Prince Nicolas case face up to\n30 years in prison and fines of $750,000.
