Times News Service   \n\n   SEATTLE _ Accommodations for the 15-day trip from Hong Kong were\na metal cargo container, covered by canvas and stacked atop several\nother such tractor-trailer-size boxes in the hold of a giant\nfreighter called the Cape May. The only light was from flashlights.\nHuman waste was deposited in buckets. Food, primarily boxes of\nvegetables, ran out at some point. The seas were particularly\nrough.\n\n   When the Cape May pulled into Seattle and the containers were\ntaken off late Monday afternoon, 15 men from China stumbled out of\nthe metal box, dazed, dehydrated and gravely hungry. The stowaways,\nillegal immigrants who had agreed to pay tens of thousands of\ndollars in future wages to smugglers, pointed to the garbage-strewn\ncontainer, indicating even grimmer news. Inside were the bodies of\nthree men who had died during the crossing.\n\n   ``These containers were designed to carry machinery and cargo _\nnot people,'' said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service. ``The people aboard the Cape May were\neffectively entombed.''\n\n   At least 10 times in recent weeks, officials at ports on the\nwest coast of the United States and Canada have found human beings\nin cargo containers, a reflection of an alarming new trend in\nsmuggling that has now turned deadly and of the extraordinary steps\nthat Chinese laborers are willing to take to reach North America\nand the jobs they are promised here.\n\n   There are almost certainly more instances in which such\ntravelers have managed to make it across without detection, as some\nfreighters carry 1,000 containers or more. There is no question\nthat more such human-laden boxes are on the way, officials say. At\n5 a.m. Tuesday, another 19 Chinese men, all relatively young and in\napparent good health, were discovered in a cargo container aboard\nthe Hanjin Yokohma, which had also sailed from Hong Kong. With\nAmerican and Canadian officials expressing shock at the recent\ndiscoveries, Hong Kong authorities pledged a crackdown Tuesday on\nthe illegal trafficking, which has been detected so far in\nfreighters arriving here and in Long Beach, Calif., and Vancouver,\nB.C. Conditions in the containers vary widely: some, with\nventilation punched through the canvas tops and with furniture and\nelectric heaters and lights, seem to be somewhat endurable. But in\nother cases, particularly aboard the Cape May, they are\nnightmarish.\n\n   Said Bob Coleman, the acting director of the immigration service\nin Seattle, of the Cape May stowaways: ``I've simply never seen\npeople so disoriented, so distraught.''\n\n   It is not clear yet whether the three dead people aboard the\nfreighter perished from exposure to the cold in their unheated\ncontainers, lack of water, or perhaps a combination of the two,\nofficials said Tuesday.\n\n   Of the 15 who survived the journey in the 40-foot-long, 8-foot\nwide metal box, seven remain in Harborview Medical Center in\nsatisfactory condition, all being treated for dehydration or\nmalnutrition, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for the hospital. Eight\nothers, able to eat solid food, were released Tuesday into the\ncustody of the immigration service.\n\n   Under American immigration laws, unless they can establish a\nwell-grounded fear of persecution in their native country, the\nstowaways will likely be deported to China in weeks.
