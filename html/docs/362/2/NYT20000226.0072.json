Times News Service   \n\n   HARSENS ISLAND, Mich. _ In the winter, the frozen river here\ncreaks and moans as if lost souls were being swept along by the\nrelentless current underneath the ice. It is this unlikely spot,\nwhere the St. Clair River separates this rural Michigan region from\nCanada, that has lately become a passageway for illegal immigrants.\n\n   Those who walk across at night, with Indian guides tapping a\nsteel pole on the sparkling, groaning ice, are usually relieved to\nhit solid land.\n\n   The most recent immigrant caught here was a Tunisian man who\nwalked across one night this month. ``He was telling me he was\nscared to death and the ice was cracking around him and he didn't\nknow if he was going to make it to the other side,'' said Richard\nH. Nemitz, the agent in charge of the U.S. Border Patrol station in\nnearby Marysville, who questioned the Tunisian. The two Indian\nguides tried to reassure him. ``They said it is no problem if you\ndrink,'' Nemitz said. ``But he was a Muslim, so he didn't want to\ndrink.''\n\n   In the past year, illegal immigration in this region ``has gone\nfrom nothing or close to nothing detected to 100 people,'' said\nMark W. Osler, assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of\nMichigan. ``You'd have to assume the majority of them we don't\ncatch,'' he said, but just since December, a Detroit grand jury has\nindicted 15 people on charges related to smuggling.\n\n   Illegal immigration is picking up here because of an unusual\ncross-cultural criminal alliance. According to federal court papers\nfiled in Detroit, a ring of Canadian Indians from Walpole Island,\njust across the river from here, has linked up with Chinese\nsmugglers to bring Asian immigrants into this rural region 35 miles\nnortheast of Detroit. Others cross here, too _ a man from the\nBahamas walked across the ice on Jan. 25, for instance _ but most\nof the illegal immigrants caught here are Chinese or Korean.\n\n   They come by boat in warmer weather or on foot on the coldest\nnights. Others run through a train tunnel that goes under the river\nand surfaces in Port Huron, 20 miles up the coast from here.\n\n   The Border Patrol has caught 22 people since the beginning of\nDecember, and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in\nthe Detroit office have caught an additional 20, said Brian G.\nSlonac, supervisory special agent in charge of the Detroit\nanti-smuggling unit. Since early January, Canadian authorities have\ncaught 19 Chinese on their way to the United States, including 10\nteen-age girls in a van headed for Walpole Island.\n\n   By the time the immigrants arrive here, they have neared the end\nof what can be a grueling journey. Most are on their way to New\nYork, by way of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver and then Michigan.\nAbout 80 percent of those caught were Chinese from Fujian province\nin southeastern China, across from Taiwan.\n\n   Most have bought fake passports and fly into Canada. But some of\nthose caught told of their wretched journeys by freighter from\nChina to the coast of British Columbia, according to documents\nfiled in the December indictment. They were locked in dark ship\ncompartments so small that there was no room to lie down during the\nmonthlong journey.\n\n   None of the immigrants are now in custody, and the Border Patrol\nwould not release their names.\n\n   Most immigrants agreed to pay smugglers $20,000 to $50,000 to\nget from their home countries to New York City. The going price for\nriver crossings here was $1,000 to $1,500. Most pay for the passage\nby pledging to work in low-paying jobs in the United States, Slonac\nsaid.\n\n   Many get through. The local border patrol office, with four\nofficers patrolling roughly 140 miles of the U.S.-Canada coastline,\nhas been struggling to keep up with the flow. Even if they catch\nillegal immigrants, the border patrol office here has no budget to\nput them in jail. So they are let go, with orders to appear at a\nhearing. Most do not show up.\n\n   The immigration office in Detroit typically releases illegal\nimmigrants on a $5,000 bond and orders them to attend a hearing.\nThose who believe they have a good case for political asylum\nusually attend the hearings, Slonac said.\n\n   Immigration experts said that this policy is a peculiarity of\nthe border area here.
