Times News Service   \n\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service has\nbegun deportation proceedings _ again _ against a Chinese man who\nhas tried twice in the last five years to sneak into the United\nStates aboard smuggling ships that ran aground, the man's lawyers\nsaid Thursday.\n\n   In 1993, Wang Wu Dong was a passenger on the Golden Venture, a\nfreighter loaded with 286 illegal Chinese immigrants that ran\naground in New York City. He failed to win asylum, and was deported\nonly months before Congress passed a law in 1996 that would have\nstrengthened his case for asylum.\n\n   Two weeks ago, Wang was a passenger on the Oops II, a powerboat\nloaded with 23 illegal Chinese immigrants that ran aground off the\nNew Jersey shore. The immigration service has notified Wang that he\nis not entitled to another hearing for asylum, based on a 1996 law\nthat calls for the deportation of any illegal immigrant who had\npreviously been deported.\n\n   ``He is not going to appear in front of any judge, because the\nINS wants to redeport him,'' said David Lee, a lawyer with The\nPorges Law Firm in New York, which is representing 22 of the 23\nimmigrants on the Oops II. ``We will challenge this.''\n\n   Lee spoke after nine of the 23 men _ not including Wang _ made\nbrief individual appearances before two immigration judges at a\ndetention center here. The rest of the detainees are expected to\nmake their appearances in court Friday.\n\n   Lee said Thursday that the men admitted that they entered the\nUnited States illegally on May 30 when their boat ran aground in\ndense fog near the affluent town of Bay Head. But because the men\nplan to seek asylum, Lee argued that the immigrants should be\nreleased on $5,000 bond.\n\n   Immigration-service lawyers opposed the men's release, saying\nthat their cases might be relevant to a continuing criminal\ninvestigation into Chinese smuggling operations and that the men's\nlives were in danger because they each owed up to $40,000 to the\nsmugglers.\n\n   ``There is a clear historical record of Chinese being smuggled\ninto the U.S., being released by INS, and being held hostage by\nsmuggling groups in order to secure their smuggling fee,'' said\nRussell Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the immigration service in\nWashington.\n\n   Judge Esmeralda Cabrera said that she was inclined to eventually\nrelease the men on bond, but was unsure whether $5,000 was the\nappropriate amount. She and Judge Mirlande Tadal ordered both sides\nto return to court in two weeks with more information about the\nimmigrants, including testimony from any relatives they may have in\nthe United States.\n\n   The nine men who appeared in court Thursday seemed calm and in\ngood health. Several of them said that a parent or an uncle had\narranged for them to be smuggled in. Most said that they had\nrelatives in the United States, including one who said that his\nbrother in Virginia was either applying for, or had already been\ngranted, asylum.\n","Headline":"\nINS MOVES TO DEPORT PERSISTENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT \n","Text":["\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service has\nbegun deportation proceedings _ again _ against a Chinese man who\nhas tried twice in the last five years to sneak into the United\nStates aboard smuggling ships that ran aground, the man's lawyers\nsaid Thursday.\n","\n   In 1993, Wang Wu Dong was a passenger on the Golden Venture, a\nfreighter loaded with 286 illegal Chinese immigrants that ran\naground in New York City.
