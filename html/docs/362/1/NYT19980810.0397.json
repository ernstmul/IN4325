The Coast Guard\ndelayed its rescue of 13 immigrants who were still stranded on the\nsandbar until a larger sheriff's boat arrived.\n\n   Five police agencies responded to the earliest report, which\ncame from a pre-dawn fisherman who flagged down a Jupiter patrol\nofficer at 4:55 a.m.\n\n   ``Our report was that people were screaming out in the water,''\nsaid Officer John Roberts of the U.S. Coast Guard based in Riviera\nBeach. A sheriff's helicopter pilot confirmed that from the air.\nThen another Jupiter patrol officer found two soaked Haitian males\nat the intersection of State Road A1A and Indiantown Road.\n\n   The surviving immigrants, including 19 who successfully swam to\nshore, told investigators that they paid $350 to board two boats at\nFreeport, Bahamas, at 9 p.m. Sunday, the sheriff's office said.

In October 1981, 33 Haitian immigrants\ndrowned after their leaky, wooden sailboat broke up in rough surf\nless than a half-mile from the Hillsboro Beach in Broward County.\nThe 34 others aboard the boat survived.\n\n   The most recent drownings were in 1994 when four immigrants\ndrowned off the Martin County coast after a smuggler known as\nCaptain Jump Off made the immigrants get out in the ocean.\nOfficials have been looking for that captain, Richard B. Barker, of\nWest Palm Beach. A federal arrest warrant was issued for his arrest\non Feb. 20, but he disappeared.
