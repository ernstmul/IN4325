Times News Service clients)  \n By MARK SHAFFER  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   AGUA PRIETA, Sonora _ It was last month that Mayor Vicente Teran\nreally realized how much this dusty border city has become what he\ncalls ``Mexico's Kosovo.''\n\n   He and others in this, the border's most popular crossing point\nfor illegal immigrants, already had watched the number of strangers\nwandering daily around downtown grow to 3,000.\n\n   They'd seen the new, low-end hotels springing up, lured by a\ndemand so lucrative that even three doctors turned their offices\ninto lodging for people heading north.\n\n   They'd heard of the 100 immigrant-smuggling organizations\nsupposedly operating within a 10-minute walk of the border\ncheckpoint to neighboring Douglas, Ariz.\n\n   But what really drove home the point, Teran said, was the\n``waiting line to get in the cemetery'' during one week last month\nwhen 27 people met a violent end.\n\n   ``Coyotes'' _ immigrant smugglers _ were killing other coyotes\nin the turf war over human bounty, he said. Border bandits were\nkilling helpless immigrants for their meager possessions. A\nprisoner from another part of Mexico slipped his restraints and\nmurdered two local police officers.\n\n   ``We've got a giant mafia controlling this city,'' said Paula\nLopez Martinez, who operates a jewelry store on bustling Fourth\nAvenue downtown.\n\n   ``But it's not the drug smugglers like in the past. It's the\npeople smugglers.''\n\n   Five years ago, a half-dozen hotels served this city of 120,000.\nAgua Prieta, located in arid, isolated northeastern Sonora, had\nnever been on anyone's map of likely destinations.\n\n   But all that changed when U.S. immigration officials started\nclamping down on traditional immigrant-smuggling routes _ first El\nPaso, then San Diego and later, Nogales.\n\n   Today, Agua Prieta boasts 16 hotels and more than 500 rooms. At\nleast, that's the official version of the hospitality industry.\n\n   In reality, dozens of other smaller hotels also have opened in\nthe city, many in abandoned storefronts. Many homeowners have\nconverted vacant rooms and sheds into lodging.\n\n   Eight blocks from the border, a developer is nearing completion\nof a large multilevel dormitory with cafeteria.\n\n   The Roman Catholic Church also is getting in on the act,\nbuilding a shelter for 50 people with beds and eating facilities\nabout two miles from the border.\n\n     Human smuggling is against the law in Mexico, and several\n`coyotes' have been arrested in Agua Prieta. Still, local\nentrepreneurs say they aren't going to turn their back on such\ninviting money-making opportunities.\n\n   The demand is so great that smugglers stuff as many as 20 people\nin one hotel room; some hotels rent out space on hall floors for\nimmigrants to sleep on.\n\n   Douglas Mayor Ray Borane, who's lobbying the U.S. government to\ndo something about the relentless waves of immigrants, said he has\nmet resistance from Agua Prieta businessmen.\n\n   ``They keep saying, `Hey, stay out of this. Business has never\nbeen better and we want to keep it that way,' '' Borane said.\n\n   But some Agua Prieta businessmen, like hardware-store owner\nDavid de la Torre, said the problem of the ``floating refugees'' is\nruining legitimate businesses and respectable townspeople.\n\n   ``It's a serious problem when you have 3,000 people just hanging\naround your downtown area, and buses full of more of them coming\nhere every day,'' de la Torre said.\n\n   ``My mom has had to close her curio shop because of the\nincreased violence and the fact that tourists just don't come here\nany more.''\n\n   Efrain Martinez, who hosts an Agua Prieta radio talk show, put\nthe problem this way: fewer gringos with money and more Mexicans\nfrom the interior without it.\n\n   ``They also are angry about all the crime, how you can't find a\ntaxi any more because they are all moving immigrants around to\ncross the border,'' Martinez said, ``and how the used-car lots\ndon't seem to have anything but vans for sale.\n\n   Many of the people on the streets have been caught numerous\ntimes by U.S. Border Patrol agents and are left penniless in the\nMexican city.\n\n   In the past year, more than 20,000 Mexicans a month have been\nreturned to their country at Agua Prieta. The Border Patrol drew\nthe ire of city leaders in February when it was learned that, in\naddition to those being caught in the Douglas area, immigrants\ncaught in the Nogales area also were pushed back south at Agua\nPrieta.\n\n   But the Border Patrol, in an attempt to disrupt smuggling\noperations, then started deporting people caught in the Nogales\narea in Agua Prieta and those in the Douglas area in Nogales.\n\n   Teran, the Agua Prieta mayor, said the immigrants have taxed his\ncity's services to the max. Many of those who have been repeatedly\ncaptured by the Border Patrol have formed neighborhoods of\ncardboard and scrap-wood shacks on the city's far-south side.\n\n   They typically live hand-to-mouth or pick up the worst jobs that\nthe city's maquila industries have to offer, Teran said.\n\n   '`In the past five years, our population has doubled to 120,000,\nand this is where a large part of that growth has come from,`'\nTeran said.\n\n   Teran said city officials talked one bus company into offering\nhalf-price fares to take those people back home who wanted to go,\nbut he didn't know how successful the special fare had been.\n\n   Lopez, the jewelry-store owner, gets a big chuckle out of that\none.\n\n   She said she recently took a bus trip to her native state of\nGuanajuato on a virtually empty bus. On the way north, however, she\ncould find only one seat.\n\n   ``It was full of people from southern Mexico and Guatemala with\na `coyote' who controlled the movements of the bus,'' Lopez said.\n\n   ``The driver stopped whenever the `coyote' wanted him to, and we\nstayed a lot of time at the checkpoints wherever there were federal\npolice because he was paying bribes to all of them.''\n\n   Lopez glanced down the street to the half block of buildings she\nbought with her husband three years ago, when they were empty. Now\nthey house her jewelry store, a flourishing law practice and a\nrestaurant kept busy by lines of immigrants.\n\n   She smiled.\n\n   ``I think we bought at the right time,'' she said.   \nMark Shaffer can be reached at (602) 444-8057 or at\nmark.shaffer(at)pni.com via e-mail.  \n","Headline":"\n`MEXICO'S KOSOVO': THOUSANDS IN TRANSIT TO U.S. SWAMP BORDER CITY \n","Text":["\n   AGUA PRIETA, Sonora _ It was last month that Mayor Vicente Teran\nreally realized how much this dusty border city has become what he\ncalls ``Mexico's Kosovo.''\n","\n   He and others in this, the border's most popular crossing point\nfor illegal immigrants, already had watched the number of strangers\nwandering daily around downtown grow to 3,000.\n","\n   They'd seen the new, low-end hotels springing up, lured by a\ndemand so lucrative that even three doctors turned their offices\ninto lodging for people heading north.\n","\n   They'd heard of the 100 immigrant-smuggling organizations\nsupposedly operating within a 10-minute walk of the border\ncheckpoint to neighboring Douglas, Ariz.\n","\n   But what really drove home the point, Teran said, was the\n``waiting line to get in the cemetery'' during one week last month\nwhen 27 people met a violent end.\n","\n   ``Coyotes'' _ immigrant smugglers _ were killing other coyotes\nin the turf war over human bounty, he said.
