But\nif the report proves to be accurate, it would be a huge new\nheadache for a province swamped by both a rising tide of illegal\nmigrants and waves of anger over immigration policies.\n\n   Three boats carrying more than 440 people have been spotted and\nseized since mid-July. A fourth vessel, dubbed ``the ghost ship''\nby Caplan, is believed to have dropped off its human cargo in the\nQueen Charlotte Islands in early July before sinking.\n\n   A total of 378 migrants, almost all from Fujian province, are\nbeing held in Esquimalt and Vancouver, pending processing of\nrefugee applications by some of the Chinese and possible criminal\nprosecution of those involved in the smuggling operations.\n\n   Sixty-eight people aboard the first boat, apprehended on July\n20, were released from custody after filing applications for\nrefugee status.\n\n   Immigration Canada is investigating reports that as many as 30\nof them have disappeared, and that some may have ended up in New\nYork. The agency hopes to have information available Friday, said\nRob Johnson, chief of the Enforcement Office.\n\n   Caplan said Thursday that smugglers with links to organized\ncrime ``mock our laws'' and endanger lives by `luring people onto\ndecrepit boats'' for the trans-Pacific voyage. The ultimate\ndestination of most migrants is believed to be New York, and an\nillegal economy where they must work off a price of passage that\naverages around $38,000.\n\n   At a meeting earlier this week at the Asia Pacific Economic\nCooperation summit in New Zealand, Canada's foreign minister Lloyd\nAxworthy sought help from China in combatting what Caplan called\n``the trafficking in human beings.''\n\n   With thousands of miles of fjords, inlets and islands to patrol,\nCanada also has turned to the United States for help in detecting\nadditional unmarked ships with human cargoes.\n\n   ``The answer is that international partners are working together\nand that includes the United States,'' Caplan said Thursday. With\nstepped up surveillance, she said Canada hopes to send smugglers a\nmessage:\n\n   ``You are not going to succeed. We will catch you.''\n\n   In the meantime, Canada's federal government is catching it from\nall sides over costs of caring for the illegal migrants, and the\nperceived leniency of immigration laws. Those who apply for refugee\nstatus upon arrival in Canada, an estimated 25,000 people a year,\nare allowed to remain in the country while their cases are heard.\n\n   The process takes an average of 11 months.\n\n   ``We have to change our laws so those who are not genuine\nmigrants can be sent home immediately,'' said Gary Lunn, a member\nof parliament from the conservative opposition Reform Party.\n\n   Lunn has collected 4,000 signatures on a petition demanding the\ntoughening of Canada's immigration laws.\n\n   A fellow Reform lawmaker, John Reyolds, added: ``In 25 years in\npolitics, I've never seen an issue that made people so mad.''\n\n   The British Columbia government has ended up footing much of the\nbill for taking care of the illegal migrants. The cost for group\nhome services, translators and English language lessors amounts to\nas much as $8,200 a month (Canadian) for each of 70 children taken\nfrom the boats. The cost for each adult being held runs to $8,600,\nsaid B.C. Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjh.\n\n   ``It becomes a couple million dollars a month for our\ntreasury,'' said Dosanjh, who met with Caplan Thursday night and\nasked for financial help.\n\n   The 378 Chinese migrants currently being held are likely to stay\nin detention, along with those from any other boats off Canada's\nshores. Stung by the disappearance of people from the first boat,\nImmigration Canada has tightened procedures. It is holding migrants\nwho are undocumented and deemed ``uncooperative,'' as well as those\nwho may be at risk from smuggling rings.\n\n   On the job just five weeks, Caplan on Thursday promised to do\neverything she can to speed up processing of the Fujian Chinese.\n\n   ``If there are legitimate refugees among them, they will be\nallowed to stay in Canada,'' she said.\n\n   ``The rest we will seek to remove as quickly as possible.'' She\nsaid most of the boat people, who tend to be poor and not well\neducated, ``would never qualify as immigrants who meet our test.''\n\n   ``If we need to toughen our laws, we will,'' Caplan added during\na Canadian Club luncheon appearance.\n\n   Asked about reports of 11 more boatloads, and whether Canada\nwould turn back boats filled with refugees, she replied: ``I want\nto be clear. I would never put human life at risk.''\n\n   Debate over whether to send home the Chinese illegals has struck\ndeep at this country's national identity.\n\n   The latest ship is being shadowed by a Canadian navy frigate,\nHMS Huron, off the coast of Vancouver Island.\n\n   ``The information we have is that the ship has not yet entered\nCanadian waters,'' Caplan said. ``We think it will.''\n\n   Lt. Chris Henderson, a Canadian navy spokesman, refused to\ndisclose details of where the ship is located, other than that it\nis unmarked. ``We have no reason to suspect that this ship knows it\nis under surveillance,'' he added.\n\n   Caplan noted Thursday that human smuggling has become an\ninternational business.
