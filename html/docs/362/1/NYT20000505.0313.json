Immigration agents\nopened them to find 63 men who endured squalor and sea sickness\nonly to fail.\n\n   The worst moment came Jan. 10 at Harbor Island. Acting on a tip,\nimmigration agents waited for a container from the NYC Cape May at\nTerminal 18. Three of the 18 men inside were dead. Thirst and\nstarvation brought on by unending sea sickness took their lives.\n\n   Zhang Hui, a few days short of his 26th birthday, died first on\nNew Year's Day. He left a father and brother in China.\n\n   Jiang, 35, died Jan. 7. Besides Chen, he left a daughter, Nana,\n8, and a son, Jiazhi, 3, in Fujian.\n\n   Zhu Benqing, 30, died two days later. He had a wife, Jiang\nSaimci, and a 2-year-old daughter, Shiyao.\n\n   Entombed in the hold of the ship, fellow stowaways pounded on\nthe sides of the container for help as the men died, said Alan Lai,\na counselor with the Chinese Information and Service Center in\nSeattle. No help came.\n\n   ``They didn't want to see people die,'' said Lai, who has talked\nto the families of the dead men to try to offer help.\n\n   One more container filled with stowaways arrived in Seattle\nafter the Cape May, then the human smuggling to the Northwest ended\n_ temporarily, immigration officials say.\n\n   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has detained the 60\nstowaways who arrived in January. The U.S. Attorney's Office in\nSeattle has been investigating the deaths.\n\n   There is mostly waiting at the Medical Examiner's Office and in\nChina.\n\n   ``It's a tangled, bureaucratic political situation,'' said Jerry\nWebster, chief investigator at the Medical Examiner's Office.\n\n   Until he hears from the families, the bodies will remain where\nthey are. ``If this goes on another year, those folks still will be\nwith me,'' Webster said.\n\n   In China, three families want to come to Seattle to see their\nloved ones. They fear that if the bodies are shipped home, the\nChinese government will dispose of them, allowing relatives neither\nthe opportunity to see them nor to perform final rites.\n\n   Lai's social service organization has offered to help, as has\nU.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\n\n   But the State Department hasn't been encouraging about issuing\ntourist visas to the relatives of illegal immigrants.\n\n   ``While their applications will receive every consideration\nconsistent with U.S. visa law and regulations, they should realize\ntheir situation arises because of their relatives' attempt to enter\nillegally the United States,'' Edward McKeon, U.S. counsul general\nin Guangzhou, in Canton province, wrote in a telegram to Murray.\n``This indicates the deceased did not believe themselves eligible\nfor United States visas.''\n\n   The visas, Lai said, are the key. After that, money probably can\nbe raised in the Chinese community in Seattle to bring family\nmembers here.\n\n   Chen has been trying to arrange a visa interview in Guangzhou.\n\n   ``Yesterday I called five or six times, but they wouldn't help\nme. They put the phone down and wouldn't even listen to me,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   ``Please help. I called five or six times, and they wouldn't\ntalk to me. I beg you to please help.''\n\n   Life was never easy for Chen and Jiang. The government forced\nhim to have a vasectomy after the couple violated China's one-child\npolicy, she said.\n\n   The couple scraped together $1,000 as a downpayment to the\nsnakeheads, as smugglers are called, to get to America and earned\nneeded money for his family. He left Fujian as 1999 ended.\n\n   Now Chen said she lives ``one day at a time.''\n\n   Poverty has forced her and her children to move in with in-laws.\n``There is no work,'' she said. ``I want to work, but there is\nnothing.''\n\n   As she waits, Chen must face her son and daughter. For now, she\nhas kept the truth from them.\n\n   ``They call, `Daddy! Daddy!' But I had to lie to them. I told\nthem their Dad left for a faraway place to make money.''\n","Headline":"\nA WIDOW'S WISH FRUSTRATED BY POVERTY, TWO NATIONS' BUREAUCRACIES \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Chen Shaolin has a simple wish: She wants to see her\nhusband.\n","\n   An ocean stands between the Chinese woman and Jiang Dainbiao,\ndead since January.
