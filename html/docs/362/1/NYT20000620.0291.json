Times News Service   \n\n   LONDON _ British police officers investigating the deaths of 58\nChinese immigrants found crammed into the freight container of a\ntruck in Dover ordered the Dutch driver held on suspicion of\nmanslaughter Tuesday and began interviewing two men in a Canterbury\nhospital who lived through the ordeal.\n\n   ``The two men are of enormous value to us simply because they\nare the only survivors,'' said Detective Superintendent Dennis\nMcGookin, the head of the investigation. ``This is being treated as\na homicide; it is a major criminal investigation.''\n\n   The case has focused attention on the lucrative international\nbusiness of smuggling desperate refugees who the British police say\nwill pay crime syndicates up to $30,000 each to be brought here.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, in Portugal at a European meeting, said\nthe case had prompted a ``huge willingness'' on the part of\ncontinental leaders to ``tackle this problem of trade in human\nmisery.''\n\n   The Dutch police said they had arrested a man in Rotterdam in\nconnection with the grisly early Monday discovery in the English\nchannel port, but they gave no details. The 50-foot transport was\nregistered to a Rotterdam company that had been set up just five\ndays earlier, and the police were searching for Arie van der Spek,\n24, an engineer who lived at the address listed for the company.\n\n   McGookin, the investigator, said initial forensic findings\nshowed the 54 men and 4 women died of ``some form of respiratory\nfailure.'' The truck's refrigeration system had been turned off,\nturning the space packed with the migrants and stacked high with\ntomato crates into an airless oven.\n\n   Without identifying their sources, British newspapers reported\nthat the two survivors said they were clawing at the inside of the\nsealed back door and screaming at the driver. The moment that\ncustoms officers opened the doors, they reportedly said, was ``as\nif an angel had been sent from heaven.''\n\n   Officers pulled the vehicle over shortly after midnight Sunday\nas it left the ferry, which had made the four-and-a-half-hour\ncrossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Belgian authorities alerted\nBritish customs officials about their suspicions when they could\nfind no prior record of the company listed in the registry and when\nthey saw the driver pay for the journey in cash.\n\n   McGookin said the victims were all in their 20s and came from\nFujian province in southern China. ``These people have died a\nhorrific death, and somewhere in China, but also maybe in this\ncountry, are their relatives,'' he said. ``We would appeal to\nanyone that knows the deceased to come forward at once''\n\n   Many of the estimated 150,000 Chinese living in Britain come\nfrom Fujian, but authorities worry that they will not come forward\nfor fear of exposing themselves to arrest and deportation as\nillegal residents. The police set up a public emergency phone\nnumber staffed by Chinese speakers.\n\n   McGookin said he was receiving cooperation from the Chinese\nEmbassy and government to identify victims and track down the gang\nleaders who managed to ferry the refugees such a distance. ``To\nhave 60 young people in the back of a truck, there would have to\nhave taken some organization to get these people over from China,''\nhe said. ``In liaising with the Chinese police, hopefully we will\nknow more on this soon.''\n\n   A Home Office spokesman said that since spring about 600\nimmigrants have been detained in Dover each month, down from 2,000\na month from January to March.\n\n   The spokesman credited laws put into effect in April for the\nreduction. Since then truck drivers have been liable to fines of\n$3,000 for every stowaway found on their rigs.\n\n   Blair said, ``This tragedy has brought home to people the sheer\nscale of this problem, and it doesn't just affect Britain, it\naffects every other country.''\n","Headline":"\nDRIVER HELD, SURVIVORS QUESTIONED IN DEATHS OF 58 CHINESE\nIMMIGRANTS \n","Text":["\n   LONDON _ British police officers investigating the deaths of 58\nChinese immigrants found crammed into the freight container of a\ntruck in Dover ordered the Dutch driver held on suspicion of\nmanslaughter Tuesday and began interviewing two men in a Canterbury\nhospital who lived through the ordeal.\n","\n   ``The two men are of enormous value to us simply because they\nare the only survivors,'' said Detective Superintendent Dennis\nMcGookin, the head of the investigation. ``This is being treated as\na homicide; it is a major criminal investigation.''\n","\n   The case has focused attention on the lucrative international\nbusiness of smuggling desperate refugees who the British police say\nwill pay crime syndicates up to $30,000 each to be brought here.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, in Portugal at a European meeting, said\nthe case had prompted a ``huge willingness'' on the part of\ncontinental leaders to ``tackle this problem of trade in human\nmisery.''\n","\n   The Dutch police said they had arrested a man in Rotterdam in\nconnection with the grisly early Monday discovery in the English\nchannel port, but they gave no details.
