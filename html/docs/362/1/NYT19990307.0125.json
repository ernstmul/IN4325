Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI _ The three Haitian men who rescuers found in cold, rough\nseas are apparently the only survivors of two boats that sank this\nweekend off the South Florida coast, leaving as many as 40 dead in\nwhat may be the worst smuggling disaster in this state's history.\n\n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which had found only the three survivors\nand four bodies in its sweep of the open ocean from Cape Canaveral\nto Palm Beach, called off its search Sunday as hope faded of\nfinding anyone still alive.\n\n   ``Forty are presumed dead,'' said Art Bullock, a U.S. Border\nPatrol officer in West Palm Beach.\n\n   The two boats, with most of their human cargo, vanished about 30\nmiles east of Palm Beach.\n\n   ``We have found no debris, no vessels,'' Jeff Hall, petty\nofficer with the Coast Guard in Miami. Even if survivors had\nsomething to cling onto, it was unlikely they could have survived,\nHall said.\n\n   ``The water temperature was 70 to 72 degrees,'' he said. ``We\nfactored in the water temperature to gauge their chances of\nsurvival.''\n\n   In a state that has seen bodies and makeshift rafts wash up on\nits beaches for as long as most people here can remember, this sea\ndisaster is almost certainly the most costly, in lives, in the\nseemingly never-ending crossings from Haiti and Cuba, rescuers\nsaid.\n\n   ``It's the biggest disappearance of a boatload of refugees that\nI've heard of,'' in Florida waters, Hall said.\n\n   The Haitians, trying to escape the latest rounds of violence and\npersecution and a endless poverty, were apparently making their\ncrossing with the help of a for-profit smuggling ring,\nlaw-enforcement officials said, after speaking with the three\nsurvivors.\n\n   The two vessels, a 17-foot boat and a 20-foot boat, were\nbelieved to have cast off from the western end of Grand Bahama, and\nheaded straight for Palm Beach, a usual smuggling route, Hall said.\n\n   Usually, such boats carry about nine people at most, Hall said.\nThese boats had at least twice that, he said.\n\n   Early Saturday morning, sometime just after midnight, one of the\nboats began to sink, and the second boat came alongside to help.\nBut as the terrified passengers crossed over on the second boat,\nit, too, began to sink, one of the survivors told rescuers.\n\n   At about 2 a.m. Saturday, about 30 miles off Palm Beach, crewmen\naboard the passing freighter Tomas Faith heard screams in the\nwater, and radioed the Coast Guard. The sinking might have gone\nunreported, if crewmen aboard the Tomas Faith had not heard people\nscreaming. As it turned out, only a few people, dead or alive, were\nfound on the surface as dawn broke.\n\n   A helicopter found the first survivor, weakly trying to stay\nafloat as he grasped a propane tank, at about at about 5 a.m., and\ntwo others were found clinging to a barrel at about 8 a.m. All\nthree survivors, one man in his late 30s, one in his early 40s and\nanother in his 20s, were treated for hypothermia, and questioned by\nthe Border Patrol.\n\n   Although rescuers used helicopters, planes and seagoing boats to\nsearch an area of 2,600 square miles, they found only four bodies.\n\n   They found no life jackets, either on the survivors, on the\nbodies, or floating on the water.\n\n   ``In the Bahamas, smugglers tell them it's easy to get here,''\nsaid Samedi Florvil, who works with the Haitian Refugee Center in\nMiami.\n\n   But then, Haitians here in Miami said, those who can afford the\ncosts _some pay hundreds of dollars, or more, a small fortune in\nthat poor country _ are loaded onto unsafe boats, and risk their\nlives in crossings in the dead of night.\n\n   It is happening, immigration officials said, more and more, in\nboth Haiti and Cuba.\n\n   The sinking of the two vessels on Saturday follows a December\nincident, in which a larger vessel sank in high seas just off\nElliott Key, about 20 miles south of Miami.\n\n   Investigators believe that 14 Cubans perished, although only\nnine bodies were recovered and the rest are believed to have been\nlost at sea.\n\n   Two of the nine survivors were charged with smuggling.\n\n   As conditions in those Haiti and Cuba worsen, the number of\nrafters and smuggled people is expected to rise. In 1998, the Coast\nGuard intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians as they tried to\nenter the country, said Petty Officer Hall.
