It's becoming a booming\nbusiness as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers\nequipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances\nof reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40\nHaitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last\nweekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of\nputting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector\nhas less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency\nhasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that\nperiod, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,\ndoubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.\nUnfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of\nagents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,\nCalifornia, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector\nhas 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;\nTucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2\nmillion; San Diego is $178 million.

He says he's the often the only Border Patrol agent working\nfrom Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent night, he\nrounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This\neffectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti\nwill spend the rest of the night processing these refugees.

A couple reasons. The\nsmugglees make lousy witnesses. There's also the built-in defense:\n``I'm not a smuggler. I was fishing and rescued these Cubans from\ntheir sinking raft.'' Prosecutors also have felt that juries of\nCuban exiles and other immigrants find it hard to convict someone\nof helping their fellow countrymen escape oppression. Furthermore,\nthe courts haven't been very tough on convicted smugglers, even if\nthe case involves the deaths of refugees. For example: In South\nFla, the USAtty prosecuted 62 percent of cases referred by the\nBorder Patrol; in Arizona, 92 percent; in Southern California, 99\npercent; in South Texas, 99 percent.
