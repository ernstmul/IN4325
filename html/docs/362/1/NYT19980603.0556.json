DUGGER   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Wang Wu Dong was a skinny man of 40 when he washed up on the\nshores of Queens, New York, five years ago, a passenger on the\nGolden Venture, a freighter loaded with a human cargo of 286\nillegal Chinese immigrants that shuddered to a halt on a sandbar\nwithin sight of New York City's lights.\n\n   He was apprehended that night and spent the next three years\nbehind bars, trying unsuccessfully to win asylum on the ground he\nhad been persecuted for resisting China's one-child policy. He\nfinally gave up and went home, just months before Congress passed a\nlaw in 1996 that would have made his asylum claim more likely to\nsucceed.\n\n   Wang's timing was miserably off once again last Saturday. He was\namong the 23 illegal Chinese immigrants aboard the Oops II, a\n30-foot powerboat named with a cruelly flippant aptness. It ran\naground in dense fog off the New Jersey shore, leaving the men to\nscatter in the darkened streets of the wealthy seaside area where\nthey were picked up by police.\n\n   Lawyers, advocates, officials and a fellow Golden Venture\npassenger interviewed Wednesday remarked on Wang's ill fortune,\nwhich was first reported Wednesday in The Star-Ledger of Newark,\nN.J. But they tipped their hats to his determination to get to\nAmerica.\n\n   ``To me, it's unbelievable he went through all of that, then\nturned around to come back again,'' said Beverly Church, a\nparalegal who became a mother hen to many of the Golden Venture\npassengers during their three-year detention in York, Pa. ``It\ntells me how much he'll go through to be free.''\n\n   Wang's lawyers said he would definitely apply for asylum again,\nciting what he says was his wife's forced sterilization. ``The law\nhas changed significantly and I think he has a good case,'' said\nRobert Porges, the Chinatown lawyer whose firm is representing 20\nof the 23 detainees.\n\n   Porges said all his clients would ask for asylum, some on the\nbasis of China's one-child policy and some contending they were\npersecuted because they are Christians.\n\n   Hearings for Wang and the other 22 men apprehended after the\nOops II grounded off Bay Head, N.J., will begin Thursday in\nElizabeth, N.J., where the immigrants are being detained in the\ncustody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n   Immigration officials said all the men from the Oops II would be\ncharged with entering the country illegally. The Lawyers Committee\nfor Human Rights gave a briefing to the detainees at the Elizabeth\ncenter on Wednesday, explaining the process to them. Immigration\nofficials said that at the first hearing, a judge would inform the\nChinese of the charges against them. Hearings on the merit of their\ncases will probably be held within six months.\n\n   The authorities are still searching for Jason Choi, 38, the\ncaptain of the Oops II. Choi is a Korean who was questioned and\nreleased the night the boat ran aground but before the Bay Head\npolice realized it had been carrying illegal immigrants. Choi's\nformer roommate at an apartment at 147-15 Northern Boulevard, in\nFlushing, Queens, told The Korea Times newspaper that Choi last\nlived in the apartment from February until late April and said he\nhad come from Korea about one year ago.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The men who were passengers on Choi's boat, however, were\nsettling into detention Wednesday night. Wang, who identified\nhimself to his lawyers as one of the Golden Venture passengers,\nconferred with them about how best to fight deportation to China.\n\n   Russell Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the immigration service in\nWashington, said he could not confirm whether there was a Golden\nVenture passenger on board the Oops II because of federal privacy\nlaws.\n\n   Immigration officials said that each man on the Oops II may have\npaid the smugglers as much as $40,000 for the journey to New York.\nThe men, from 18 to 45 years old, came from Fujian Province, home\nto many of New York City's illegal Chinese immigrants.\n\n   When Wang first arrived in the United States five years ago, he\nhad little chance of winning asylum on the ground that he had been\npersecuted under China's population control policies.\n\n   Had he come a year earlier, when Bush administration policies\nwere in effect, he would have had a chance. But during the Clinton\nyears, immigration judges routinely ruled that China was not\npersecuting the immigrants, but enforcing a national policy\ndesigned to fight overpopulation.\n\n   Wang spent three years behind bars in York, Pa., in the custody\nof immigration authorities. Like many of the other men, he began\npassing the tedious hours by using toilet paper, water and glue to\nhelp make papier-mache creations like eagles, dragons and Statues\nof Liberty. But as months and years passed, he became discouraged,\nsay people who knew him then.\n\n   Ms. Church, who regularly visited the York County prison where\nWang was being held, said he worried about his family in China,\nespecially since he was unable to work and send money home. ``He\nwas of no value to anyone in prison,'' she said.\n\n   His asylum petition had been denied. And the legal battle being\nwaged in federal court to win new hearings for the Golden Venture\ndetainees seemed to drag on endlessly. The immigrants' legal\nadvocates maintained that the men had been unfairly denied refuge\nin the United States because the government was using them to send\na message to smugglers.\n\n   Finally, in February 1996, Wang gave up. He asked to be sent\nback to China.\n\n   ``Too much depression,'' said Steven Shi, 27, a Golden Venture\npassenger who won an artist's visa last month that allows him to\nremain in the United States. ``Depression made him go back.''\n\n   In September 1996, Congress passed a new law backed by\nanti-abortion Republicans that made opposing China's one-child\npolicy a potential reason for a grant of asylum.\n\n   It is that law that gives Wang's lawyers hope that his luck has\nfinally changed. Already Wednesday, Wang was gaining some\npotentially important political allies, including some of the\nmembers of Congress who worked to change the law and lobbied on\nbehalf of the Golden Venture detainees.\n\n   ``It's obvious that because of the practice of forced\nsterilization and human rights violations, these people will do\nanything to escape,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa. ``That he\nwould risk being reimprisoned so soon after he went back shows you\nhow unbearable the situation is.''\n","Headline":"\nCHINESE MAN WAS MAKING 2ND BID TO ENTER U.S. ILLEGALLY \n","Text":["\n   Wang Wu Dong was a skinny man of 40 when he washed up on the\nshores of Queens, New York, five years ago, a passenger on the\nGolden Venture, a freighter loaded with a human cargo of 286\nillegal Chinese immigrants that shuddered to a halt on a sandbar\nwithin sight of New York City's lights.\n","\n   He was apprehended that night and spent the next three years\nbehind bars, trying unsuccessfully to win asylum on the ground he\nhad been persecuted for resisting China's one-child policy.
