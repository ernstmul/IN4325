(mk) \n By BARBARA WHITAKER   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   LOS ANGELES _ Federal officials were investigating Monday what\nwas seen as a disturbing trend in smuggling illegal immigrants\nafter the discovery Sunday of 30 stowaways in containers on cargo\nships in Long Beach, Calif., and Seattle.\n\n   The discoveries were made less than a week after two other\ngroups of illegal Chinese immigrants were found in similar\ncontainers on cargo ships in the Los Angeles area.\n\n   In addition, according to court documents in Seattle, two more\ncontainers with Chinese nationals were expected to arrive there on\nTuesday.\n\n   ``This is a relatively new and troubling trend,'' said Virginia\nC. Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization\nService.\n\n   In the recent cases, soft-top containers about the size of a\ntractor-trailer were used to carry Chinese stowaways who paid as\nmuch as $70,000, more than twice the amount charged by people\noperating ships devoted primarily to smuggling, Ms. Kice said.\n\n   A cargo ship can carry as many as 1,000 of these containers,\nwhich can make it difficult to detect stowaways. The smugglers\noften lash down the heavy canvas covers on the containers using\nther grommet to make escape easier and provide ventilation.\n\n   Ms. Kice said identifying the organizers of the\ncontainer-smuggling operations is more difficult because the\nstowaways are not necessarily accompanied, as they were on previous\nsmuggling ships.\n\n   In the Seattle case, though, the authorities have charged three\nmen who apparently went to meet the containers with attempting to\nbring illegal aliens into the United States.\n\n   The exporter of all three of the containers sent to Seattle and\ntwo of the containers that arrived in Los Angeles last week was\nidentified in court papers as Lap Kei Trading Co. of Hong Kong.\n\n   Ms. Kice said that while there was ence that the ship\nowners were involved, federal officials were looking into making\nshipping companies more responsible for stowaways by holding them\nliable for some of the costs of detention.\n\n   Overall, Ms. Kice said, the conditions in the containers were\nbetter than those of the old smuggling ships that carried more\npeople and took longer to make the journey across the Pacific.\nTypically, a smuggling ship would carry about 200 people, she said,\nbut the containers usually carry fewer than 25.\n\n   Officials who have seen both types of smuggling said the\ncontainers tend to be more sanitary, with makeshift latrines and\nbetter provisions, such as bedding and pillows. The detainees in\nthe recent cases were also better dressed, wearing clothing like\nNike tennis shoes. Some had portable phones and compact disc\nplayers.\n\n   But, Ms. Kice said, it was unknown whether that meant that the\npassengers were more well-to-do or that they had been provided with\nitems like proper clothing to blend in better on the street.\n\n   While conditions might be better, authorities said that people\nwho choose such transportation still face a daunting journey. The\ntrailers can be stacked up to 10 high, which is like crossing the\nocean in a tractor-trailer 10 stories up.\n\n   Federal officials have had a working group of agencies examining\ncontainer smuggling since early last year. The first such case\nknown to officials occurred in April 1998, when a Liberian-flagged\nvessel arrived in Tacoma, Wash., with 18 to 20 stowaways from\nChina. Since then there have been eight cases, including four this\npast week.\n\n   While federal authorities said they would increase enforcement\nefforts to combat container smuggling, Ms. Kice said the smugglers'\nchange in approach was an indication that other enforcement efforts\nhad been effective.\n\n   In the early 1990s, authorities were faced with a spate of\nsmuggling of illegal immigrants on ships. One of the most notable\nwas the Golden Venture, which ran aground in June 1993 on a sandbar\nnear Far Rockaway, N.y. Ten passengers died after jumping into the\nsea.\n\n   ``Chinese smuggling has been on our radar screen for years,''\nMs. Kice said. ``This is the smuggler adjusting their strategy.''\n\n   On Dec. 29, the authorities detained 21 people at the Port of\nLong Beach and nine at Los Angeles Harbor as they emerged from\nhiding in cargo containers.\n\n   On Sunday, 18 stowaways were found by crew members inside a\ncargo container on the Zim Shekou as it was coming into the Port of\nLong Beach. The ship had apparently left Hong Kong about three\nweeks ago and had a stopover in British Columbia.\n\n   In Seattle, 12 men were found aboard the ship OOCL Faith, which\nis owned by Orient Overseas Container Line of Hong Kong.\n\n   Officials said all those detained in the last week remained in\ncustody and were being interviewed. The process is complicated\nbecause there are so many different dialects that it can be\ndifficult to find interpreters.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. INVESTIGATES NEW TREND IN IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING \n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Federal officials were investigating Monday what\nwas seen as a disturbing trend in smuggling illegal immigrants\nafter the discovery Sunday of 30 stowaways in containers on cargo\nships in Long Beach, Calif., and Seattle.\n","\n   The discoveries were made less than a week after two other\ngroups of illegal Chinese immigrants were found in similar\ncontainers on cargo ships in the Los Angeles area.\n","\n   In addition, according to court documents in Seattle, two more\ncontainers with Chinese nationals were expected to arrive there on\nTuesday.\n","\n   ``This is a relatively new and troubling trend,'' said Virginia\nC.
