When he\narrived, Wilner Casseus told him there was only one boat with 18\npeople on board.\n\n   Wilner gave authorities a fake name because he was scared of\nbeing deported or charged with something, his brother said: ``If he\ntell a lot of lies, it's because he's so scared. He don't know what\nto do so he make up a lot of lies.'' Chavannes Casseus called\nDaniella Henry, director of the Haitian American Community Council,\non Tuesday after she went on the air on WHSR. Henry had held a\nlively discussion on Radio Haiti-Amerique Internacional with\ncallers.\n\n   Chavannes Casseus said his brother is from l'Artibonite, a\ngrain-producing district in central Haiti hit hard last year by\nHurricane Mitch. Henry said the other two survivors, Pierre-Louis\nand Auguste, are also from l'Artibonite.
