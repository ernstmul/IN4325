Times News Service   \n\n   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Agent Griselda Vidrio had just wandered\ninto the U.S. Border Patrol's processing center after several hours\npatroling the weed-girded Rio Grande when she caught sight of the\nyoung Honduran couple and the seven-month-old baby in their arms.\n\n   ``You know how it is with a baby, you see one and you go up to\nthem,'' Ms. Vidrio, a border agent, said. ``The baby looked at me\nand smiled and something struck me. I knew that baby. I had held it\nin my arms. I thought, no, this baby has already been here.''\n\n   Ms. Vidrio's memory flash on March 31 led to uncovering a\nsmuggling network that, U.S. officials said, had been doing\nsomething they had suspected was occurring with increasing\nfrequency along the border _ the use of infants and young children,\nperhaps kidnapped, perhaps rented from impoverished parents, as\nliving props to bamboozle border agents.\n\n   The baby ruse is just the latest wrinkle in the game of\ncat-and-mouse between border agents and illegal-alien smugglers, a\ngame that has only intensified following recent federal crackdowns\nand dramatic rises in the number of agents along the border.\n\n   Smugglers, it seems, have discovered an inadvertent loophole on\nthe U.S. border. If illegal aliens are taken in custody and claim\nto be a family, especially with babies or young children, they are\nsimply cut loose and asked to report for a later court date, as\nthere are no facilities for housing families on the border and\nagents say they do not want to split up families.\n\n   The practice of letting families go began several years ago, but\nhas become more frequent since thousands of Central Americans have\ntried to get into the United States in in the wake of Hurricane\nMitch.\n\n   ``The reality is that most of them don't show up for their court\ndate, but we do it for humanitarian reasons, because we don't have\nthe facilities and it's better than breaking up the family,\nespecially one that's already suffered something like Hurricane\nMitch,'' said Fernando Quiroja, who initially spearheaded the baby\ninvestigation in Brownsville until it was transferred to the\nfederal antismuggling unit in Houston.\n\n   This latest, particularly ugly wrinkle in the struggle between\nsmugglers and border agents picked up steam after a recent U.S.\ncrackdown along the border that has seen agents grow in number in\nsome stations by threefold. In Brownsville, the 18-month-old\nOperation Rio Grande has increased the size of the locally based\nforce to more than 350. When Quiroja first joined the Brownsville\nstation a dozen years ago, there were fewer than 50.\n\n   ``The Border Patrol is without doubt a more formidable presence\naround here,'' said Ivan Welker, Brownsville's assistant city\nmanager. ``Back before Operation Rio Grande, down at the municipal\ngolf course near the border, golfers would routinely see groups of\npeople who had crossed the river coming out of the trees and\ntrotting across the golf course. You'd always be seeing groups of\npeople downtown who looked like maybe they didn't belong in\ndowntown Brownsville. Now, you don't see that. You don't see that\nat all.''\n\n   Already last summer, when South Texas and much of the nation was\ncaught in a vicious drought and heat wave, border agents received\ngruesome evidence of the desperate lengths smugglers were forced to\ngo in the form of the corpses of dozens of aliens who had been led\nacross the border in increasingly remote areas and died from heat\nand lack of water.\n\n   In Brownsville, aliens arrested in the last year have reported\nthat the price of being brought across the border had risen from an\naverage of $300 to $500 a few years ago to an average of $1,400 to\n$1,800 today. And that is for Mexican nationals coming across.\nThose traveling from farther away, like Hurricane Mitch victims,\nmust often pay much more.\n\n   Border agents found themselves investigating g more cases\ninvolving the use of unexpected and expensive modes of\ntransportation, including planes chartered out of Brownsville's\nairport. A new route sprang up to bring illegal aliens up the Gulf\ncoast from Mexico using a network of boats and ferries that\nconnected northern Mexico with Corpus Christi.\n\n   All along the border, from El Paso to the Rio Grande's mouth\nnear Brownsville, border agents have seen smugglers make increasing\nuse of the 18-wheel semis that are moving back and forth across the\nborder by the thousands since passage of the North American Free\nTrade Agreement.\n\n   ``You can't search every semi,'' Quiroja said. ``You'd back up\nthe whole border, and they know that. So they corrupt a few,\nindividual truck drivers.''\n\n   In a recent, very typical case, a truck was found with 101\nillegal aliens hidden in its trailer. ``In cases like that, a\ndriver might make $100 to $500 a head,'' Quiroja said. ``Do the\nmath. That's $10,000 to $50,000, a lot of money. And the smugglers\nare probably keeping $1,000 a head.''\n\n   Ms. Vidrio said she became convinced there was something fishy\nabout the mud-streaked infant when she spotted a turquoise and\nred-bead bracelet on its right wrist, triggering the recent memory\nof another Honduran illegal alien, a man claiming he had been left\nalone with this very same infant when his wife was killed during\nHurricane Mitch. She peppered the young couple with questions. In\nshort order, the scheme unraveled.\n\n   nn\n\n   The woman admitted, border officials said, that she had given\n$1,000 to a smuggler in Matamoros, Mexico, just across from\nBrownsville. The man had paid $1,050. They were both Honduran, but\nhad not known one another before they met at the smuggler's safe\nhouse that day. They were given the baby, which they had never seen\nbefore, and told to swim across the Rio Grande just upstream from\nBrownsville and immediately give themselves up to border agents.\nWhen being processed, they were to tell officials that they were a\nfamily. Once given their court date and released, they were to\ntravel by bus to Houston and call the smuggler's accomplice from\nthe bus station.\n\n   Instead, it was federal agents who called the number from the\nHouston bus station. They arrested two men who arrived in response\nto the call, both of whom were identified by the illegal aliens,\nnow material witnesses in the federal probe, as among the smugglers\nthey had seen in Matamoros. The investigation led to a Houston\napartment where another woman was taken into custody.\n\n   Two days later, the couple who are the apparent real parents of\nthe infant walked into a Houston police station to report their\nchild kidnapped. They were taken into custody, and federal\nofficials suspect that they had actually rented the baby several\ntimes to the smugglers, probably for as little as a few hundred\ndollars.\n\n   A federal grand jury has been hearing the case in Houston and\nwas expected to hand down indictments, perhaps including the\ninfant's mother, as early as next week.\n\n   Immigration officials say they have uncovered at least three\ninstances in which this particular infant was used by smugglers,\nbut suspect it had been used even more often _ just as they suspect\nthat the same ruse, involving other children, is being used with\nincreasing frequency up and down the border, partly in response to\nthe federal crackdown.\n\n   Ms. Vidrio said she was particularly incensed by the callous way\nthe baby was treated. In none of the three known cases, did the\nphony parents carry extra diapers or a change of clothes for the\ninfant, or more than one bottle of infant formula. And they just\nhopped into the Rio Grande and swam across the river with the baby.\n``You can imagine what that baby must have gone through,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   But it is apparently worth it to the smugglers who must find new\nways to circumvent the federal crackdown along the border.\n\n   ``It's a case of when you build a better mousetrap, the mice\nhave to get smarter,'' Quiroja said.\n","Headline":"\nALIEN SMUGGLERS USING NEW TRICKS IN EFFORTS TO EVADE BORDER\nPATROL \n","Text":["\n   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Agent Griselda Vidrio had just wandered\ninto the U.S. Border Patrol's processing center after several hours\npatroling the weed-girded Rio Grande when she caught sight of the\nyoung Honduran couple and the seven-month-old baby in their arms.\n","\n   ``You know how it is with a baby, you see one and you go up to\nthem,'' Ms. Vidrio, a border agent, said. ``The baby looked at me\nand smiled and something struck me.
