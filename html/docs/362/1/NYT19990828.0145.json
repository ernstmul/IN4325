Times News Service   \n\n   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The image of two tramp steamers\ndisgorging 254 undocumented Chinese immigrants on beaches here this\nsummer was enough for a local pharmacist to unleash a tirade about\nCanada's ``lax'' immigration law and ``silly excuses'' for refugee\nstatus, ending with a harsh finale: ``We are being treated like\nsuckers!''\n\n   Around the Pacific Rim, historically European societies have\nlong had a visceral fear of unchecked immigration from China, the\nregion's population behemoth. In the Russian Far East, the police\noften deport Chinese migrants. In Australia, jail terms were\ndoubled last month for the crime of smuggling humans into the\ncountry. This summer, the United States and Canada have stepped up\npatrols in the Western Pacific, seeking to intercept boats filled\nwith clandestine human cargo.\n\n   But what made the Vancouver pharmacist's outburst notable is\nthat the speaker, Derick Y.J. Cheng, is the owner of a Chinatown\ndrugstore, chairman of Vancouver's Chinese Cultural Center and a\nnative of Fujian, the home province of the undocumented immigrants\nwhose arrival this summer caused such furor.\n\n   With ethnic Chinese people accounting for 20 percent of greater\nVancouver's population and Asians accounting for half of this\nfall's freshman class at the University of British Columbia, it is\nhard to accuse this city of anti-Asian intolerance.\n\n   But Cheng's anger, echoed repeatedly this month in letters to\nVancouver's three Chinese daily newspapers and on talk shows on\nlocal Chinese radio and television stations, reflects how attitudes\ntoward immigration are shifting sharply across Canada, a nation\nthat probably has the world's most liberal immigration policies.\n\n   On a per capita basis, Canada receives more immigrants than any\ncountry in the world. As a result, about one in six Canadians is\nforeign born, double the ratio in the United States. Aiming to meet\na target of 225,000 immigrants a year, Canada admits aunts, uncles,\nnieces, nephews, fiances, common law spouses, and same-sex\npartners. On arrival, landed immigrants immediately are entitled to\nthe same menu of health, welfare and university benefits as\nlifelong Canadian citizens.\n\n   But this summer's smuggling boats suddenly exposed a latent fear\namong Canadians that, because of their famous generosity and\ncourteousness, they are becoming a nation of doormats.\n\n   ``Feed our people first,'' read protest signs held as one\nboatload of undocumented Chinese were herded into a navy base near\nVictoria.\n\n   The local newspaper, The Times Colonist, advised the asylum\nseekers: ``Go home. By plane. By boat. Just Go.'' The newspaper\nsaid that 97 percent of 3,362 respondents to its own poll wanted\nthe clandestine migrants to be deported.\n\n   ``This has really gone off the charts,'' said Gary Lunn, a\nmember of Parliament from the area for the conservative Reform\nParty. ``We have had over 1,000 people contacting my office to sign\npetitions. The phones have been jammed for weeks.''\n\n   nn\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   This fall, Lunn said, the Reform Party planned to introduce\nlegislation to tighten Canada's immigration laws. He predicted that\nwhat he termed ``the public outcry'' would be so great that the\ngoverning Liberals would have to vote to restrict immigration.\n\n   It is too pat to dismiss the angry mood as limited to the\nAnglophile retirees of Victoria.\n\n   Two thousand miles to the east, in Toronto, a city that recently\nwon a U.N. award for its racial tolerance, The Globe and Mail, the\ntribune of Canada's liberal establishment, published an editorial\ncondemning loopholes in the immigration law with the headline,\n``The back door's open, come o-o-n in.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The arrival of the two boats, one on July 20 and the other on\nAug. 11, drew into sharp focus a larger, but fuzzier illegal\nimmigration problem. Every year, about 5,000 people flying to\nCanada tear up their documents on airplanes, and then apply for\nrefugee status.\n\n   An increasingly popular practice is to apply for refugee status,\nand then disappear during the one year review period. That abuse\nhas increased 20-fold during the 1990s, reaching 4,203 documented\ncases last year. Among nationalities, Chinese are the worst abusers\nof the system, with 53 percent of claimants vanishing after being\nreleased on refugee status during the first half of this year.\nDuring that time, 95 percent of Chinese claimants in Montreal and\n72 percent of Chinese claimants in Vancouver disappeared. Most are\npresumed to have sneaked or been smuggled across the border to the\nUnited States.\n\n   ``There are 600 under review, only 200 show up, what do you\nthink happened to the 400?''

Critics' favorites include an American woman given refugee\nstatus in Canada because her husband was violent and a convicted\nGuatemalan pedophile allowed to return to Canada after his\ndeportation was ruled illegal.\n\n   But the national press repeatedly returns to undocumented\nChinese as the threat. Saturday's National Post, for example,\nreported a government estimate that two thirds of student visa\napplications received at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing are\nfraudulent.\n\n   Here in Canada's Pacific province, which has the nation's\nsecond-highest tax rate and 8.6 percent unemployment, economic\nfactors fuel local anger.
