Times News Service   \n\n   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The chaotic lands of the Balkans have become\nthe latest gateway to Western Europe for tens of thousands of\nillegal immigrants from China, South Asia and Middle Eastern\ncountries like Iran and Iraq, according to Western diplomats, local\nofficials and the increasing number of refugees caught      making the\njourney.\n\n   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, in particular, has\nopened the gates to thousands of Chinese intent on reaching Western\nEurope. Under Milosevic, Yugoslavia has cultivated strong ties with\nChina, which was Belgrade's ally during the war over Kosovo last\nyear.\n\n   Yugoslav consulates in China freely grant tourist visas to\nChinese, and the legal passage to Yugoslavia eases the way for\nillegal entry to the rest of Europe. Typically, the Chinese arrive\nby plane in Belgrade, then travel to Bosnia and here to Croatia.\nThen they head for the Adriatic coast and hope to reach Italy.\n\n   Bosnia has its own flow of illegal immigrants from Iran, Iraq\nand other countries with which the Muslim-led government in\nSarajevo maintains strong ties out of gratitude for the support of\nIran and Arab nations during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.\n\n   But Croatia is experiencing a staggering increase in human\ntraffic. Barely a week goes by without a new report of dozens of\nChinese or other migrants being caught on the coast or inland.\n\n   The authorities here have caught 10,000 illegal immigrants\ntrying to cross into Croatia in the first half of this year,\ncompared with 8,000 in all of 1999. On Aug. 12, for instance, 52\nillegal immigrants were sent back to Bosnia, with which Croatia\nshares a 1,200-mile, largely mountainous and unpatrolled border. A\nfew days later, 36 more were caught in the town of Varazdin, close\nto the border with Hungary and Slovenia, said Miroslav Cindori, the\nhead of a detention center outside Zagreb.\n\n   In Cindori's center, a converted motel, young men in track suits\nand plastic sandals wander around, using sign language to beg for\ncigarettes through the wire fence. Mostly Chinese, these men are\nillegal immigrants caught by the Croatian authorities, and they now\nawait deportation. They represent a minuscule part of Europe's\nlatest headache caused by Belgrade.\n\n   The 85 men and two women detained here have mostly come through\nin groups, organized by a shadowy but extensive criminal network of\nhuman traffickers, who are suddenly using the Balkans for access to\nEurope, said Duc Tran of the International Organization for\nMigration, in Zagreb.\n\n   None of the Chinese detainees wanted to talk or be photographed.\nBut other detainees, from Bangladesh, Tunisia and Iraq, were eager\nto talk and urgently asked for help. ``We took the wrong road,''\nShahabuddin, from Dhaka, Bangladesh, explained sheepishly. ``We\nwanted to go to Italy, and they stopped us and said, `No, this is\nCroatia.'''\n\n   Their stories appear to confirm the growing alarm among Western\ndiplomats and migration officials that a sophisticated and\nfar-reaching network of human traffickers from Asia has switched\nits attention from the United States and is now looking to Europe.\nThe traffickers have found that the troubled and unruly countries\nof the former Yugoslavia, with porous borders and a lack of\nimmigration laws and agreements, are an ideal gateway to the West.\n\n   Officials in Croatia recently signed an agreement with Bosnia in\nan effort to halt the human flow, but they lack the diplomatic\ncontacts needed to reach a similar agreement with Milosevic's\ngovernment in Belgrade.   \n\n   (MORE)    \nnn\n\n   Chinese gangs have switched the focus of their activities toward\nEurope, Tran said. ``There has been a change in the final\ndestination since the clampdown by the U.S. government, which has\ncut down illegal immigration to the United States,'' he said.\n``Europe is now the specific destination of the Chinese.''\n\n   In past years, Tran has dealt with waves of illegal immigrants\nfrom China who passed through Central America in an attempt to get\nto North America. It is estimated that as many as 500,000 Chinese\ntried to emigrate last year, he said.\n\n   A large number of these people are now coming to Europe, taking\nadvantage of the new Yugoslav route.\n\n   ``What triggered it was the granting of visas by Belgrade,''\nTran said. ``Two DC-10's come in a week to Belgrade. You pay $500\nto $900 for a ticket, and you are in Belgrade.''\n\n   The Serbian capital has a sizable Chinese community and an\nentire Chinese section in the vast open-air market that grew up in\nBelgrade over the last decade to circumvent sanctions and enable\npeople in Belgrade to buy smuggled consumer goods. The groups of\nChinese arriving by plane ``are not going to Serbia for business,''\nTran said. ``They may do some trade, but their final destination is\nEurope.''\n\n   The lucky immigrants who make it through Bosnia and Croatia head\nfor Italy by boat. Once there, they can travel freely within the\nblock of European Union countries that are bound by the Schengen\nagreement and have abolished passport checks.\n\n   Belgrade is almost certainly making money out of the scheme,\nsaid Dr. Thomas O'Rourke, acting chief of mission in Zagreb for the\nInternational Office of Migration. Besides the visa and ticket\nsales, there is talk that the Chinese can buy residency permits in\nSerbia for a few thousand dollars, Tran said.\n\n   Diplomats and immigration officials add that Milosevic, already\nindicted on charges of war crimes and widely viewed as an\ninternational pariah, may enjoy causing another problem for his\nfoes. ``He's irritating the West and making money at the same\ntime,'' said a European diplomat in Zagreb.\n\n   Yet the real concern is that the movement of illegal immigrants\nappears to be highly organized and run by international criminal\nrings who have realized that smuggling people for high fees is more\nprofitable and less risky than trafficking drugs, Tran said.\n\n   The traffic in Chinese migrants in Western Europe came to light\nin June when the bodies of 58 Chinese were found in an airtight\ncontainer on a truck in Dover, England.\n\n   The Chinese travel in groups, and are often shipped to\nprearranged employers, who then recoup the cost from the\nimmigrants' wages in sweatshops or restaurants or in the sex trade.\nPassage to the West can cost up to $60,000, O'Rourke said. In some\ncases, a whole village will join together to send the young men\nabroad so they can then support the village with their foreign\nearnings, said Cindori of the immigrant detention center.\n\n   The latest group of 35 Chinese men in his center were arrested\nin the coastal port of Sibenik after they were returned from Italy.\nThey had no passports and said very little when they arrived,\nCindori said, but after a few days a phone call was made.\n\n   Then, he said, their passports started arriving in the mail,\nsome from Belgrade, some from Sarajevo and some from Zagreb. All\nthe men are from the same place in China, the coastal province of\nZhejiang. They received tourist visas at the Yugoslav consulate in\nnearby Shanghai and flew into Belgrade, Cindori said.\n\n   The Muslims who come through Bosnia arrive on flights from\nIstanbul and Tehran. A plane arrives from Iran every week and\nreturns empty, Tran said. ``As soon as they get off the plane,\nthere are buses waiting outside, and they are gone,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nAS FLOW OF IMMIGRANTS TO EUROPE GROWS, THE BURDEN FALLS ON\nCROATIA \n","Text":["\n   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The chaotic lands of the Balkans have become\nthe latest gateway to Western Europe for tens of thousands of\nillegal immigrants from China, South Asia and Middle Eastern\ncountries like Iran and Iraq, according to Western diplomats, local\nofficials and the increasing number of refugees caught      making the\njourney.\n","\n   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, in particular, has\nopened the gates to thousands of Chinese intent on reaching Western\nEurope.
