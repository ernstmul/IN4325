CHEN   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ It was around 11 a.m. Friday when 21-year-old\nCheng Xing Da finally felt a little less lonely in an unfamiliar\nland.\n\n   Like 22 other Chinese men who illegally landed on a New Jersey\nbeach two months ago and have since been detained by federal\nauthorities, Cheng had seen few familiar faces other than\nbusiness-minded judges, lawyers, translators and reporters. But on\nFriday, when he made another appearance at an immigration court\nhere to request his release on bond, he noticed a gaunt, balding\nman with a toothless smile and an oversize suit _ a man he said was\nhis uncle.\n\n   Cheng did not say anything at first; he just smiled, nodded and\nshook his uncle's hands vigorously, repeatedly. After the uncle\npromised Judge Mirlande Tadal that he would take care of Cheng, he\nwhispered to Cheng in the Fuzhou dialect, ``I'll try to get you\nout.''\n\n   Friday was a day of muted family reunions, as relatives of nine\nof the 23 detainees offered testimony to support the men's release\non bond, giving a human dimension to a tale that had so far been\nthe province of legal procedure.\n\n   In all, there were 19 bond hearings Friday before Tadal and\nJudge Esmeralda Cabrera in the Immigration and Naturalization\nService's case to deport the men to China. And for the families, at\nleast, the results seemed promising: Bond was set for most of the\nmen, including Cheng, at $5,000.\n\n   But whether the reunions can actually resume outside federal\ncustody remains to be seen. The U.S. attorney's office in New\nJersey has issued warrants to arrest any, or all, of the 23, as\nwitnesses in a continuing criminal investigation into human\nsmuggling _ meaning that if the men make bail, they face the\nprospect of being transferred immediately to another jail. This\nhappened on Thursday, for instance, to Jiang Dian Lu, 22, who was\ntaken to Passaic County Jail after his relatives posted a $5,000\nbond.\n\n   In addition, one of the detainees, Chen Chen, appeared Friday in\na U.S. District Court in Newark, where bond was set at $20,000,\nsaid Robert Porges, the lawyer for 21 of the 23 Chinese men. Porges\nsaid he did not know why Chen was separated from the group several\nweeks ago and transferred to Mercer County Jail before appearing in\nNewark Friday.\n\n   And at the same time, the federal investigation into Chinese\nsmuggling seems to be gaining momentum. Faith Hochberg, the U.S.\nattorney in New Jersey, announced Friday that a federal grand jury\nin Newark had indicted six Koreans for conspiring to smuggle the 23\nChinese men whose boat ran aground near Bay Head, N.J., on May 30.\nThe six are alleged to have been participants in an international\nsmuggling operation that transported the 23, and other Chinese,\nfrom Fujian province in China via South America to the United\nStates. Five of the six are in custody.\n\n   But here in Elizabeth, where the detention center is wedged\nbetween industrial buildings and trucking-related businesses, the\nflurry of official proceedings Friday seemed secondary to the\npersonal transactions occurring inside the court.\n\n   ''It's unusual to have relatives testify at bond hearings; it's\nthe first time that's ever happened,'' Porges said. ``But this is\nwhat the judge wanted.''\n\n   Some of the relatives arrived two hours early for the 9 a.m.\nbond hearings, passing the time by reading Chinese-language\nnewspapers and smoking cigarettes, with some squatting on the\nfloor.\n\n   Most said they lived in New York City. And most did not want to\nbe interviewed by reporters. But one woman, who declined to give\nher name, said her brother was one of the detainees. ``I haven't\nseen him for many years,'' she said. ``He didn't tell me why he\nleft, but I know that our family is poor.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Inside the courtroom, the atmosphere veered from tense to\nlighthearted. The first detainee, Ni Zhou Yong, smiled and said,\n``Hey'' as his cousin entered the witness box.
