So trusting\nare Immigration and Naturalization Service officials that,\nnormally, only a surveillance camera guards the border crossing\nafter the federal agent goes home for the day.\n\n   But a lot has changed this week.\n\n   For the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, US border\nofficials have been put on a heightened state of alert, and they\nare particularly concerned about the 798-mile stretch of the border\nalong New England. Not only is the rural, wooded border lightly\nguarded, but it is near the major Canadian cities of Montreal and\nQuebec.\n\n   Over the years, smugglers of everything from cigarettes to\nillegal aliens have found the New England border an easy target.\nBut the arrests this week in Vermont of two people amid speculation\nthey may be involved in terrorism has cast the smuggling issue in a\nmore sinister light.\n\n   ``I'm concerned about the border out here. I'm wondering if it's\npossible for (terrorists) to go across because it is such a remote\narea. It would be an easy job at night,'' said Donna Gilman,\npostmaster in Brookton, which provides mail to Forest City. ``It\ngives me pause.''\n\n   Officials at the Immigration and Naturalization Service say they\nhave ratcheted up security along the 5,500-mile US-Canadian border\nmore as a precaution than in response to a specific threat.\nChristmas vacations for Border Patrol agents are being cancelled,\nand staff increased so that no one works alone and all official\nborder checkpoints, including tiny Forest City, have 24-hour\nstaffing.\n\n   ``We want to be on the safe side,'' said Raymond Kelly, director\nof the US Customs Service, which manages border checkpoints along\nwith INS. ``It's prudent. It's not in response to any specific\nthreat. We just think it's wise to do it.''\n\n   But, with only 107 Border Patrol agents assigned to guard the\nentire region, some federal law enforcement officials believe more\nare needed to pose a real threat to border jumpers.\n\n   ``If someone wants to carry out an intelligent plan to cross the\nborder undetected, I'd say the chances of them getting through are\npretty good,'' said Jay McCloskey, the U.S. Attorney for Maine, who\nhas prosecuted numerous immigration cases during a 20-year-career.\n\n   Sunday's arrest of Bouabide Chamchi, an Algerian, along with\nCanadian Lucia Garofalo, at the border crossing in Beecher Falls in\nnortheastern Vermont came very close to home for some people.\nCoupled with the earlier arrest of an Algerian Ahmed Ressam in\nWashington on charges of trying to smuggle bomb-making supplies\ninto the country, it put a threatening new focus on the world's\nlongest open border.\n\n   ``We know that some of these entry locations may have been\nidentified by terrorist groups and we've cancelled all annual\nleave,'' said Roland Richardson, deputy chief with the US Border\nPatrol in Houlton, Maine. ``All of our agents are on the job and\nhappy to be there given the possibility of entries that could be\ncoming through here.''\n\n   In truth, the US-Canada border, unlike the US border with\nMexico, was never designed to be leak-proof.

Some of the 36 other official border\ncrossings in the region, such as Pittsburg, N.H., receive fewer\nthan 100 border crossings a day.\n\n   In addition, for long stretches of the 600-mile Maine border\nwith Canada, only unguarded logging roads connect the two\ncountries.
