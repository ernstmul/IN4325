The club\noften trains on the access road running past the secondary\ncheckpoint 14 miles north of the border town.\n\n   ``It was unique and it took a little bit of planning and\nforethought to come up with this,'' said Assistant Chief John\nSmietana, who heads the Border Patrol anti-smuggling detail in\nLaredo. ``Obviously, someone was watching our operations and saw\nthis road being used by bicyclists.''\n\n   Authorities are not sure how the immigrants got past primary\ncheckpoints along the border. But once in Laredo, the immigrants\npaid $1,500 for passage to San Antonio, agents believe.\n\n   The subterfuge might have gone on for a year before it was\ndiscovered. Smietana said agents' view of the access road is\nobstructed when large trucks or buses are backed up at the\ncheckpoint.\n\n   After being tipped to the ploy, agents watched the checkpoint\nparticularly closely on July 4.\n\n   They saw two cyclists speed past the checkpoint on the access\nroad. The agents watched as the cyclists met up with a man in a\npickup. The man loaded them and their bicycles and drove north on\nI-35 until agents pulled him over.\n\n   The driver, Pedro Gonzalez-Davila, a 42-year-old Mexican citizen\nwho lives in San Antonio, was arrested and charged with aiding and\nabetting illegal entry. Gonzalez-Davila   ,    a legal resident, also\ncould face deportation as a result of the charges. His 1997 Ford\npickup has been seized, Smietana said.\n\n   ``From the information we gathered ... he's been doing this for\napproximately a year,'' Smietana said. ``He'd do it two or three\ntimes a week with two to three aliens at a time, so it would look\nlike the normal bicycling groups that are out there.''\n\n   The $1,500 that Gonzalez-Davila charged each client included the\nuse of a bicycle, an outfit and helmet, along with a ride to San\nAntonio, Smietana said.\n\n   Gonzalez-Davila would drop his clients and bicycles off at a\nLaredo truck stop south of the checkpoint and meet up with them\nafter they cruised past the Border Patrol, Smietana said.\n\n   ``At $1,500 apiece, he was making some money at it,'' Smietana\nsaid. ``We thought it was kind of a novel idea, and it just goes to\nshow the ingenuity of the alien smugglers who try and beat our\nenforcement methods.''\n\n     \nXXXX END OF FILE\n\n   $$$\n","Headline":"\nBORDER IMMIGRANT SMUGGLERS SHIFT INTO NEW GEAR \n\n","Text":["\n   HARLINGEN, Texas _ In the past, Border Patrol agents have\ndiscovered undocumented immigrants in car trunks, engine\ncompartments, sealed freight cars and even stuffed into suitcases.\n","\n   But the latest smuggling ruse uncovered on the Fourth of July\noutside Laredo, Texas, has topped them all for sheer brazenness.\n","\n   A man is accused of smuggling undocumented immigrants past a\nBorder Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 35 by dressing them up as\nbicycle enthusiasts and having them pedal 10-speed cycles past\nunsuspecting agents.\n","\n   The immigrants were dressed to look like members of Laredo\ncycling clubs, complete with colorful outfits and helmets.
