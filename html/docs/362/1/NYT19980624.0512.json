Times News Service   \n\n   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ Honoring a government request for more time to\ninvestigate how 23 Chinese men illegally landed on a New Jersey\nbeach last month, two immigration judges postponed hearings\nWednesday on whether the men should be released on bond.\n\n   Irene Feldman, an assistant district counsel for the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service, said that agency investigators would\nneed two more weeks to gauge whether any of the 23 would be needed\nas witnesses in a criminal investigation into human smuggling. Bond\nhearings had been scheduled for about half the immigrants\nWednesday.\n\n   ``There is still a concern for the safety of the individuals,''\nMs. Feldman said, suggesting that they might be harmed by the\nsmugglers if they were released.\n\n   Defense lawyers did not oppose the motion, saying it would be\npointless: government officials had already obtained court orders\nto detain the 23 men as witnesses regardless of the outcome of the\nbond hearings. As a result, Judges Esmeralda Cabrera and Mirlande\nTadal granted the motion, and bond hearings were set for the week\nof July 5.\n\n   Robert Porges, a Manhattan lawyer representing all but two of\nthe 23 men, said he doubted that the immigrants could offer much\ninformation about the smugglers behind their voyage.\n\n   ``They can describe what happened to them,'' Porges said. ``But\nI doubt they can give a lot of information as to how these people\noperate.''\n\n   The postponement of the bond hearings came on a busy if\nanticlimactic day in the government's case to deport the men back\nto China. Among other actions, lawyers for the men submitted\nseveral applications for political asylum, and the judges scheduled\nseveral asylum hearings in August and September. The same routine _\ndelaying bond hearings and scheduling asylum hearings _ is expected\non Thursday for the rest of the men.\n\n   Going into Wednesday's proceedings, there had been an air of\nanticipation because of the prospect that some of the 23 would be\nreunited, if only briefly, with some of their relatives in the\nUnited States. The relatives were scheduled to offer testimony to\nsupport the men's release on bond.\n\n   Two of the men's relatives, New York residents, remained in a\nreception area all morning, outside the courtrooms. They were later\ntold to return in two weeks.\n\n   The relatives _ one a young man with a crew cut who spoke little\nEnglish, the other an elderly woman with the demeanor of a\nconcerned aunt who could only speak the Fuzhou dialect spoken by\nthe detainees _ politely declined to talk to reporters.\n\n   In the only public comments to date made by any of the 23 men,\none 25-year-old man from the small farming community of Minjiangko,\nnot far from the city of Fuzhou in Fujian province, described parts\nof his journey to The New York Times last week. He said the men had\nspent considerable time in a South American country, waiting with\nperhaps 200 other men to make a voyage to the United States.\nNewspaper reports have indicated that the country was Suriname.\n\n   The men left South America two or three months ago, squeezing\nonto a large vessel for the trip north in the Atlantic.
