Times News Service   \n\n   With the seizure of a freighter that is suspected of smuggling\nAsian immigrants into the Bahamas this week, federal officials said\nthey were beginning to piece together the circuitous journey of 23\nChinese men who illegally landed on a New Jersey beach two weeks\nago.\n\n   The 120-foot-long ship seized in the Caribbean, the Oriental I,\nmay have been a so-called mother ship used in one phase of a\nsmuggling operation involving many vessels, the authorities said.\n\n   The Oriental I, now in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard, was\nintercepted about 195 miles east of San Salvador Island on Monday.\nOnly an eight-man crew _ comprised of four Venezuelan and four\nKorean nationals _ was on board at the time it was seized. But the\nday before, U.S. Customs officials, watching from an airplane, saw\na group of people leaving the ship in a speedboat, which raced them\nto Abaco Island in the Bahamas.\n\n   Bahamian police were alerted and later found 24 Asian men _ 23\nfrom China and one from Malaysia _ hiding near the island town of\nHole in the Wall. Those men have been detained as illegal aliens.\n\n   Federal officials say they believe the freighter, which is\nregistered in Venezuela, also played a role in the smuggling of the\nChinese immigrants who were dumped on the beach at Bay Head, N.J.,\non May 30.\n\n   The immigrants had traveled near the U.S. coast on the Oriental\nI and were then transferred to a smaller boat, the Oops II, the\nauthorities said. But the Oops II lost its way in dense fog and ran\naground, leaving the immigrants to jump into the surf and flee\ntoward the mansions lining the shore of the wealthy town.\n\n   The men were rounded up over the next few days and taken to the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service detention center in\nElizabeth, N.J. The immigrants' lawyers have said they will all ask\nfor political asylum because they fear persecution in China.\n\n   Officials said they doubted that either group of immigrants _\nthose who ended up in New Jersey and those who were caught in the\nBahamas _ had traveled all the way from China on the freighter.\n\n   A lawyer for one of the immigrants who landed in New Jersey said\nthat the smuggling route began in South America, the Associated\nPress reported.\n\n   ``My guy's trip took about two months,'' said the lawyer, Jules\nCoven.
