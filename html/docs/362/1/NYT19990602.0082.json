That case shocked even veteran Border Patrol agents who\nthought they had encountered every callous tactic used by\nsmugglers.\n\n   Over the years, the lucrative criminal organizations that\nsmuggle people across the border have amassed a horrific legacy.\nThey have locked their clients in car trunks, left them to die by\nthe scores in unventilated truck trailers and freight cars,\nabandoned them without water in blistering heat, hid them amid\nshipments of hazardous waste and led them into raging surf, where\nthey drowned.\n\n   But using infants as living ``props'' has increased as intensive\nborder-control campaigns from here to California have made it\nharder to slip across the U.S.-Mexico border, said U.S. Border\nPatrol officials.\n\n   To get their clients through, smugglers are now pairing up\nunrelated men and women and providing them with an infant so they\nappear to be a family. And because there are no facilities where\nfamilies can be detained together while awaiting immigration\nhearings, these ``family units'' are routinely released by the\nBorder Patrol and allowed to continue their northward journey,\nofficials explain.\n\n   ``They're resorting to this, and it's unfortunate the babies are\nsuffering,'' said Border Patrol agent John L. Trevino, who heads\nthe anti-smuggling unit in Brownsville.\n\n   In the case of ``Baby Doe,'' the infant was rented by smugglers\nwho provided her to three different sets of clients who swam or\nwaded across the Rio Grande River with the child. The infant's real\nparents, undocumented Honduran citizens living in Houston, have\nadmitted renting their baby for $200 per trip, Trevino said. They\nare now in custody.\n\n   ``What these smugglers have done is caught on to the fact we are\na humanitarian society,'' explained Border Patrol Assistant Chief\nHarry Beall of the McAllen, Texas, sector. ``We do care for the\nwelfare of the people we detain, and they are using that compassion\nto circumvent the system.''\n\n   Beall said smugglers are aware that undocumented adults who are\ndetained by themselves on the border will languish in detention\nuntil they get a hearing. But those who can convince agents that\nthey are a family are instead given a notice to appear before an\nimmigration judge at a later date and then are released with travel\ndocuments.\n\n   ``They've caught on to this, and what they're doing is\nfurnishing babies for them to carry,'' Beall said of the smugglers.\n``We've seen an increase in it. But as far as being able to prove\nit, it's hard because these kids are of such a tender age we can't\nask (the children) questions.''\n\n   The case of ``Baby Doe'' began to unravel on the late afternoon\nof March 30 at the Brownsville Border Patrol station, as agent\nGriselda Vidrio was helping other agents process a young ``family''\nfrom Honduras. The man and woman _ both in their early 30s and\ncarrying a 6-month-old _ had earlier flagged down Border Patrol\nagents along the Rio Grande in Brownsville and surrendered,\nconfident they would be released shortly after processing.\n\n   ``I looked at the baby, she smiled at me, and I said, `I've seen\nthis baby before,''' said Vidrio.\n\n   ``I informed the agent who was processing the couple that I\nrecognized the baby,'' Vidrio said. ``So I started asking the lady\nwhose baby it was, and she said it was hers. But I don't know,\nthere was something strange about it that made me keep on asking.''\n\n   Vidrio also noticed the ``mother'' seemed unpracticed at holding\na baby and had brought only two diapers, one bottle of formula and\nno extra clothes. The agent also recalled seeing the red, beaded\nbracelet, strung with turquoise stones, that the baby was wearing\non her right wrist.\n\n   ``I knew I had seen this baby before with someone else. I\nremember a man coming in (with the baby for processing by Border\nPatrol agents) where he said his wife had died during the Hurricane\nMitch'' disaster in Central America, Vidrio said.\n\n   Pressed by Vidrio, the young woman admitted the child was not\nhers, but claimed the baby had been given to her by a man she met\nin Mexico. Eventually she admitted the child was provided by\nsmugglers whom she had paid $1,000 to get her to Houston. The\nsmugglers had given her instructions on how to return the infant\nafter the ``couple'' reached Houston by bus.\n\n   Agents began to search through the files they kept on families\nwho had been processed and released in Brownsville, and found the\nbaby in pictures taken of two other ``families'' released earlier\nin March.\n\n   The little girl was processed as part of one ``family'' March\n18, and then with another March 19, according to anti-smuggling\nagent Richard A. Serra.\n\n   ``To me, it's pretty cold. ... This is the first time I've seen\na baby used this way,'' he said, adding that doctors who examined\nthe infant found she was suffering from a slight cold and the\nbeginning of an ear infection.\n\n   ``It kind of shocks you, even though you get kind of callous ...\n,'' Serra said.\n\n   Border Patrol agents handed the infant over to state child\nwelfare workers in Brownsville, and went after the smugglers.\n\n   Immigration agents placed a southwest Houston apartment under\nsurveillance after identifying it from the telephone number the\nsmugglers gave the couple to call when they arrived in Houston.\n\n   Posing as the clients, the agents called the apartment from the\nbus station and told a woman who answered that they had arrived\nwith the baby. The woman said someone would meet them at the\nstation.\n\n     \n(MORE)  \n\n   Agents arrested Sandra Patricia Orellana, 29, as she left the\napartment. Investigators say she is the one who answered the phone.\nThey later arrested Jose Antonio Guerrero Funez, 34, of Honduras,\nat the bus station after he met with the agents, Serra said.\n\n   Guerrero was indicted April 28 on charges of encouraging or\ninducing immigrants to enter or remain in the United States, a\nfelony punishable by 10 years in prison and a maximum $250,000\nfine, said assistant U.S. attorney Doug Davis.\n\n   Charges against Orellana have been dismissed, Davis said.\nImmigration and Naturalization Service officials in Houston say\ndeportation proceedings are under way.\n\n   The man and woman who posed as a family with the baby are being\nheld as material witnesses. Serra said they identified Guerrero in\na photo lineup as the smuggler who gave them ``Baby Doe'' and\ninstructed them to pose as a married couple.\n\n   Meanwhile, two Hondurans claiming to be the infant's parents\nwent to the Houston Police Department and reported their child\nmissing after the infant and the smuggling couple failed to show up\nas expected.\n\n   The parents are being detained after admitting they rented their\nchild for use in the smuggling operation, according to federal\nofficials.\n\n     \n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   While this case is the only time immigration agents say they\nhave been able to document the use of infants by a smuggling\norganization, it is not the first time young children have been\ncaught up in this desperate trade.\n\n   On Feb. 3, a young couple from the state of Veracruz in Mexico\nwalked up to the information booth at the INS office at the Gateway\nBridge in Brownsville to report their daughter missing.\n\n   The distraught couple told Delia Gantt, an INS information\nofficer, that they had hired smugglers the month before to take\ntheir 15-month-old daughter across the Rio Grande while they\nattempted the crossing on their own. The couple had been arrested\non the Texas side of the river and returned to Mexico, but had not\nbeen able to make contact with the smugglers who had their baby.\n\n   ``You could tell they were two young kids looking for their lost\nbaby. You could tell by the look on their faces,'' said Gantt, who\nsaid the mother was 17 and the father 24.\n\n   Houston police had located the toddler in a motel room with\ndozens of other undocumented immigrants, INS spokesman Art Moreno\nsaid.\n\n   It was only luck that kept the toddler from being sold on the\nblack market or pressed into service by smugglers, he said.\n\n   ``I don't know what the smuggler would have done with that child\n... because smugglers have absolutely no moral ethics, nor do they\nhave any regard for human life,'' he said. ``I'm sorry to sound so\nhard, but I've seen what they can do.
