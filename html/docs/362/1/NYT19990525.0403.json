Witnesses said they paid as much as $1,500 to be\nferried to the United States from the Bahamas. Attorneys for both\nsides said guidelines likely will limit his sentence to little more\nthan the 3 mandatory years.\n\n   The jury found Hepburn guilty of eight counts of smuggling,\neight counts of smuggling for financial gain and one count of\nsmuggling that resulted in death. While federal prosecutors believe\n33 Haitian immigrants were on the 23-foot motor boat piloted by\nHepburn the night of Aug. 10, they could identify only eight\npassengers.

Two Haitians died struggling\nbetween the sandbar and the beach.\n\n   Hepburn, who was later nabbed as he slept on his broken-down\nboat, was held responsible for the drowning death of Benette\nDorsonne.
