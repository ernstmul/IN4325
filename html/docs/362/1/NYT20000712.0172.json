Over the past year, hundreds of\nclandestine Mexican migrants have allegedly paid the ingenious\nsmuggler $1500 each to take part in what Texan analyst John Tedesco\nterms a ``Tour de Fraud.''\n\n   Officials in the area had become accustomed to seeing clusters\nof lycra-clad cyclists zip along the narrow access road that runs\nbetween the official checkpoint at Laredo and the I-35 highway\nleading to San Antonio, the nearest big city.\n\n   Aside from local ranchers and cycling teams training for\nendurance, there was rarely any traffic on this unmarked strip.\n\n   Three times a week, Pedro Gonzalez, a wealthy San Antonio\nresident, would direct groups of up to four cyclists in borrowed\ngear to ride past.\n\n   By putting their water supply in sporty clip-on bottles rather\nthan in the plastic jugs which illegal migrants usually carry on\ntheir way north from Nuevo Laredo, and then suiting up in the\nlatest cycling attire, these bogus bikers avoided detection even\nthough their cycling skills were sometimes distinctly wobbly.\n\n   Almost all of them were young men, between the ages of 18 and\n40.\n\n   According to John Smietana, a border patrol agent, the novel\nscheme took advantage of a constant backlog of bulky recreational\nvehicles and trucks at the main checkpoint that effectively blocked\nthe officials' view of the access road.\n\n   Gonzalez, 42, would regularly haul his collection of ten-speed\nracing bicycles in the back of his pickup truck along with his\nhuman cargo and unsuspecting officials recognized him and waved him\nthrough.\n\n   ``He would drop the aliens south of the checkpoint, drive\nthrough, and wait up north for them,'' Smietana said. ``They'd\npedal past on the access road. Then about a mile up the road, he'd\npick them up.''\n\n   Gonzalez was arrested on charges of aiding and abetting illegal\nentry after undercover agents, tipped off to the scheme, witnessed\ntwo cyclists stashing their equipment inside his pickup on July 4.\n\n   ``They're always looking for innovative ways to beat us and this\nwas very innovative,'' said Al Moreno, the head intelligence agent\nalong the Laredo frontier. ``They will stop. Their method has been\nrevealed.''\n\n   The cycling scam apparently was limited to the main highway into\nSan Antonio. At lonelier outposts, groups of amateur cyclists would\nhave been much more conspicuous.\n\n   In the past year, Texas border patrolmen have intercepted over\n120,000 undocumented Mexicans and say there has been a 23 percent\nincrease in illegal migrants who pay smuggling rings.\n\n   With standard border crossings reinforced with extra security,\nand an outbreak of volunteer ranchers who stop migrants at gunpoint\nand hand them over to the border patrol, job-seekers sneaking into\nthe United States rarely go it alone.\n\n   They regularly risk crossing unpatrolled barren stretches with\nthe help of unscrupulous ``coyotes,'' who are apt to abandon them\nif officials approach.\n\n   In the past nine months, 238 Mexicans have died of exposure\nwhile trying to cross high desert, and surveillance planes used by\nthe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service patrols are\nincreasingly deployed for search and rescue.\n\n   To boost their chances of arrival, many cross-border immigrants\nare willing to pay ``coyote'' guides large sums for their\nexpertise. The $1,500 fee charged by Gonzalez represents a full\nyear's savings for most of these would-be workers.\n\n   Once they find jobs in the United States, Mexican migrants send\nhome an annual $8 billion in revenues to Mexico.\n\n   Mexico's new president-elect, Vicente Fox, said ``You will never\nstop immigration with guns or by building fences'' and promotes an\nopen border and rapid economic growth that will eventually increase\nwages on both sides of the frontier.\n\n   The pro-business politician envisions a common market and single\ncurrency economy in place within decades. Rocio Culebro, Amnesty\nInternational's director in Mexico, has urged the new president to\nguarantee the human rights of citizens crossing the border when he\nassumes office in December.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 750-word article from THE INDEPENDENT newspaper in\nLondon, it must be purchased from the New York Times Syndicate's\nsales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at\n732-390-4697.
