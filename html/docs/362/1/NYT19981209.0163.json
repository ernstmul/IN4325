Saleb paid $3,000 for the first leg of his\njourney, which was to take him from Chwarta, his hometown in\nnorthern Iraq, to Istanbul, Turkey. From there he hoped to make his\nway to Germany.\n\n   ``I was nervous but also very excited when the deal was done,''\nhe says of his first brush with the traffickers who smuggle people\ninto the EU for cash.\n\n   But Saleb's escape to freedom turned sour early on.\n\n   Along with 10 other Iraqi Kurds and one trafficker, he set off\non foot through the rugged mountains that divide Iraq and Iran. For\nsix days, they hiked in single file, dodging villages and border\nchecks, eating dried fruit on the hoof, stopping only to sleep.\nSaleb, a slight man with fine features, says his pleas for rest\nwere ignored.\n\n   On the third day, an Iranian border patrol suddenly appeared on\na nearby ridge and opened fire, wounding a Kurd named Ali. The rest\nof the group scrambled to safety. The trafficker _ a rough,\ntaciturn man _ refused to go back for their fallen companion.\n\n   Saleb is still not sure what happened to Ali.\n\n   ``That trafficker had no human feelings,'' he says, his voice\ndropping. ``We were only cargo for him, and one death was no big\nmatter.''\n\n   Eventually the group made its way across the border into Turkey,\nwhere a dusty truck was waiting. It drove to the city of\nDiyarbakir, where a Turkish man made up false documents for the\ngroup. The Kurds then boarded a series of buses for Istanbul.\nThere, with traffickers peddling trips to everywhere in the EU,\nSaleb paid $5,000 _ the rest of his savings _ to a Turk offering\nsafe passage by land to Bavaria, in Germany.\n\n   ``We were so happy when we thought we had arrived in Germany\nthat one of the men, an Iranian, bent down and kissed the ground,''\nSaleb says, rubbing his bloodshot eyes.\n\n   Saleb still remembers with bitterness the moment it dawned on\nhim that he had been duped.\n\n   ``When I realized that the road signs were not written in\nGerman, my heart was broken.''\n\n   The Turkish trafficker had dumped his passengers in Kyjov, a\nsmall town here in the Czech Republic.\n\n   Months later, Saleb still has not reached the promised land of\nWestern Europe. The unmarried Saleb is now in Prague, the\npicturesque Czech capital that has become a key transit point on\nthe smuggling routes to the European Union.\n\n   With no legal right to be here, Saleb is doing odd jobs in the\nblack economy to scrabble together enough cash for a final run at\nthe walls of Fortress Europe.\n\n   But even as he squirrels away his meager earnings, thousands of\nother migrants are queuing up for the chance to buy their way into\nthe EU.\n\n   As in the United States, the tightening of border security is\nforcing people such as Saleb into the arms of professional\ntraffickers.\n\n   The Vienna-based International Center for Migration Policy\nDevelopment estimates that migrants pay gangs promising to smuggle\nthem into Western Europe $2 billion to $4 billion every year.\n\n   Many traffickers along the EU border are small-time operators\ntrying to make some extra cash on the weekend. But authorities say\nthe trade is fast becoming a sophisticated branch of organized\ncrime, with some smugglers also dabbling in guns and drugs.\n\n   According to police investigators, EU traffickers _ even more\nthan their peers in Mexico _ are plugging into networks with\noffices and agents across the Third World. They have access to\nexpert document forgers. Many use high-tech gear often associated\nwith James Bond movies: satellite phones, high-speed boats and\ncars, night-vision binoculars, sensors for eavesdropping on police\nradios.\n\n   Traffickers of many nationalities operate along every flank of\nthe European Union. They can be contacted through bars and cafes\ndotted along the coast of North Africa. In Ceuta, a Spanish enclave\non the edge of Morocco, top smugglers are folk heroes, with\nnicknames like El Nene (The Kid) and El Rey de las Lanchas (The\nKing of the Motorboats).\n\n   Saleb chose Istanbul as his launch pad into the EU. With both\nIraq and Turkey locked in bloody conflict with Kurdish rebels,\nEuropean intelligence sources estimate that as many as 3 million\nKurds, many of them dreaming of a fresh start in the West, are\nholed up in and around the ancient Turkish port city.\n\n   Saleb, whose brother was accused of terrorist activity by Saddam\nHussein's police, stayed in a run-down boarding house in Kucuk\nPazar, an Istanbul neighborhood that draws a steady stream of\nEU-bound migrants and the traffickers who seek their business.\n\n   Most of the smugglers offered boat rides to Italy and Greece,\nSaleb says. But because he has a deep fear of drowning, Saleb opted\ninstead for an overland trip to Germany.\n\n   Istanbul ``is like a giant bazaar, with so many people offering\nto take you anywhere you want to go in (Western) Europe,'' he says.\n\n   Experts say the former Soviet bloc is also crawling with\ntraffickers.\n\n   Each time Saleb wanders through the old train station in\ndowntown Prague, a stranger sidles up to him, whispering,\n``Germany? Germany?''\n\n   ``They make eye contact, they circle around, and then they\napproach you,'' he says. ``Usually they ask for lots of money.''\n\n   Like any smart business, the trafficking industry offers\nproducts to suit many budgets.\n\n   A well-heeled migrant from China can spend up to $30,000 on a\ndeluxe package deal that includes airplane tickets, good hotels and\na skillfully forged passport. At the bottom of the market, a Sri\nLankan peasant might pay $3,000 to be taken to the EU partly on\nfoot and partly in the back of a truck packed with people.\nTraffickers along the EU border itself charge as little as $1,000\nper head per crossing.\n\n   Authorities say, however, that bargain-hunters often get a raw\ndeal.\n\n   Some are put to work in sweatshops to pay off their trips.\nOthers are sold telephone numbers of non-existent ``contacts'' in\nthe EU. Most have little say over their final destination, since\ntraffickers vary the routes according to current policing, weather\nand laws.\n\n   Like Saleb, many migrants are dumped somewhere along the\nsmuggling route and told they have arrived in Germany or the\nNetherlands.\n\n   ``This is a cruel and unfair business where the rights of the\nconsumer, the migrant, count for nothing,'' says Lucie Sladkova,\nhead of the Migrations Information Center within the Czech\nRepublic's border police.\n\n   At the first sign of danger, traffickers often scamper, leaving\ntheir clients to face capture or worse. In winter, in the freezing\nmountains between Germany and the Czech Republic, border police\nhave come across migrants shivering in thin garments and sandals.\nMany have suffered severe frostbite, and some have died.\n\n   Yet the main migrant graveyard lies in the treacherous waters of\nthe Strait of Gibraltar, where the flimsy motorboats used by\ntraffickers often capsize. Aid agencies put the death toll this\nyear at around 1,000, compared with 3,000 in the previous 10 years.\n\n   The trend toward smuggling ever-larger groups is most visible on\nthe open waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Every so often, European\ncoast guards intercept a large ship packed with migrants. Though\nthe traffickers charge luxury-cruise prices, the conditions are\nusually appalling, authorities say.\n\n   Last December, Salah Taha, an Iraqi Kurd, paid $4,000 to travel\nin a ship from Istanbul to ``somewhere in Italy.''\n\n   The vessel was an aging freighter, and the 800 migrants were\nlocked in the cargo hold. Scraps of stale bread and water were\ndispensed once a day, Taha says. The single toilet backed up, so\npeople relieved themselves on the floor.\n\n   After a week, the crew, without warning, cut the engines and\nfled in motorboats. After drifting for hours, the freighter ran\naground on the coast of Calabria, in southern Italy.\n\n   ``They took all that money from us and put us into hell,'' says\nTaha, who, unlike most illegal migrants, was lucky enough to earn\nasylum in Italy. ``I still have nightmares about it.''\n\n   Even when they do reach the European Union, many migrants remain\nbeholden to the criminals who guided them there, police say. Some\ntraffickers, notably Chinese smugglers called ``snakeheads,'' have\nkidnapped their clients to extort money from their families back\nhome.\n\n   In the last two years, police in London have freed 15 Chinese\nmigrants held hostage by their fellow countrymen. Many were badly\nbeaten; one had been tied to a radiator for 12 days and his eardrum\nhad been punctured by the aerial of the mobile phone used to\nblackmail his terrified wife in China.\n\n   Police suspect that hundreds, maybe thousands, more migrants are\ntrapped in similar bondage across Western Europe.\n\n   EU governments are trying to end the traffic in people with\ntougher law enforcement and by pushing neighboring states to clamp\ndown. But the traffickers still seem to have the upper hand.\n\n   Though hundreds of smugglers have been sentenced to jail terms\nin Western Europe, many more have slipped through the legal\ndragnet. Physical evidence of their crimes is often scarce, and\nmost migrants are afraid to point the finger.\n\n   Outside the EU, say experts, many police forces remain corrupt\nand inefficient. Another problem is that many non-EU officials\nstill regard people-smuggling as a relatively benign crime.\n\n   In the days of the old Soviet bloc, ``anyone who trafficked\npeople into the West was a hero for us,'' says Sladkova, the\ndirector of the Czech Migrations Information Center. ``It's one\nthing to change the laws. It's another to change people's\nthinking.''\n\n   If the war on drugs is a marker, then authorities are also\nwaging an uphill battle against the laws of supply and demand. As\nlong as migrants are willing to tolerate the risk and cost of being\nsmuggled into the EU, then traffickers will be there for them.\n\n   On a clear, breezy evening in Prague, Saleb leans against the\nstone railing on the famous Charles Bridge, staring blankly at a\nGerman family posing for photographs.\n\n   He talks about traffickers like a junkie talks about his drug\ndealer. He cannot bring himself to just say no.\n\n   ``I know they are evil people, that they cheat us and leave us\nto die, but what else can I do?'' he asks.\n\n   ``I need them, because I cannot get into Western Europe by\nmyself.''\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nIMMIGRANT INFLUX GIVES RISE TO TRAFFIC IN HUMAN CARGO \n\n","Text":["\n   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Late last year, after his brother was\njailed and tortured by Saddam Hussein's police, Abdul Saleb began\nplotting ways to flee his native Iraq for a new life in the\nEuropean Union.\n","\n   Fearing for his own safety, the 26-year-old Kurdish physician\ndid what many would-be migrants lacking EU entry papers do\nnowadays.\n","\n   He turned to the underworld for help.\n","\n   A friend of a friend put him in touch with a local\n``businessman.''
