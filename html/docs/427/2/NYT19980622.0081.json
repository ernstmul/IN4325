PELZEL  \n c.1997 Consumers Digest\n\n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)     \n\n   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an\nunfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as\nmosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke\nor anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting\n_ can be life-threatening.\n\n   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily\nminimized, if you follow some simple precautions.\n   SOLAR MENACE     \n\n   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a\nsun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,\naccording to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000\nAmericans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The\nculprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.\n\n   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,\ndamaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and\nfirm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant\nmelanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.\n\n   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be\nactive participants in the other two types of skin cancer:\nbasal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.\n\n   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.\n\n   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking\nwindows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the\nglass -- or apply sunscreen.\n\n   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the\nsun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a\nsunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your\nblood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a\nsunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF\nby 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.\n\n   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at\nleast 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear\ntightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your\nface.\n\n   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the\ncontents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.\nAlso worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and\ncucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.\n   SUN AND EYES     \n\n   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and\nphotokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are\ndirectly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is\nthought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.\n\n   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep\neyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50\npercent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to\n100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption\nup to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.\n   SUN AND DEHYDRATION     \n\n   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin\nand eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat\nstroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash\nor prickly heat.\n\n   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses\nits ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your\nbreathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,\nsince the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The\nbest action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the\nbody with water until the ambulance arrives.\n\n   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature\nand a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your\nskin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of\nappetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which\ncan be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go\noutdoors.\n\n   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool\noff with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with\nyour feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the\nsymptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a\nhospital.\n\n   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by\nthe inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by\nwearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot\nshowers.\n\n   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum\npowder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of\nbaking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages\nwill help the body replenish lost liquids.\n   POISONOUS PLANTS     \n\n   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to\n50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and\nirritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the\nmost common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.\n\n   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap\ncalled urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct\ncontact, although it can also be spread by touching sports\nequipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has\nbrushed against the plant.\n\n   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't\nburn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung\ndamage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that\nlooks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as\nlong as 100 years.\n\n   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of\nprotection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves\nin groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white\nberries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.\n\n   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven\nand nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.\nIt usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or\nvine.\n\n   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13\nper branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas\nof the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with\nsmooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.\n\n   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before\ncoming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a\nlotion that dries to form a claylike coating.\n\n   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,\nimmediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a\ncloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your\nbody. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with\nurushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.\n\n   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A\nserious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes\nswell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the\nhospital.\n\n   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying\naloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made\nfrom baking soda and water.\n   STINGS AND BITES     \n\n   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,\nhornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most\ncommonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of\nAllergy.\n\n   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:\n\n   + Wear neutral colors.\n\n   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented\ndeodorant.\n\n   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.\n\n   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.\n\n   + Don't leave car windows open.\n\n   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees\nand wasps away from your area.\n\n   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a\ncredit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.\nThis action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release\nmore venom into the wound.\n\n   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,\nvinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.\n   MOSQUITOES AND TICKS     \n\n   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those\nwith DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.\nDEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against\nmosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about\npossible side effects.\n\n   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a\nlemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET\nrepellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based\nrepellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be\neffective against ticks.\n\n   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an\nEnvironmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating\nthat the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with\nminimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.\n\n   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,\nswabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups\nof baking soda to three cups of salt.\n\n     (Raquel E.
