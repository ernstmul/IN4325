I'm fortunate that mine haven't\nmoved over my pupils. That would obscure my vision and require\nsurgical removal.''\n\n   Evert retired from playing in 1989, having won three Wimbledon\nsingles titles along with two at the Australian Open, six at the\nUnited States Open and a record seven at the French Open.\n\n   She was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and her whole\nfamily is involved in tennis. Her father, Jimmy, retired in 1997\nfrom coaching at the local Holiday Park, where he instructed his\nfive children, Drew, Chris, Jeanne, John and Clare. Her mother,\nColette, is a club player.\n\n   ``Thirty years ago, when I started playing, we didn't have the\ntechnology to make this problem avoidable,'' Evert said. ``Then, if\nyou wanted to be visually sharp, you couldn't wear sunglasses. They\nwere just too dark to see the ball well.\n\n   ``Now we can have it both ways. There are sunglasses on the\nmarket that allow you to have total UV protection and excellent\nperformance on court.''\n\n   Players now have the choice of wearing glasses or contact lenses\nwhich enhance the eye's ability to see optic yellow objects, the\ncolor of most tennis balls, while muting the other colors and\nblocking 90 percent of UV rays.\n\n   At the recent Ericsson Open, in Key Biscayne, Fla., Wesley\nJessen, in partnership with Bolle, introduced their latest product,\navailable in both corrective and non-corrective lenses.\n\n   ``The tour has finally gotten the message about hats,'' Evert\nsaid. ``That took long enough. Next must be eye protection, but\nwithout sacrificing performance. There is no more important\nimprovement you can make in your game than to protect your eyes.\nThey're your windows on court and you can't replace them.''\n\n   Evert, formerly married to the British tennis player John Lloyd,\nhas three sons by her second husband, Andy Mill, an American former\nOlympic skier. She oversees the Evert Tennis Academy, in Boca\nRaton, Fla., and does television commentary.\n\n   In 1989 she founded Chris Evert Charities, which has raised more\nthan $10 million to fight drug abuse and to assist neglected,\ndrug-exposed and abused children.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 500-word article from THE INDEPENDENT newspaper in\nLondon, it must be purchased from the New York Times Syndicate's\nsales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at\n732-390-4697.
