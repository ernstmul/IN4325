Hurricane Doria Records. 11 tracks.\n\n   Grade: A-\n\n   Leading off your album with a track called ``Perfect'' is just\nbegging for trouble. You can hear jaded music critics sneering,\n```Perfect,' huh? We'll see about that.'' But Atlanta\nsinger-songwriter Doria Roberts' sophomore effort comes as close to\nflawless as a low-budget indie release can get. Roberts'\nmesmerizing voice, which grafts the whip-smart elocution of Ani\nDiFranco to the soul of Lauryn Hill, draws you in. Her evocative\nmeditations on love and hanging out, along with the warm production\nby longtime Atlanta folkie Dede Vogt, hold you. Just listen to the\nbrawny cello countermelody on the title track or the sumptuous bass\nline (supplied by Vogt) on ``Bluebird.'' If that's not perfection,\nI don't know what is.\n\n   _ Doug Hamilton\n\n   Doria Roberts performs July 30 at Eddie's Attic in Decatur\n(Ga.). 404-377-4976.\n\n      URBAN\n\n   ``Music From and Inspired\n\n   by the Motion Picture `The Wood' ''\n\n   Various artists. Jive. 18 tracks.\n\n   Grade: C+\n\n   Drop a piece of wood in a body of water and it'll sink, float\nback up and then just bob above and beneath the surface. Much like\n``The Wood'' soundtrack. It makes a splash with the spirited\nmatchup of rappers Mystikal and Outkast on ``Neck Uv Da Woods.''\nThen there's the desperate gasp for album filler: Blackstreet's\nlazy reworking of its remix of Janet Jackson's ``I Get Lonely''\ninto ``Think About You.'' And the Roots step in next, saving this\neffort from the stop button with the rap band's well-written boast,\n``Ya' All Know Who!'' Throughout, ``The Wood'' never thuds; it just\nfloats along with enough likable songs (Joe's ``I Wanna Know'') to\nbuoy the occasional bottom feeder (Night & Day's ``Dante's Girl'').\n\n   _ Sonia Murray\n\n      RAP\n\n   ``The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo''\n\n   Lil' Cease. Undeas/Atlantic. 21 tracks.\n\n   Grade: B\n\n   Lil' Cease's name was established in Notorious B.I.G.'s raps,\nbut when B.I.G was shot dead in the seat beside him in 1997, he\nstill hadn't established himself as an individual talent. In the\nnine-member hip-hop act Junior M.A.F.I.A., he was the\nswollen-tongued one with the lisp, who went on to prove himself\nquite comical on the million-selling team-up with Lil' Kim, ``Get\nMoney.'' Guess Cease figured combos were what worked for him, as\nonly one or two of the 21 tracks features Cease A Leo alone. ``Puff\nDaddy'' (``Need a Lady''), Jay-Z (``4 My (expletive)'') and\ncountless other rappers and R&B singers share space on this lengthy\nintroduction to a world as crowded with guest appearances as it is\nfun singles.\n\n   _ Sonia Murray\n\n   Doug Hamilton and Sonia Murray writes for the Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n      FOLK ROCK\n","\n   ``Restoration''\n","\n   Doria Roberts.
