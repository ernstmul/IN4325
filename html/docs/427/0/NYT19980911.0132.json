I built a picnic table of pine. What should be used to\npreserve it? Would any perservative be save for children eating off\nthe table?\n\n   JOHN ADAMS, Somerville, Mass.\n\n    \n\n   A. You could treat it with a clear sealer, which must be\nreapplied every year or two, creating an unavoidable maintenance\nsituation. Be sure to treat all surfaces, including the underside\nof the top and all legs and connectors.\n\n   But I think it'd be better to use a semitransparent stain; you\ncan get the color of your choice, it will dry well enough so it\nwill not rub off on clothing, and it will preserve the wood\nprobably better than a sealer. And, good news, it will last three\nto five years. As for safety as an eating area, it will not be a\nproblem as long as the kids don't chew it, and as long as they use\nplates. Incidental picking up of food should not be a problem.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Q. The outside flap of my exhaust fan does not close when the\nfan goes off. The fan is housed in a hood, so it opens on a\nhorizontal plane rather than a vertical plane as on a fan installed\nin a wall. My neighbors have similar ones that work well. It is a\nNu-Tone.\n\n   JOHN DONNELLY, Needham, Mass.\n\n    \n\n   A. It sounds as if the spring or other device that closed the\nflap when the fan stops is broken or gone. I would contact Nu-Tone,\nwhich has a good name in ventilation and which should be happy to\nfix it, even for a fee, to keep up its good name.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Q. I am replacing the spruce floorboards (they rotted out) with\npressure-treated boards in a 10- by 40-foot deck. I think the\njoists and other parts of the frame are OK. Should I put the new\nboards lengthwise and parallel to the house, the way the original\nboards were, or should I put them at right angles to the house, so\nI can use 10-foot boards and don't have to butt any boards\ntogether, end to end.\n\n   THEO MADDEN, Duxbury, Mass.\n\n    \n\n   A. Put them the same way as the original boards were; keep a\n3/8-inch gap where they butt end to end, over a joist. If you tried\nputting the boards at right angles to the house, you would have to\nrebuild the frame.\n\n   The only problem you might have is water staying in that joint\nwhere the boards butt end to end over a joist. In fact, that is\nwhere decay might have occurred in the frame. To get around that, I\nsuggest you lay an extra joist an inch or so away from the original\njoist, wherever boards butt end to end. That way you can have the\ngap between board ends, but the water will drip into the space\nunder the deck, preventing further decay.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Q. My house was built 15 years ago with all cedar board siding.\nIt was treated with Aquatrol preservative until it was\ndiscontinued. Now it is treated with CWF-UV. My problem is that\nsunny areas are bleached out, and shaded areas are very dark.\n\n   I would like to paint the house a cedar color to reduce\nmaintenance and have a more even color. Can I paint over the CWF-UV\nor must it be removed?\n\n   R. NORTON, Rainbow Springs, Fla.\n\n    \n\n   A. One must assume that the cedar is still in good shape, other\nthan bleaching out and darkening. For starters, check those black\nareas to see if they are mold or mildew. Put bleach on a small area\nof the black; if it turns to cedar color in five seconds or so, it\nis mold, and it must be removed. Kill it and remove it with a\nsolution of one part bleach and three parts water, then rinse. Wear\nskin and eye protection when working with bleach. If the bleach\ntest does not turn it light color, then it is weathering and\nnothing has to be done, although you might want to sand it to the\nbare cedar in order to keep the new treatment even.\n\n   I think you can prime and paint over the CWF, but I would not\nsuggest paint or primer, but rather semitransparent stain, which\nyou can get in a cedar-look color. One coat is needed, and the\nstain will last three to five years. The stain might go over the\nCWF, particularly if the CWF has weathered for a year or more. So,\ntreat a small area with the semitransparent stain; if the stain\nbeads up, stop, because it is not penetrating the wood, and you\nhave to let the CWF wear off or sand thoroughly before trying the\nstain again. And, the CWF may stay longer on protected areas such\nas under windows and eaves, so you might have to sand those areas\nanwyay.\n\n   If the cedar sucks up the stain without beading up, go ahead\nwith the stain for an even, long-lasting finish.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Q. I am putting in a used radiator to replace a smaller one in\nmy son's room. How can I clean out the used radiator? The boiler is\nonly three years old, and I am getting a lot of rusty, sludgy water\nwhen I drain the boiler.\n\n   ROB WARREN, Newton, Mass.\n\n    \n\n   A. Remove the steam valve of the used radiator and flush it with\na hose or a pressure-washer. The rusty, sludgy water is probably\nnot coming from the new boiler but from the other radiators in the\nsystem. In that case, you might try flushing all the other\nradiators.\n\n    \n\n   (Globe Handyman on Call Peter Hotton will answer reader\nquestions. Write him at the Boston Globe, Boston, Mass., 02107.
