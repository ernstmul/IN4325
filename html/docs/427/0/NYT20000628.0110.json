But Kaplan came close to\nlosing the vision in her right eye earlier this year when she was\ndiagnosed with macular degeneration, a disease that affects the\nlight-sensitive cells that line the back of the eye, known as the\nretina.\n\n   The condition affects up to 30 million people worldwide and is\nthe leading cause of blindness in the United States in adults older\nthan 60.\n\n   ``I was horrified and shocked,'' Kaplan said after learning her\ndiagnosis in April. To add to her worries, Kaplan was diagnosed\nwith ``wet'' macular degeneration, a less common form of the\ndisease affecting some 200,000 Americans.\n\n   Although no one knows what causes macular degeneration, the wet\nform tends to deteriorate the vision more rapidly than the dry. In\nboth cases, ophthalmologists have been unable to offer their\npatients much hope. ``We don't have a cure for either form of\nmacular degeneration,'' said Dr. Charles D. Mayron of the Retina\nOffice in Slingerlands, N.Y.\n\n   Physicians and senior citizens across the country have been\nkeeping abreast of Visudyne therapy, the newest treatment for wet\nmacular degeneration, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration in April. ``This is the first pharmacological\ntreatment that has proven efficacious,'' said Mayron, who has\ntreated approximately two dozen patients so far.\n\n   In clinical studies of 243 patients with wet macular\ndegeneration, vision improved or remained stable in 67 percent of\npatients treated with Visudyne, compared to 39 patients on a\nplacebo.\n\n   ``There's a high level of desperation,'' said Edmund J.\nAleksandrovich, president of the Macular Degeneration Foundation in\nSan Jose, Calif. ``People say, `if there is any chance of getting\nmy sight back, I want to do it.'''\n\n   But Visudyne, manufactured by CIBA Vision, is not a cure.\nScientists believe any such breakthrough is years away. ``It's\nsomewhat of a milestone, but nowhere like we have a solution,''\nMayron said.\n\n   Wet macular degeneration is caused by the abnormal proliferation\nof blood vessels beneath the retina. The growth of those blood\nvessels eventually damages the retina, which is that part of the\neye that enables us to read and see fine detail.\n\n   Scientists say women tend to get the disease more often, perhaps\nbecause they live longer. And people with lighter eyes tend to have\na slightly greater risk of developing the condition, according to\nDon Anderson, director of the Center for the Study of Macular\nDegeneration at the University of California in Santa Barbara.\n\n   He expects research over the next five years to reveal a\nsignificant genetic link to the disease, which is already known to\nrun in families. In the past, the only weapon against wet macular\ndegeneration was laser therapy.\n\n   But using a hot laser on the surface of the eye carried its own\nrisk. ``In the process of burning the blood vessels, we were\ndestroying the retina,'' Mayron said. ``The treatment was almost as\nworse as the disease.''\n\n   Visudyne also uses a laser, but a cold one. The treatment is\ntwo-step. First, a physician injects the drug into the bloodstream,\nwhich then binds to the abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Once\nactivated by the laser, the drug shrinks the blood vessels. But\nwhile Visudyne has helped some patients, it seems to be a temporary\nfix. The therapy, in most people, has to be repeated every three\nmonths.\n\n   And that can be expensive. A single treatment of Visudyne can\ncost as much as $1,500. Medicare, in most cases, is expected to\npick up the cost.\n\n   Kaplan believes the treatment is worth it. ``My sight is nowhere\nnear normal but it's much better than it had been,'' she said.\n``It's like a miracle.''\n\n       \n\n   (Sylvia Wood can be reached at 518-454-5445 or by electronic\nmail at swood(at)timesunion.com)\n","Headline":"\n      TREATMENT RAISES HOPE FOR SENIORS WITH RETINAL DISEASE \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Of all the losses associated with aging, Florence\nKaplan most fears losing her sight.\n","\n   ``Blindness is a terrifying, terrifying thought,'' said the\n80-year-old resident of Amsterdam, N.Y.
