Florie\nwill spend several days in the hospital and may face two more\noperations. But seven words stood out in the four-paragraph release\nfrom the Red Sox: ``the prognosis for reasonable vision is\nguarded.''\n\n   ``It's horrible, just horrible,'' said Pedro Martinez, who, when\nasked for his reaction, pounded his chest with his fist. ``I have\ntrouble talking about it. It's awful. You just pray to God that\nhe's healthy and that he can get back to being in baseball.''\n\n   Added Tim Wakefield, ``It's heartbreaking. It really is.''\n\n   Manager Jimy Williams said simply, ``I hope everything works out\nfor him physically so he won't have any further impairment.''\n\n   No one, however, was more upset than Thompson, who was not aware\nof the severity of the prognosis until after Saturday's 5-3 New\nYork victory. He had called the Red Sox clubhouse earlier in the\nday to offer his best wishes.\n\n   ``That's going to be hard for me, very hard, especially if the\nguy isn't going to be able to see,'' Thompson said. ``I don't want\nto take food off someone's table. We're all warriors and\ncompetitors, but I don't want to end somebody's career. I have a\nheart.''\n\n   The surgery, performed by Dr. Subhransu Ray at Massachusetts Eye\nand Ear Infirmary, relieved pressure in the eye.\n\n   Morgan said there also was damage to the retina, which will be\nassessed over the next two to three days to determine whether\nsurgery is needed. He said the retina was not detached, although\nthere was bleeding behind it. He also said Florie did not have\n``entrapment of the eye within the socket,'' which he characterized\nas good news.\n\n   In addition to the macular trauma, Florie also sustained three\nfractures in the eye socket area (nasal, medial wall, and socket\nfloor) that will require surgery. The timetable for those\nprocedures will be addressed in the next three to five days unless\nthere is further swelling. In that case, doctors could wait another\ntwo weeks, Morgan said.\n\n   A spokesman at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary told the\nAssociated Press that Florie was in stable condition and good\nspirits. The hospital subsequently referred all calls on Florie to\nthe Red Sox.\n\n   The news was eerily familiar to Thompson, who 10 years ago got\nhit in the face by a pitch from Russell Springer while playing in\nthe minor leagues in Dunedin, Fla.\n\n   ``I fractured my eye socket and broke my nose in seven places,''\nThompson said. ``The doctor told me my face looked like someone had\ncrushed a Ritz cracker. So I sort of know how Bryce feels. It\nwasn't very pretty. Mentally, it took me at least two years to come\nback from it. But they threw me back into the lineup a week later\nso I wouldn't be too screwed up.\n\n   ``I just wish Bryce well,'' he went on. ``When I get the chance,\nI'll give him a call.''\n\n   Florie never lost consciousness after getting hit Friday night\nand was taken off the field in a golf cart, a towel covering his\nface. He was seen briefly at the hospital that night by pitching\ncoach Joe Kerrigan, who spoke to Florie's father before the pitcher\nwent in for X-rays and surgery.\n\n   ``It was pretty bad,'' Kerrigan said. ``It was hard to look at.\nHis face was really swollen. His lips were swollen. His right eye\nwas completely shut. He could talk, but it was an effort for him.''\n\n   Kerrigan said he figured Thompson's live drive was traveling at\n110-115 miles per hour.\n\n   ``I actually saw the blood fly,'' Kerrigan said.\n\n   Before Saturday's game, Williams said he chatted briefly with\nThompson.\n\n   ``He was trying to do his job, trying to hit him hard, and\nFlorie was trying to get him out,'' said Williams. ``Then something\nlike that happens. It kind of puts things in perspective in life,\ndoesn't it?''\n\n   Friday night's appearance was the 29th of the season for Florie,\nwho had an 0-4 record and 4.56 ERA.
