Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Harriet Bass lay on a table at the New York Eye and\nEar Infirmary, her right eye propped open by a metal ring, staring\nup at a red dot of light.\n\n   ``You're going to feel a little pressure,'' Dr. John A. Seedor\ntold Bass, a 49-year-old casting director, as he was about to slice\ninto her cornea. Using a motorized blade known as a keratome,\nSeedor cut a circular flap around the cornea, about one-third of an\ninch wide and one-150th of an inch thick, and peeled it back.\n\n   Switching to a computer-controlled laser, Seedor trained an\ninvisible beam of cool ultraviolet light on the exposed soft\nunderlayers. The lenses within Bass' nearsighted eyes bent light\ntoo sharply, making her vision fuzzy. The laser vaporized bits of\ncornea in a way that flattened the curvature at the front of Bass'\neye to bring images at the back of the eye, on the retina, into\nfocus.\n\n   ``All right, Harriet. It looks beautiful,'' Seedor said. He\nplaced the flap back down, caressing it with a brush back into\nplace. ``Ready for the other eye?''\n\n   Seedor repeated the procedure. The operation took about 15\nminutes.\n\n   Although the Food and Drug Administration approved the procedure\nonly last year, Lasik, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has\nquickly grown into a $3 billion-a-year industry, with 750,000\nAmericans expected to choose the surgery this year. Intended to\ncorrect nearsightedness, the procedure can now treat farsightedness\nas well.\n\n   With 1.2 million American customers expected next year, Lasik is\nbecoming the issue in a financial turf war between ophthalmologists\nand optometrists, between top-dollar surgeons and low-cost,\nhigh-volume centers.\n\n   Ophthalmologists are the eye surgeons with medical degrees who\nperform the surgery. Optometrists are specialists in measuring\nvision who prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and,\nincreasingly, handle the care before and after Lasik surgery.\n\n   Lasik's popularity is easily explained: For the vast majority of\npatients, it is safe, effective and, increasingly, affordable.\n\n   ``It's a simple procedure,'' said Dr. Richard S. Koplin, medical\ndirector of LaserOne in Manhattan. ``It's not brain surgery.''\n\n   With so many people willing to pay out of pocket _ most\ninsurance companies do not pay for the procedure, because they\nregard it as ``cosmetic'' _ to be rid of contacts or glasses, Lasik\nsurgeons have turned to the familiar marketing tools: celebrity\ntestimonials, billboards, radio and television advertisements,\ntelemarketing.\n\n   For would-be patients, the choices _ LaserOne, Lasik Vision, the\nLaser Center, Insight Laser Center, Infinity Laser Center, among\nothers _ can bewilder.\n\n   Three general business models have evolved. Seedor is in the\nmode of a traditional practice: A patient pays for the attention\nand experience of the surgeon, $2,650 an eye in Bass' case.\n\n   Centers like Lasik Vision and LaserOne are decidedly corporate\nand mass market; Carmine Asparro of Bellmore, taking advantage of\nthe grand opening special at Lasik Vision in Garden City, N.Y.,\npaid just $500 for Lasik on his right eye. (His left already had\n20/20 vision.)\n\n   The third is an increasingly popular arrangement known as\n``co-management'' in which a patient's optometrist handles the\ninitial evaluation and postoperative care in exchange for part of\nthe fee. The Laser Center in Manhattan, for example, works with\nabout 75 optometrists who send a stream of patients. The\noptometrists make money from a procedure that eliminates the need\nfor their services.\n\n   At the Laser Center, Evan Mason of Irvington paid more than\nBass: $5,500 for two eyes. Yet she never met her surgeon, Dr. Mark\nG. Speaker, before the surgery and has not seen him since. No\nstudies have showed which approach yields better results, and all\nthree have their critics and defenders.\n\n   Marketing materials from the traditional Lasik surgeons often\ndarkly hint that their cheaper competitors might be skimping to\nmake a profit.\n\n   Dr. Joseph Dello Russo of the New Jersey Eye Institute in\nBergenfield charges $2,800 per eye. ``I know what I'm worth,'' he\nsaid. ``You're not going to get an experienced surgeon for $1,000\nan eye.''\n\n   Michael R. Henderson, president and chief executive of Lasik\nVision Corp., which runs centers in North America, is similarly\nemphatic. ``If you pay $5,000,'' he said, ``you're simply being\ngouged.''\n(MORE) nn\n\n   But Dr. Susan Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Garden City Lasik\nVision, says higher-cost surgeons can coexist with the high-volume\ncenters. In addition to her work at Lasik Vision, Fromer also\nperforms the surgery in her private practice in Manhattan, charging\n$3,600 for two eyes.\n\n   In her practice, Fromer handles the evaluation and postoperation\nvisits herself. At Lasik Vision _ which now charges $999 an eye\nafter 1,000 people quickly signed up for the introductory special _\nan optometrist on the staff handles those duties, although Fromer\nsays she reviews the optometrists' data.\n\n   ``I believe in both models,'' Fromer said. ``It's an issue of\nhandholding. The level of care is the same.''\n\n   In the co-management debates, some ophthalmologists are\nconcerned about the appearance of optometrists' steering patients\ntheir way.\n\n   Others fear that optometrists may be slow to recognize\ncomplications after operations. The Laser Center is ``an economic\nmodel,'' said Dr. Joseph Evitar, a surgeon at Chelsea Eye\nAssociates in Manhattan. ``You can't know what is really going on.\nYou're relying on someone else's judgment.''\n\n   Speaker, on the other hand, says he carefully chooses his\nco-managing optometrists. ``It wouldn't reflect well on me if I\nwere associated with someone who wasn't knowledgeable,'' he said.\nThe payment, 20 percent, is simply for the visits before and after.\n``They are entitled to be paid for their services,'' he said,\n``just like any other profession.''\n\n   Mason said she was not aware that $1,000 of the $5,000 she paid\nSpeaker was going to her optometrist, Arkady Selenow, but that did\nnot bother her. ``I trust Dr. Selenow,'' she said.\n\n   Optometrists say they know their patients better and that\nresults in better care.\n\n   ``It's not just a prescription,'' said Selenow, who practices in\nManhattan and Queens and co-manages about 1,000 Lasik cases a year.\n``It's knowing their complete lifestyle. You know if they're going\nto be happy. It's not just a science. There's an art to it, too.''\n\n   For example, he said, a person who spends lots of time reading\nor staring at a computer screen might be dissatisfied with 20/20\nvision, because up-close viewing might be uncomfortable. Leaving\nthe vision slightly nearsighted might be a better option.\n\n   With Mason, 44, Selenow steered her toward monovision, where her\nright eye was corrected to 20/20 vision, while her left eye was\nintentionally left a slightly nearsighted 20/40. That creates a\nsort of bifocal vision, with the right eye to focus on distant\nobjects and the left eye for close-up reading.\n\n   The sparring over co-management has escalated to the\nprofessional societies of ophthalmologists and optometrists.\n\n   This year, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the\nAmerican Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery released a\npaper declaring that co-management should be ``an exceptional,\nrather than a routine, occurrence,'' applicable, say, to someone\nwho lives far from the surgeon.\n\n   ``If the co-management of patients is done on a routine basis\nfor predominantly financial reasons,'' the two organizations said,\n``it represents unethical behavior and may be illegal.''\n\n   The American Optometric Association countered, ``This conclusion\nis not grounded in law, regulation, or the American Academy of\nOphthalmology's own Code of Ethics.''\n\n   Two weeks ago, the International Society of Refractive Surgeons,\nwhich includes ophthalmologists and optometrists, also said that\nco-management was acceptable and that it was developing guidelines\nfor it.\n\n   ``Properly structured, legal co-management arrangements should\nnot be cast under a pall just because they're co-management,'' said\nDr. Jeffrey B. Robin, the society's executive vice president.\n\n   While no study offers a comprehensive picture, anecdotes point\nto potential pitfalls.\n\n   Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia and\nmedical director of VISX, a laser manufacturer, tells of one\nco-managed Lasik patient referred to him.\n\n   The woman's eyesight was worsening, and an exam quickly showed\nwhy: cataracts were clouding her lenses. Her optometrist had not\nspotted the problem. The ophthalmologist did not check and, relying\non the optometrist, performed the operation. It went smoothly, but\nthe cataracts render it useless.\n\n   ``I don't fault the optometrist,'' Odrich said. ``I fault the\ndoctor who is operating on someone else's exam. You've got to do\nthe exam. This doesn't absolve you from being a doctor.''\n\n   Most Lasik patients encounter no problems at all, although 1\npercent to 10 percent require a second Lasik operation to fine-tune\ntheir prescriptions.\n\n   Still, complications do occasionally occur, some serious.\n\n   During surgery, the flap-cutting keratome might jam or create a\nwrinkle in the cornea, in perhaps one in 500 eyes, said Dr.\nJonathan Carr, director of medical services for the Lasik Vision\nchain.\n\n   After surgery, a range of problems can arise, although most can\nbe easily treated if caught promptly. About one in 500 will\nexperience an inflammation under the eye, Carr said. The odds of an\ninfection are about one in 10,000. There is one reported case of a\n35-year-old man who had one eye removed after a Lasik-induced\ninfection.\n\n   The operation also cuts down on production of tears, leading to\neyes that need drops. Almost always, the condition improves after a\nfew months.\n\n   For some, particularly those with large pupils, Lasik can result\nin nighttime glare and blurry halos around street lamps. Only\nrarely does bothersome glare persist longer than a few months, Carr\nsaid.\n\n   Other surgical alternatives exist, including corrective lenses\nimplanted in the cornea. That procedure costs about the same and is\nreversible.\n\n   In June the FDA approved a new procedure called laser thermal\nkeratoplasty for treatment of mild to moderate farsightedness in\npeople over 40. The condition affects an estimated 60 million\nAmericans. The procedure takes less than three seconds: The thermal\nlaser fires 16 bursts in two concentric rings, causing cornea\ntissue to shrink and steepening the edges.\n\n   Improvements with Lasik are expected to help extremely\nnearsighted people and those with oddly shaped corneas. For most,\nLasik already produces the results as promised.\n\n   ``I'm seeing perfect,'' Evan Mason said a couple of weeks after\nher surgery. ``It was perfect that night.'' Monovision, which she\ntested with contact lenses before her surgery, was also no problem.\n``I adapted immediately.''\n\n   Asparro, who took advantage of the special offered by Lasik\nVision, is also a satisfied patient. ``I'm so happy I did it,'' he\nsaid. ``Love it. Would recommend it to anyone.''\n\n   A couple of months after her surgery, Bass' vision is 20/50, not\nthe intended 20/25. She has bought reading glasses.\n\n   She has a second operation scheduled _ an ``enhancement'' in\nindustry parlance and included in the original cost.\n\n   ``They think they have to do me again at the beginning of\nAugust,'' she said. ``It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I\nam not a disgruntled patient by any means. I'm still satisfied with\nthe work because it's greatly improved over what I used to see.''\n","Headline":"\nLASER EYE SURGERY'S TURF WAR \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Harriet Bass lay on a table at the New York Eye and\nEar Infirmary, her right eye propped open by a metal ring, staring\nup at a red dot of light.\n","\n   ``You're going to feel a little pressure,'' Dr. John A.
