BRODY    \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   John McCain's unfortunate return bout with melanoma should serve\nas a wake-up call for the millions of Americans _ especially young\nAmericans _ who still worship the sun, skimp on sunscreen and bare\ntheir skin to UV radiation to just within the limits of decency.\n\n   It should also remind everyone of the importance of\nself-vigilance. Since no one knows your skin and its many markings\nbetter than you, you have primary responsibility for checking often\nfor any changes that could herald skin cancer.\n\n   Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer, with the\ncapacity to spread and ultimately kill. It can recur years after\ntreatment of a first melanoma, and, as seems to have happened to\nMcCain, new melanomas can develop at any time after an original\nmelanoma is seemingly cured.\n\n   Now in the United States, the incidence of melanoma is rising at\nan exponential rate: 4 percent a year for 20 years, accompanied by\nan increase of nearly 2 percent a year in melanoma deaths. One\nperson in 74 can now expect to develop melanoma at some point, up\nfrom one in 1,500 in 1935 and one in 250 two decades ago.\n\n   This year, doctors are expected to diagnosis invasive malignant\nmelanoma in 47,700 people and melanoma still in an early\nnoninvasive stage in up to 40,000 people. Melanoma will kill an\nestimated 7,700 people in this country this year, many of them in\nthe prime of life.\n\n   You see, melanoma is a cancer that afflicts the young and old. A\nquarter of new cases now occur in people younger than 40, and half\nof all cases occur in people younger than 54.\n\n   Melanoma is the leading cancer in women in their late 20s and\nsecond only to breast cancer among women in their early 30s. In\nterms of years of life lost to cancer, melanoma ranks second only\nto adult leukemia.\n\n   Have I scared you into action? I hope so. Let's start with what\nwe know about preventing this disease. Melanomas can sometimes\noccur on parts of the body like the soles of the feet and palms of\nthe hands, that are not routinely exposed to the sun. But 95\npercent of cases occur on sun-exposed parts of the body, especially\nthe head and neck, upper back and, particularly in women, the legs.\nBack in the days of long skirts, women rarely, if ever, got\nmelanoma on their legs.\n\n   Certain circumstances can render a person especially susceptible\nto melanoma. These include having suffered three or more blistering\nsunburns before age 20, repeated exposure to UV light in a tanning\nsalon, having worked three or more summers as a teen-ager at an\noutdoor job, having many moles that change in appearance, prior\ntreatment with psoralen and UV light for psoriasis and a history of\nmelanoma in a parent or sibling.\n\n   Fair-skinned people, especially those with blond or red hair,\nblue or green eyes, lots of freckles on the upper back and an\ninability to tan, are also at much greater than average risk of\ndeveloping melanoma (as well as superficial skin cancers).\n\n   People who have had several precancers of the skin (actinic\nkeratoses) are also at greater than average risk. Having three or\nmore of the above factors raises a person's risk of developing\nmelanoma 30-fold.\n\n   Bursts of sun exposure seem to be more of a problem than\ncontinuous sun. People with outdoor jobs are less likely to develop\nmelanoma than indoor workers who experience intense sun exposure on\ntheir days off.\n\n   You may have heard a report that sunscreens do not protect\nagainst melanoma. That is not entirely true. In Australia and\nHawaii, where three-quarters or more of the people now regularly\nuse sunscreen, the melanoma rate has begun to fall.\n\n   But until two years ago, most sunscreens contained agents that\nreduced the risk of sunburn from ultraviolet-B rays, which allowed\npeople to stay in the sun and remain exposed to skin-damaging\nultraviolet-A rays far longer than they otherwise might have.\n\n   The SPF (sun protection factor) rating of sunscreens refers only\nto a product's ability protect against sunburn, and most people\napply too little sunscreen too infrequently to glean anything like\nthe level of protection stated on the package. Toss out the old\nproducts and replace them with a new sunscreen that offers both\nUV-A and UV-B protection; these contain either Parsol 1789 or\nmicronized zinc or titanium oxide.\n\n   Anyway, sunscreen is considered a secondary measure to be relied\nupon when sun exposure cannot be avoided, for example, while\nswimming or playing tennis. Primary protection against sun damage\ncomes from staying out of the sun, especially at midday and wearing\nprotective clothing for prolonged exposure.\n\n   I have invested in three shirts that have sun-blocking\nproperties even when wet. They are not cheap _ about $60 or $70\neach _ but I consider them an insurance policy. I wear them while\nhiking, kayaking and snorkeling. Also available are sun-protective\nhats, pants and skirts.\n\n   When melanoma is detected and treated in its early stages, the\ncure rate approaches 100 percent (although this is no guarantee\nthat new melanomas won't develop later on). In more advanced\nstages, the fatality rate exceeds 70 percent. Regular full-body\nexaminations for signs of trouble are important for everyone, since\nmost melanomas occur in people not considered at high risk.\n\n   Self-examination for suspicious skin lesions starts with\nstripping to the buff. Then stand in a well-lighted room in front\nof a full-length mirror, using a hand mirror to facilitate views of\nyour sides, underarms, back and buttocks. Don't forget to check\nyour scalp, toes and soles of your feet. If you lack a long mirror\nor for other reasons cannot do a complete exam on your own, ask for\nhelp from a spouse, significant other or good friend.\n\n   What are you looking for? First, any lesion _ pigmented or not _\nthat seems to have changed in size or shape since your last\nself-exam. Hallmarks of an early, curable melanoma follow an\n``ABCD'' guideline: A for an asymmetrical appearance, B for an\nirregular border, C for color variations of black and light and\ndark brown (or even pink, red, white or blue) and D for a diameter\ngreater than a quarter of an inch. Some experts now add an E for\nenlargement, that is, a mole that is growing in height or width.\nLook, too, for any change in the surface or texture of a mole and\nfor changes in sensation, like itching, tenderness or pain.\n\n   Self-exams for possible skin cancer should be done monthly, and\nat the very least, every three months. If you see your doctor once\na year, have the doctor perform a full-body check as well. Report\nany suspicious lesion you find to your physician, preferably to a\ndermatologist who specializes in skin cancer. And if your doctor\nrefers you to a specialist for a more detailed exam or biopsy, act\npromptly; delaying treatment can result in a more serious and less\ncurable cancer, if that is what you have.\n\n   You may also consult an excellent book on melanoma and other\nskin cancers, ``Saving Your Skin'' by Dr. Barney Kenet and Patricia\nLawler, published in 1994.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: FORGET THE SUNTAN \n","Text":["\n   John McCain's unfortunate return bout with melanoma should serve\nas a wake-up call for the millions of Americans _ especially young\nAmericans _ who still worship the sun, skimp on sunscreen and bare\ntheir skin to UV radiation to just within the limits of decency.\n","\n   It should also remind everyone of the importance of\nself-vigilance.
