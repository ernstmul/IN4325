Cornwall is full of religious sites and monuments and other\nlittle understood curiosities that predate the Romans. This is the\nsupposed land both of King Arthur and the Druids.

An influx over\nthe remaining days is still likely.''\n\n   The weather was one problem as the main routes to Devon and\nCornwall were hit by severe downpours, in some cases causing\nflooding Saturday night and Sunday morning. The heavens may be an\nissue Wednesday as it is iffy whether it will be clear enough to\ntell if it's getting dark.\n\n   But for some local officials, the hassle of coping with\nadditional outsiders also brings on fears about the historic sites.\nMike Rosendale, an official with the Penwith district council, is\nworried about the influx of alternative groups that place special\nsignificance to the eclipse and its passage through what is seen as\na mystically rich land.\n\n   ``This area has the highest concentration of prehistoric\nmonuments in Western Europe, and the eclipse and the Millennium are\ndisaster for them,'' Rosendale said. ``They have never been under\nso much pressure, never faced this level of threat for 4,000\nyears.''\n\n   Consequently, about 30,000 acres near Penzance have been sealed\noff to protect monuments. Additional police and military forces\nwill be on alert during the week.\n\n   Andrew Norfolk, a member of the organization Pagan Federation,\nbelieves these concerns are exaggerated. Norfolk has been on the\nspeaking circuit for months warning fellow pagans to behave\nthemselves. ``It is the most important event for pagans this\ndecade,'' he said. ``The Millennium has no significance for us, but\nan eclipse sees the major symbols of paganism coming together,\nwhere masculine and feminine forces are balanced and it is a time\nfor great chance.\n\n   ``We want people to avoid lighting fires, burying things or\ndoing things with candles,'' Norfolk said.\n\n   Bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and even spare rooms are largely\nbooked up.
