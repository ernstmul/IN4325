CHANDLER  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ Why do human beings, and most other creatures on\nthis planet, have eyes that are tuned to see visible light?\n\n   Of course, ``visible'' light is, by definition, what our eyes\nsee. But it's more than just a tautological question: Why don't we\nsee infrared instead, or ultraviolet, or some other segment along\nthe spectrum of electromagnetic radiation?\n\n   Textbooks for decades have been offering up a standard answer to\nthis question, an answer with the simplicity and aptness of a\nKipling ``Just So'' story: Most of our sun's radiation is in the\nform of ``visible'' light, and our eyes evolved to tune in that\nrange of wavelengths.\n\n   It's a nice story, but about as accurate as ``How the Camel Got\nHis Hump,'' says Kenneth Brecher, a professor of physics and\nastronomy at Boston University. Brecher discovered the error when\nhe got curious about the old saw and did some fancy calculations to\ntest it.\n\n   Most of the sun's radiation, he found, is in the infrared band,\nnot the visible. So, if the long-held explanation were correct, our\neyes should have evolved to see infrared light.\n\n   Brecher presented his findings earlier this month at a meeting\nof the American Astronomical Society, in a presentation titled\n``Why don't we see in the infrared?''\n\n   If we did, our world would look very different. Trees and grass\nwould shine brightly, skies would be dark and forbidding, and our\nveins would show darkly through our skin.\n\n   Infrared would also be a very useful kind of light to see by,\nespecially in dim light, because warm-blooded creatures emit a lot\nof it, just as the sun does. Seeing in the infrared would be a\ngreat way for predators to find prey _ and for the prey to see the\npredator coming. So why don't our eyes work that way?\n\n   It may be, Brecher speculates, that there is no effective\nbiochemical system that would allow eyes to work in the infrared,\nthe way the chemistry of our eyes works for visible light.\n\n   Vision relies on molecules of a substance in the retina called\nrhodopsin. Each rhodopsin molecule can absorb photons and convert\ntheir energy into a chemical change, triggering the sensation of\nvision in the brain. But, as far as Brecher has been able to\ndetermine, there isn't a molecule around that would work the same\nway with infrared light.\n\n   The eyes of different creatures do have different peak\nsensitivities, Brecher says, extending through parts of the\n``visible'' range (some with the ability to distinguish colors and\nsome without it), and in some cases _ bees, for example _ extending\ninto the ultraviolet. But he knows of no animals whose vision is\nmost sensitive in the infrared.\n\n   Snakes do have infrared sensors that they use to help them find\nwarm-blooded prey, but this is not in any way a sense of vision. It\nis more like a sense of smell or touch, Brecher said, giving them\nonly a rough indication of direction, rather than an image.\n\n   For that matter, even plants do not take advantage of the\nmaximum energy from the sun. Chlorophyll absorbs most of its solar\nenergy from the red part of the spectrum (leaving the green light\nto be reflected), rather than from the infrared.\n\n   So, Brecher speculates, perhaps there are no chemical processes\nthat would allow eyes, or plants, to respond toinfrared _ or, if\nthere are, maybe evolution failed to discover them.\n\n   But if most of the sun's energy is in the form of infrared\nlight, how come nobody has noticed this before now? Shouldn't that\nbe a simple thing to measure?\n\n   Apparently not. Many textbooks, including some recent, widely\nused ones, repeat the old explanation.\n\n   ``Abell's Exploration of the Universe,'' a college astronomy\ntext whose most recent edition was published in 1995, says: ``It is\nsurely no coincidence, but rather a consequence of evolutionary\nadaptation, that human eyes are most sensitive to electromagnetic\nradiation at those wavelengths at which the sun puts out the most\nenergy.''\n\n   The discrepancy arose from a subtlety in how the calculations to\ndetermine the sun's peak output are done, Brecher found.\n\n   The different kinds of light, and all the rest of the spectrum\nof electromagnetic radiation that includes radio waves, x-rays, and\ngamma rays, as well as visible, ultraviolet and infrared light, are\nessentially all the same thing _ although physicists have a hard\ntime pinning down exactly what that thing is.\n\n   All these forms of electromagnetic radiation can be thought of\nas waves, vibrating with a certain wavelength (the distance from\nthe peak of one wave to the next). Or they can be thought of as\nparticles, known as photons, which are described by their frequency\n_ a number that is inversely proportional to the wavelength.\n\n   Because the two ways of measuring light are interchangeable,\nnobody worried much about which way the light was being measured.\nIt's much easier to measure directly the wavelength of light than\nits frequency, however, so that's how scientists tend to do it.\n\n   But, in this case, Brecher found, the way you measure it really\ndoes make a difference. When computed using wavelength, the sun's\npeak emission is indeed in the visible range, somewhere in the\ngreen part of the spectrum. But when computed using frequency, the\npeak comes out where it really belongs, out in the infrared.\n\n   How could this be? Part of the problem is in the way the peaks\nare figured, in one case averaging the output per unit of\nwavelength, in the other case per unit of frequency. Because the\nunits themselves change as you move along the spectrum, the size of\nthe ``bins'' in which emission is being counted changes.\n\n   It's as if you were counting how many tennis balls could be\npiled up into boxes, but the boxes were different sizes. It would\ntake more balls to fill wider boxes than to fill a narrow box to\nthe same height.\n\n   Similarly, in a wider range of wavelengths, it takes more\nphotons to bring the peak up to the same height; plotting the sun's\nemissions this way distorts the result.\n\n   Furthermore, Brecher found, frequency really is the correct way\nto do the measurement. While light can be thought of as either\nwaves or particles, depending on the circumstances, in this case it\nmakes more sense to think of particles. That's because the way the\neye responds depends on the number of photons that strike the\nretina.\n\n   It may sound like so much scientific mumbo-jumbo, but scientists\nwho listened to Brecher explain his conclusions at the astronomy\nmeeting agreed that he indeed had seen the light.\n\n   ``What he's saying there is perfectly logical,'' said Charles\nTownes, a Nobel laureate in physics and professor at the University\nof California, Berkeley. ``Our eye detects quanta,'' that is, units\nof radiation, or photons. ``His argument on wavelength versus\nfrequency is completely valid.''\n\n   Townes added that since the old explanation was wrong and it\nturns out we don't take advantage of the sun's greatest output,\nthat leaves open the question of why our eyes evolved the way they\ndid. ``We don't know enough about evolution to know for sure,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   The sun's peak radiation is not the only part of the puzzle. For\ninstance, what we often see is not direct sunlight, but light\nfiltered through clouds. And that light has a different peak.\n\n   On a cloudy day, the light we see by is much more blue.
