It has no disk\ndrives or other storage devices.\n\n   The first widespread commercial availability of the long-awaited\nnetwork computer comes three years after the device was made a\nrallying cry against Microsoft by Sun's chief executive, Scott\nMcNealy, and Oracle Corp.'s chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison. The two\nexecutives have waged war against the personal computer, which they\nargue is too expensive and complex.\n\n   Conceived as a simple and inexpensive alternative to the PC, the\nnetwork computer centralizes most of the expense and complexity of\ncomputing in the powerful servers.\n\n   The first generation of network computers from Sun and IBM, both\nbased on the Java programming language, have largely failed as PC\nprices fell. But Sun executives said Tuesday that the company had\nnot given up on its strategy.\n\n   The Sun Ray will be priced as low as $9.99 a month for a\nfive-year lease, or it can be purchased for $499. A complete system\nincluding server computers, software and monitors will be leased\nfor $30 a month for each user.\n\n   ``This is network computing 2.0,'' said Ed Zander, Sun's\npresident and chief operating officer. ``We've learned a lot in the\nlast two years.''\n\n   He said that Sun would focus on several corporate markets and\nintended to use its recently acquired Star Office business to offer\nusers PC-type productivity applications like word processing and\nspreadsheets as well as network applications like Web browsers,\ne-mail and access to corporate data bases.\n\n   Zander said it was also possible to link the system with a\nWindows NT server so that Sun Ray users could run standard Windows\napplications over the network.\n\n   Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.,\ncalled Sun Ray a smart move _ not in terms of killing Windows or\nMicrosoft's Office suite, but in increasing Sun's corporate market\nshare. He added that eventually the technology would be well suited\nto the growing number of networked homes with high-speed Internet\naccess.\n\n   The Sun Ray itself is a small box that is connected to a\nnetwork, a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard.
