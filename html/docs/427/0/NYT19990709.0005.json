By  Jim Barrero  \n!by2!Staff Writer!dlim!\n\n     !text!   CLAREMONT _ In China, a nation of 1.2 billion, it's\nestimated that only 10,000 women play soccer.\n\n   And though the immense soccer potential of the country has yet\nto be fully unleashed, China already has a huge head start on most\nof the rest of the world when it comes to success.\n\n   China will play the United States on Saturday at the Rose Bowl\nin the 1999 Women's World Cup final, and leading the way will be a\nplayer who doesn't seem to fit the typical image many have of life\nin that country. Sun Wen is a pioneer in many ways, but the\n26-year-old forward was one of soccer's elite players in recent\nyears.\n\n   This year's tournament has done nothing to dispel that notion.\nSun is tied with Brazil's Sissi for the lead in goals scored with\nseven, including two in the 5-0 semifinal victory over Norway.\n\n   Sun certainly has her admirers.\n\n   ``I've seen her over the last decade and she's playing the best\nsoccer of her life,'' said U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg. ``We\nhave tremendous respect for her.''\n\n   And respect doesn't come from only Sun's opponents but also\nteammates, fans and most others who come into contact with her\njovial personality and humble nature. Sound familiar, Mia Hamm\nfans?\n\n   But Sun is far from being the marketing icon Hamm has become. At\nthis point, her only exposure has been as part of an Adidas\ncampaign that focuses on a number of World Cup players.\n\n   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said Hamm and Sun are different players.\n\n   ``Mia's a bit faster and a bit better with the dribble,''\nDiCicco said. ``Sun Wen is an artist, finding space for herself and\ncreating space. They're both outstanding passers; they're both\nexcellent goal scorers. They're two of the best players in the\nworld.''\n\n   To place Sun in that category might seem like a stretch on the\nsurface, considering the numerous obstacles she faced in\ncultivating her game in her homeland. But the statement couldn't be\ntruer.\n\n   As rigid as the Chinese seem to be, even when it comes to\ntraining sessions and preparation for Saturday's game, Sun seems\nrelaxed _ almost at peace, if you will. She prefers to treat the\nmoment with the wide-eyed exuberance it deserves.\n\n   But her life isn't only soccer. Some of her poetry has been\npublished in newspapers, she studies Chinese literature at Shanghai\nUniversity and she loves to sing karaoke. She even belted out a\nrendition of Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind'' for a group of\nreporters earlier this week at Pomona College.\n\n   Still, Sun remembers what it has been like for most young girls\nin China who dream of playing soccer at the highest level.\n\n   ``Most fathers cannot accept girls playing soccer,'' Sun said.\n``It's the culture. Girls are supposed to be shy and studious and\nnot so active.''\n\n   But Sun said she was lucky to have a father who did not feel\nthat way.\n\n   ``My father was a real soccer fan, a former player, and he\nencouraged me to play,'' Sun said. ``I started to play when I was\n10 and started regular training when I was 13. My father is very\nproud now.''\n\n   He and an entire nation have good reason to be, with China on\nthe doorstep of an historic game Saturday.\n\n   China has been angling for revenge since losing to the U.S. 2-1\nin the gold- medal game at the '96 Summer Olympics. Sun scored the\nlone Chinese goal that day. She also scored a goal in each of\nChina's two victories against the U.S. earlier this year, including\none in the Algarve Cup final in Portugal, further signifying her\nstatus as a prime-time player.\n\n   ``She's an incredible forward and she's very good in every\naspect of her game,'' said U.S. defender Kate Sobrero, who likely\nwill draw the assignment of marking the 5-foot-4, 128-pound Sun.\n``She's a complete forward. And that says a lot.''\n\n   Norway assistant coach Jarl Torske shakes his head when asked\nabout how a team should deal with Sun. His team certainly couldn't\nin the semifinals. But Torske does have his own impressions of what\nmakes Sun shine.\n\n   ``One on one, she's a very good player,'' Torske said. ``She's\nable to turn away from her opponent and she seems to have a huge\nrepertoire. She's hard to mark because she's always moving. She's\nas close to a complete player as I've seen, and I don't think she\nhas ever been as good as this.''\n\n   Sun would prefer not to hear such talk, focusing instead on what\nher team is trying to accomplish.\n\n   ``It is very, very important that we win now,'' she said, ``for\nourselves and for China.''   !dlim!!end!     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n     !text!   CLAREMONT _ In China, a nation of 1.2 billion, it's\nestimated that only 10,000 women play soccer.\n","\n   And though the immense soccer potential of the country has yet\nto be fully unleashed, China already has a huge head start on most\nof the rest of the world when it comes to success.\n","\n   China will play the United States on Saturday at the Rose Bowl\nin the 1999 Women's World Cup final, and leading the way will be a\nplayer who doesn't seem to fit the typical image many have of life\nin that country.
