(Circuits)  \n(jt) \n By ANNE EISENBERG    \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Electronic retinal implants are not the bionic eyes of science\nfiction, the sort that Geordi on ``Star Trek'' had, but they are\ngetting closer. Work on these implants, which would be among the\nfirst marriages of computers and neurons, is progressing fast,\nresearchers say, partly because of the increasing power of computer\nchips. Such implants may start giving blind patients limited vision\nwithin a decade.\n\n   ``We have third- and fourth-generation computer chips that can\nelectrically stimulate the retina,'' said Dr. Mark Humayun, a\nretinal surgeon, biomedical engineer and professor at the Wilmer\nEye Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ``The way the\nengineering and biological testing have been going, we feel very\nconfident we'll have a prototype for human use not in 10 or 20\nyears, but in 2 to 5 years.''\n\n   Humayun and Dr. Eugene de Juan Jr. lead a group of scientists,\nsurgeons, electrophysiologists and electrical engineers, one of a\nhandful of multidisciplinary teams in the United States and Germany\nthat are working on prototypes for retinal prostheses. At least\nthree start-up companies have also formed to develop the new\nimplants.\n\n   The surviving neural tissue in the eyes of blind patients can\nrespond to electrical stimulation. When blind patients' retinas\nwere stimulated by handheld electrodes, precursors of the tiny\nsilicon chips the team hopes to implant in the future, the patients\nreported that they could see points of light, dim outlines and the\nshapes of letters, Humayun said. ``We can get patients to see a\nsimple geometric shape like a box or a letter like `H.' It's very\nencouraging.''\n\n   Humayun does not expect to replicate the complexities of natural\nvision. ``Simply providing mobility-type vision, or the ability to\ndistinguish between light and dark to patients who are completely\nblind, will have far-reaching consequences,'' he said. ``Being able\nto see the outline of a person or doorway makes a different world\nthan the world of total blackness.''\n\n   The new prostheses will work by electrically stimulating the\nmillions of neurons in the retina, a thin layer of light receptors\nand other neurons in the back of the eye. The silicon chip that\nstimulates the nerves will be placed either near the retinal layer\nwhere nerve impulses are sent to the brain, a method being\ndeveloped by the Johns Hopkins group and a group at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, or close to the\nfront-line light-detecting cells, the rods and cones, a method\ndeveloped by Dr. Alan Chow and his brother Vincent, co-founders of\nOptobionics in Wheaton, Ill.\n\n   ``Some patients are blind because of light-sensing cells that\nhave degenerated or died,'' Humayun explained. ``But the rest of\nthe retina is made of neurons that are relatively intact. Our idea\n_ and the idea of other teams in the field _ is to jump-start these\nother retinal neurons that are waiting in the dark.''\n\n   The microelectronic prostheses are designed to help the\nestimated 30 million people worldwide who suffer from two diseases\nof the retina: macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Even\nwhen the the rods and cones in these patients have died,\nresearchers say, the remaining retinal circuitry, when stimulated\nby electrical signals, is powerful enough to send signals through\nthe optic nerve.\n\n   ``In both of these diseases, the rods and cones degenerate,''\nsaid Dr. John Wyatt, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT.\nWyatt and Dr. Joseph Rizzo, a neuro-ophthalmologist at Harvard\nMedical School, lead a research group that has worked for nearly 10\nyears on a retinal implant that would stimulate the cells that\ncarry signals from the retina to the brain, the ganglion cells,\nwhich are close to the lining in the back of the eye. ``The rods\nand cones have died, but the ganglion cells that communicate\nstraight to the brain still live in substantial numbers and\napparently still work,'' Wyatt said.\n\n   Wyatt emphasized that the new devices were designed for\ndegenerative diseases of the retina and not for damage to the optic\nnerve or brain. In particular, he said the devices would not be\nhelpful for vision loss from glaucoma, in which there is damage to\nthe optic nerve.\n\n   The Harvard-MIT group plans to use at least two silicon\nmicrochips. One chip, the signal processor, will be mounted on a\npair of glasses, along with a camera. Once an image is captured, it\nwill be transmitted wirelessly to a second chip embedded in the\neye. After that chip receives the signal, it will stimulate the\nretina.\n\n   The MIT-Harvard group has not yet implanted a microchip in a\nperson but has started experiments in which the retinas of blind\npatients are stimulated with microelectrodes. Earlier this year,\nthe group implanted a microelectrode array, three millimeters wide\nand one-eighth the thickness of a human hair, in the group's third\npatient and left it in place for about three hours. The technical\nchallenges were daunting because the device had to be inserted in\nsuch a way that both it and the retina survived unharmed, Wyatt\nsaid.\n\n   The retina is delicate, ``about as strong as one layer of wet\nKleenex,'' he said. If torn, the retina will become detached from\nthe lining of the eye; if compressed, it can squeeze the blood\nvessels.\n\n   ``Right now we are only doing short-term experiments of a few\nhours in humans,'' Wyatt said. ``Presumably our patients would\ncontinue to learn if the prosthesis were left in the eye for\nmonths.'' The ability of the brain to learn and adapt over time is\nexpected to be an asset once the devices remain in place longer.\n\n   The researchers hope that electronic implants that bypass\ndamaged rods and cones in the eye may one day be as successful as\nthe cochlear implants used in the inner ear. Since the 1970s,\ncochlear implants have restored some hearing to thousands of deaf\npatients, and their ability to hear often improves over time as the\nbrain adapts.\n\n   ``In cochlear implants, patients continued to show improved word\nrecognition scores as the years passed,'' Wyatt said.\n\n   While the strategy of both the John Hopkins and Harvard-MIT\ngroups is to place the stimulation near the ganglion cells, which\nis called an epiretinal approach, Optobionics has developed a\nsilicon chip that is designed to stimulate the area near the rods\nand cones; it will need no wiring because it will be powered by\nincident light.\n\n   ``Ours is a simple silicon chip embedded with thousands of\nmicroscopic solar cells,'' said Chow, of Optobionics. ``The\nplacement of the chip underneath the retina is actually closer to\nthe remnants of the rods and cones than the epiretinal approach,\nallowing better processing of the signal by the remainder of the\nretina.''\n\n   ``We have looked at the device mostly in rabbits and rats,''\nChow said. ``The implants are biocompatible and will continue to\nfunction over long periods of time.'' Chow said he hoped to begin\nclinical trials with patients with retinitis pigmentosa within a\nyear and a half.\n\n   ``When we are satisfied with the level of safety and\nbiocompatibility, we will pull together data to submit to the Food\nand Drug Administration,'' he said.\n\n   Wyatt cautioned that many problems remained to be solved.\n\n   ``The data are encouraging, but they are not yet good enough to\njustify chronic implantation in humans.
