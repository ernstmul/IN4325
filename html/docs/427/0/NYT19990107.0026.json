Times News Service clients)  \n By BOB YOUNG  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   The Suns still may raid the Chicago Bulls, but it probably isn't\ngoing to be for forward Scottie Pippen.\n\n   Even Minnesota forward Tom Gugliotta looks like a long shot\nbased on the new collective bargaining agreement hammered out\nbetween the NBA and its players on Wednesday.\n\n   After positioning themselves for the past two years to have the\nflexibility to go after a major free agent, or maybe even two, the\nSuns are likely to find themselves severely limited by the new\ndeal.\n\n   Instead of Pippen, the Suns may only have enough money available\nunder the new rules to sign a player such as Chicago center Luc\nLongley.\n\n   But the agreement also appears to give the Suns a big advantage\nin their efforts to keep forward Antonio McDyess from defecting to\nHouston.\n\n   ``Anytime you talk about Jerry and Bryan Colangelo, you have to\nthink somehow, some way, they're going to put a team out there that\ncan compete for the championship,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said of\nthe Suns president and the general manager.\n\n   Details of the agreement are still sketchy, and Suns officials\nwould not comment.\n\n   But based on the particulars of the owners' last proposal and\ninformation gleaned from NBA sources, the Suns and other clubs that\nhoped to free up considerable salary cap space for free agents will\nhave to take another look at their blueprints.\n\n   The Suns may be better off keeping much of last season's team,\nplugging in a good big man such as Longley, adding a second-tier\nfree agent with a new salary cap exception that has been added in\nthe new deal, and then filling out the roster with young,\ndeveloping players.\n\n   The Suns have five players under contract _ Danny Manning, Jason\nKidd, Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells. Muursepp and\nWells were part of the Steve Nash deal with Dallas. They also have\na first-round draft pick, forward Pat Garrity, and a\nsecond-rounder, guard Toby Bailey, from trades. Bailey doesn't\ncount against the salary cap as a second-round pick.\n\n   The team then has several free agents that it must re-sign or\nrenounce, including three key players _ McDyess, Rex Chapman and\nClifford Robinson.\n\n   That's where it really gets tricky. All but Robinson, if not\nrenounced, count against the cap at 200 percent of their salaries\nlast season instead of 150 percent, as under the previous\nagreement.\n\n   As an example, McDyess would have counted $4.3 million against\nthe cap under the old rules. He now counts about $5.75 million\nunless he signs with another team.\n\n   The Larry Bird exception, although modified, still exists, and\nunder the new rules, the Suns are in a good position to keep\nMcDyess. As a Bird free agent, he can get a seven-year deal from\nthe Suns.\n\n   He can get only a six-year deal from Houston or any other team.\nThe Suns can give him 12.5 percent annual increases from a base\nsalary of $9 million under the new rules. Other teams can give him\nonly 10 percent increases.\n\n   Another salary cap charge that has been added is for players\nwhose rights are renounced. Assuming the Suns kept their five\ncontract players and their key free agents, and sign Garrity, they\nwould have three roster spots remaining.\n\n   If they chose to renounce their remaining free agents _ such as\nKevin Johnson, John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, Marko Milic, Horacio\nLlamas, Loren Meyer and George McCloud _ the Suns still would be\ncharged $300,000 against the cap for each remaining open roster\nspot _ a $900,000 cap charge.\n\n   Also, the projected number for this season's salary cap was\nsupposed to be $31 million. According to reports, the new number\nactually will be $30 million.\n\n   Figuring the five Suns under contract, the free agents the club\nwill try to re-sign, plus the charge for the other roster spots,\nabout $25 million of that $30 million would be eaten up.\n\n   Pippen probably wouldn't come to Phoenix for a contract that\nstarts at $5 million.\n\n   The Colangelos will have some tough decisions, especially on\nRobinson. If the club keeps him, it would eat up more cap space.\n\n   Re-signing McDyess is likely to be the top priority, but if he\nsigns elsewhere, it would more than double the available cap space,\nand the Suns likely would go after one of the other high-profile\nplayers.\n\n   The new agreement includes a new ``median'' salary exception,\nwhich starts at $1.75 million and eventually will be worth the\nleague average salary.\n\n   With almost 200 free agents available, there will be some\nbargains. A player such as the Lakers' Rick Fox or Miami's Brent\nBarry might slip through the cracks, as Robinson did before last\nseason.\n\n   Keep in mind, too, that the rest of the league is working under\nthe same restrictions the Suns now face, and the Phoenix franchise\nhas a history of being creative in these situations.\n\n   ``I'm sure Bryan has his calculator out, and he's gone through\nall the scenarios,'' Kidd said.  \n","Headline":"\nSUNS LOSE FLEXIBILITY IN DEAL  \n RULES IMPROVE ODDS OF KEEPING MCDYESS \n","Text":["\n   The Suns still may raid the Chicago Bulls, but it probably isn't\ngoing to be for forward Scottie Pippen.\n","\n   Even Minnesota forward Tom Gugliotta looks like a long shot\nbased on the new collective bargaining agreement hammered out\nbetween the NBA and its players on Wednesday.\n","\n   After positioning themselves for the past two years to have the\nflexibility to go after a major free agent, or maybe even two, the\nSuns are likely to find themselves severely limited by the new\ndeal.\n","\n   Instead of Pippen, the Suns may only have enough money available\nunder the new rules to sign a player such as Chicago center Luc\nLongley.\n","\n   But the agreement also appears to give the Suns a big advantage\nin their efforts to keep forward Antonio McDyess from defecting to\nHouston.\n","\n   ``Anytime you talk about Jerry and Bryan Colangelo, you have to\nthink somehow, some way, they're going to put a team out there that\ncan compete for the championship,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said of\nthe Suns president and the general manager.\n","\n   Details of the agreement are still sketchy, and Suns officials\nwould not comment.\n","\n   But based on the particulars of the owners' last proposal and\ninformation gleaned from NBA sources, the Suns and other clubs that\nhoped to free up considerable salary cap space for free agents will\nhave to take another look at their blueprints.\n","\n   The Suns may be better off keeping much of last season's team,\nplugging in a good big man such as Longley, adding a second-tier\nfree agent with a new salary cap exception that has been added in\nthe new deal, and then filling out the roster with young,\ndeveloping players.\n","\n   The Suns have five players under contract _ Danny Manning, Jason\nKidd, Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells.
