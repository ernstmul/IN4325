Muursepp and\nWells were part of the Steve Nash deal with Dallas. They also have\na first-round draft pick, forward Pat Garrity, and a\nsecond-rounder, guard Toby Bailey, from trades. Bailey doesn't\ncount against the salary cap as a second-round pick.\n\n   The team then has several free agents that it must re-sign or\nrenounce, including three key players _ McDyess, Rex Chapman and\nClifford Robinson.\n\n   That's where it really gets tricky. All but Robinson, if not\nrenounced, count against the cap at 200 percent of their salaries\nlast season instead of 150 percent, as under the previous\nagreement.\n\n   As an example, McDyess would have counted $4.3 million against\nthe cap under the old rules. He now counts about $5.75 million\nunless he signs with another team.\n\n   The Larry Bird exception, although modified, still exists, and\nunder the new rules, the Suns are in a good position to keep\nMcDyess. As a Bird free agent, he can get a seven-year deal from\nthe Suns.\n\n   He can get only a six-year deal from Houston or any other team.\nThe Suns can give him 12.5 percent annual increases from a base\nsalary of $9 million under the new rules. Other teams can give him\nonly 10 percent increases.\n\n   Another salary cap charge that has been added is for players\nwhose rights are renounced. Assuming the Suns kept their five\ncontract players and their key free agents, and sign Garrity, they\nwould have three roster spots remaining.\n\n   If they chose to renounce their remaining free agents _ such as\nKevin Johnson, John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, Marko Milic, Horacio\nLlamas, Loren Meyer and George McCloud _ the Suns still would be\ncharged $300,000 against the cap for each remaining open roster\nspot _ a $900,000 cap charge.\n\n   Also, the projected number for this season's salary cap was\nsupposed to be $31 million. According to reports, the new number\nactually will be $30 million.\n\n   Figuring the five Suns under contract, the free agents the club\nwill try to re-sign, plus the charge for the other roster spots,\nabout $25 million of that $30 million would be eaten up.\n\n   Pippen probably wouldn't come to Phoenix for a contract that\nstarts at $5 million.\n\n   The Colangelos will have some tough decisions, especially on\nRobinson. If the club keeps him, it would eat up more cap space.\n\n   Re-signing McDyess is likely to be the top priority, but if he\nsigns elsewhere, it would more than double the available cap space,\nand the Suns likely would go after one of the other high-profile\nplayers.\n\n   The new agreement includes a new ``median'' salary exception,\nwhich starts at $1.75 million and eventually will be worth the\nleague average salary.\n\n   With almost 200 free agents available, there will be some\nbargains. A player such as the Lakers' Rick Fox or Miami's Brent\nBarry might slip through the cracks, as Robinson did before last\nseason.\n\n   Keep in mind, too, that the rest of the league is working under\nthe same restrictions the Suns now face, and the Phoenix franchise\nhas a history of being creative in these situations.\n\n   ``I'm sure Bryan has his calculator out, and he's gone through\nall the scenarios,'' Kidd said.
