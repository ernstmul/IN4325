Times News Service   \n\n   Q. How do people get a tan?\n\n   A. Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation darkens granules\nof the pigment called melanin in the surface layers of the skin.\nPart of the radiation also stimulates pigment-producing cells,\ncalled melanocytes, in deeper layers of the skin, causing a\ndelayed-reaction tan, about three days after exposure.\n\n   When the top layers of skin wear off, so does the tan.\n\n   All adults have about 60,000 melanocytes per square inch of\nskin. Skin color is determined by how much pigment the cells make\nand what color it is; it ranges from black to light tan. Other\nfactors that stimulate melanin production include X-rays, heat,\ncertain chemicals, hormones and drugs (usually in combination with\nsun exposure) and inflammatory skin diseases.\n\n   Dermatologists warn that tanning goes hand in hand with skin\naging and a higher risk of skin cancer. Ultraviolet B, or UVB,\nradiation, the so-called burning rays, is the kind most sun\nproducts protect against. They usually offer little protection\nagainst the ultraviolet A, or UVA rays, the so-called tanning rays.\nThese are the rays that affect deeper layers of the skin, causing\nthe breakdown of supporting tissue, resulting in premature aging,\nwrinkling and a leatherlike appearance.\n\n   Some newer sun blocks protect against both kinds of radiation,\nbut nothing works as well as avoiding midday sun exposure\naltogether and wearing a hat and long sleeves.\n\n   Readers are invited to submit questions by postal mail to\nQuestions, Science Times, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street,\nNew York, N.Y. 10036-3959, or by e-mail to: Question(AT)nytimes.com\n","Headline":"\nSCIENCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \n","Text":["\n   Q.
