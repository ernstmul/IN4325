Though the sun appeared\nnormal to the untrained eye, it released a burst of gases so\npowerful that even airplane passengers near the North Pole absorbed\nunusually high radiation doses.\n\n   Six million people in Montreal, Quebec, also felt the invisible\npower of the sun that year. A solar storm disturbed the magnetic\nfield around the Earth, burning out electrical transmission\nequipment as far south as New Jersey and plunging Montreal into\ndarkness for nine hours.\n\n   ``Those poor (electric company) operators went from virtually\nquiet conditions to blackout in about 90 seconds,'' recalled John\nKappenman, a Minnesota-based consultant to the power industry.\n``There was literally nothing you could do.''\n\n   The sun may appear to be innocent and unchanging, but its\nweather is every bit as complicated _ and sometimes as dangerous _\nas Earth's. The blackouts and radiation storms of 1989 marked the\npeak of an 11-year weather cycle, a time when frequent violent\nstorms spewed great barrages of matter into space without warning,\ndisrupting anything in its path from electronic devices to animals'\nsense of direction.\n\n   Now, space weather forecasters warn that solar disruptions like\nthose of 1989 may soon return as the sun approaches another ``solar\nmaximum.'' Sometime this summer or fall, the face of the sun will\nreach a peak of dark areas called sunspots, beginning two to three\nyears of solar storms that may buffet the Earth's magnetic field\nand atmosphere, and shower space with radiation that can be\ndangerous at high altitudes.\n\n   People in the Northeast have particular reason to keep an eye on\nthe sun, both because of geography and geology. The region is\nrelatively close to the magnetic North Pole, where solar\ndisturbances often enter the Earth's atmosphere, and the granite\nbedrock below readily conducts surges of electricity. As a result,\none study found that the Northeast suffered 60 percent more\nelectrical transformer failures than the US average.\n\n   Though NASA scientists say the solar maximum this year may not\nbe as potent as the last one, society is more vulnerable to damage\ntoday because so much more technology orbits the Earth. Hundreds of\nsatellites, most of them used for telecommunications, have been\nlaunched since 1989, while construction crews are scheduled to\nbegin building the International Space Station, which will orbit\nEarth later this year.\n\n   Already, Americans have gotten a taste of what space weather can\ndo to daily life. In May 1988, 45 million pagers as well as\npay-at-the-pump gasoline station service failed when a\ntelecommunications satellite called Galaxy 4 abruptly went dead.\nThough the sun's role remains unclear, the failure of the satellite\nfollowed an unusual surge of electrons, evidence that space weather\nhastened its demise.\n\n   But the weathermen at the Space Environment Center in Colorado\nsay poor pager service is small potatoes compared to what else the\nsun can damage. In a worst-case scenario, they say solar storms\ncould knock out all high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of the\nEarth or expose airplane passengers in northern latitudes (near the\nNorth Pole) to the equivalent of 100 chest X-rays.\n\n   Space weather forecasters concede, given their limited knowledge\nabout solar weather patterns, the solar maximum could turn out to\nbe more hype than disaster. But, minimally, they say that solar max\ncould play havoc with construction of the space station by making\nspacewalks dangerous, and also cause isolated power outages and\nsatellite crashes.\n\n   ``I absolutely expect we will see episodes of days to weeks over\nthe next three or four or five years when there will be lots of\nadverse solar activity and geomagnetic storms . . . and some very\nnoticeable effects on many types of systems,'' warned Joseph\nKunches, lead forecaster of the Space Environment Center.\n\n   Not surprisingly, the growing threat of solar storms has created\na golden chance for sun researchers, who are still trying to answer\nbasic questions about how the sun works. NASA plans to launch four\nsatellites starting next month that will give them unprecedented,\nnew information, such as video of radioactive rays shooting from\nthe sun, and the shape of the Earth's magnetic field under solar\nbombardment.\n\n   ``We are going to study the solar maximum like it's never been\nstudied before,'' said George Withbroe, director of NASA's\nSun-Earth Connection Program.\n\n   Astronomers have known for millenia that the sun was not\nunchanging, instead following a predictable cycle of gaining and\nlosing sunspots. When these spots were at their peak, people on the\nground often saw the aurora borealis, the colorful Northern Lights.\nBut, until recently, few suspected the sun was responsible for\nother strange occurences _ like scrambled messages on\ntrans-Atlantic telegraph cables.\n\n   It turns out, of course, that the sun sends far more than light\nand heat across the 93 million-mile void to the Earth. The sun is\nan extraordinary furnace, putting out enough energy every second to\npower the United States for the next 9 million years, but it also\nproduces enormous burps and hiccups of charged particles and\nradiation that can reach Earth in minutes.\n\n   Anyone who watches the night sky can see the impact of solar\nweather on the heavens: The tails of comets always point away from\nthe sun as the turbulent solar wind sweeps over them. The magnetic\nfield around the Earth is similarly shaped like a teardrop,\ndetermining the magnetic forces on Earth that pull a compass needle\nto the north.\n\n   As solar winds vary _ as they do during a solar storm _ both\nmagnetism and the behavior of electricity on Earth can change. The\naurora borealis, for example, occurs as charged solar particles\nbuild up inside the ``tail'' of the magnetic field, creating\nstreams of white, red and yellow light as they race to Earth at 300\nmiles per second.\n\n   But the effect of a solar storm can, on the other hand, be quite\nserious, bringing harmful radioactive gamma rays to the upper\natmosphere, or causing electrical surges through the ground that\ncan burn out power transmission equipment. In addition, they can\nbombard satellites with particles, something that hastened the\ncrash of the Skylab space station in the 1970s.\n\n   Though solar storms can come anytime, they are much more likely\nto occur during the solar maximum when there are more sunspots,\nrelatively cool spots that can be launching pads for radioactive\ngas explosions called solar flares. In addition, sunspots often\nforeshadow other storms, such as coronal mass ejections that\nrelease a billion tons of matter into space.\n\n   However, space weather forecasters admit their knowledge is too\ncrude to predict exactly when the Earth will feel the effects of\nthe solar max. So far, in fact, the uptick in sunspots has had\nrelatively little effect on Earth, perhaps because solar particles\nhave simply gone in other directions.\n\n   ``One funny thing about predicting solar activity is some people\nactually expect you to get it right,'' said David Hathaway, a\nresearcher at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, who\nhad expected more geomagnetic storms by now.\n\n   As a result, a wide array of space-sensitive businesses must\nkeep track of space weather.
