Times News Service   \n\n   In the summer of 1996, a supervisor at a soft-drink factory in\nGhana, West Africa, angered some of the men working under him, and\nduring the fight that followed, lye was thrown in his eyes.\n\n   Normally, his vision would be declared an irreparable loss, and\ndoctors would not attempt treatment.\n\n   His corneas, the windows over the pupil, had turned thick, white\nand opaque. The globe of each eye had lost its fluid and deflated\nlike a limp balloon to less than half size. And the man's eyelids\nhad fused together.\n\n   But in recent years, after the pioneering work of Dr. Relya\nZivojnovic in Belgium, surgery has brought back sight to people\nwith more and more extreme injuries. And now, according to a report\nin last month's issue of Archives of Ophthalmology, the man from\nGhana has had vision restored to 20/60 in his right eye.\n\n   ``This is tremendously interesting,'' said Dr. Halal Lewis,\ndirector of the Eye Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ``It\nsuggests that maybe some eyes that we thought would continue to\ndeteriorate can be saved, at least temporarily.''\n\n   Once a loss of pressure inside the eye has occurred, the eye\nusually deteriorates steadily into complete collapse. But in the\ncase of the man from Ghana, that has not happened, though his\ndoctors are not sure why. And by using an artificial cornea, Dr.\nClaes Dohlman at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary was able\nto restore vision to the patient's eye.\n\n   Dr. John D. Gottsch, of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns\nHopkins Medical Center, noted: ``Eyes in as bad shape as this are\ngenerally written off as hopeless. But this work by Dr. Dohlman is\nvery encouraging; it may teach us that even eyes like these have\nthe potential to see again.''\n\n   In the case of the Ghanaian man, Dohlman believed that enough of\nthe eye was still working _ the retina was intact and the glands\nthat make fluid in the eye were not completely lost _ that a\ntransplant might work. He used a clear plastic cornea to replace\nthe injured one. Because of the extensive tissue damage, he first\nhad to sew a patch of healthy eye tissue to the plastic cornea, and\nthen he transplanted both together onto the man's eye.\n\n   The operation occurred in 1997, and the man's eye has retained\ngood vision for more than a year. It is not yet clear whether his\ngood vision will continue or deteriorate again over time.\n\n   It is not known how many cases of injury leading ultimately to\ncomplete collapse of the eye occur in the United States, but\nresearchers say the number is in the thousands.\n\n   And they say that the case of the man from Ghana suggests that\nsome people now counted as untreatable may be able to have vision\nrestored for a time.\n","Headline":"\nCASE OFFERS NEW HOPE FOR SAVING INJURED EYES \n","Text":["\n   In the summer of 1996, a supervisor at a soft-drink factory in\nGhana, West Africa, angered some of the men working under him, and\nduring the fight that followed, lye was thrown in his eyes.\n","\n   Normally, his vision would be declared an irreparable loss, and\ndoctors would not attempt treatment.\n","\n   His corneas, the windows over the pupil, had turned thick, white\nand opaque.
