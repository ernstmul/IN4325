Hey, I'm only out 17\ncents per buck, right? I blame myself for that one. But I blame all\nmy genius friends who boast of their NASDAQ stock runups for my\nother biggest miss. How was I to know the technology-drenched\nmarket index would run up 84 percent on the year to yesterday? Do I\nknow a lot of smart people? Yes.

Did Clinton ever do anything right? Not according to\nhis enemies, who are legion, and largely much more prosperous than\nthey ever dreamed of being, thanks to Clinton's eerie feel for what\nshould be done to keep this jalopy turning over at the elevated rpm\nrate we've come to expect.\n\n   What else happened as we scroll back through the century's\nrearview mirror? We've seen the rise of the Internet, as no one\nlets us forget for a nanosecond. We've seen the decline of Congress\nas an institution. The turnover of the Panama Canal to the\nPanamanians _ that's a country we invented in order to swipe the\ncanal route from Columbia _ had to be ratified by the US Senate in\nthe Jimmy Carter era, and it passed, with enough Republican\nsupport, because we used to have a bipartisan consensus on foreign\npolicy, all through the century, up to the Reagan presidency.\n\n   The off-year elections of '78 saw the heavily financed right\nwing outfits target and defeat five liberal Democratic senators,\nusing all sorts of wedge issues and red-baiting. The Senate became\na more hostile environment after that bit of business involving the\nreligious right and the anti-environmentalists of the Sagebrush\nRebellion.\n\n   It went downhill a lot faster with Reagan's election in 1980,\nand pitched straight down with the Gingrich Revolt of '94. When\nNewt's Marauders took over the House, Congress became a toxic waste\ndump. Dozens of veterans began parading out into retirement, rather\nthan face the petty irritations thrown up by the conservative\nfundamentalists. Shutting down the government twice over\nnow-forgotten wrinkles in the perennial budget wrangles represented\nthe highwater mark _ or lowwater mark _ of the political tide.\n\n   But the radioactive residue of the Newt era lingers on. The\nSenate's refusal to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty, and the\nHouse's refusal to vote symbolic support of America's fighting\nforces while the Kosovo air war was underway, were two examples of\nhow badly ruptured is the US Congress these days.\n\n   The conservatives are not far off when they repeat their mantra\nthat ``Reagan won.'' Government has been widely discredited as an\nagent of positive change.
