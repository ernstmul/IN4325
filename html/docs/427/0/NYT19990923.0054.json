He can drive a car, play video games, watch TV. He\ncan even take fly balls and batting practice.\n\n   But when the sun goes down and the night deepens, he cannot see\nwell enough to hit a major-league slider or pick up a line drive\ncoming off the bat.\n\n   The Texas Rangers' starting left fielder was on the bench\nWednesday night instead of playing against the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n   ``Really, there's nothing that can be done until whatever's in\nmy eye goes away,'' Greer said.\n\n   He saw ophthalmologist Dr. David Kleiman and retina specialist\nDr. David Callanan on Wednesday, and after a series of tests they\ndiagnosed his ailment as a bruised retina.\n\n   ``There's no abnormalities,'' said trainer Danny Wheat, who got\nthe news from the doctors. ``It's just a bruised retina.''\n\n   That's the good news.\n\n   The injury that occurred when he walked into the path of a ball\nthrown by Rangers pitcher Rick Helling on Sept. 13 and caused him\nto miss six games, and that caused him to leave Tuesday's game\nbefore the fifth inning because he had trouble focusing on the ball\nafter the sun went down, isn't career threatening. When the bruise\nis completely gone Greer's eyesight will be back to normal and\nhe'll be in the lineup. It could happen Friday, when the Rangers\nopen an important three-game series against the Oakland Athletics.\n\n   The bad news is it could take two weeks. Or more.\n\n   ``There is no way to put a timetable on it,'' Rangers manager\nJohnny Oates said.\n\n   The diagnosis relieved Greer's fears that he might have suffered\npermanent damage. It did nothing for the frustration quotient.\n\n   ``The frustration level rises each time I close my right eye to\nsee what my left is doing,'' Greer said. ``It's almost like a\ncamera that's out of focus, and you have to turn it to focus it. It\nmight take half a second, or it might take two seconds. I have to\nreally concentrate on what I'm looking at to make it come clear.''\n\n   Greer has had physical injuries before, a strained left oblique\nmuscle, a sprained left shoulder, a cracked rib, various bumps and\nbruises and muscle pulls and twinges common to professional\nathletes. The healing process for most of those could be hastened\nwith rehabilitation exercises.\n\n   But there's nothing that can be done to speed up the recovery\nfrom an eye injury.\n\n   ``I've gone out and played hurt, with a hurt ankle, a hurt\nhamstring, a hurt back, and I know what pain feels like,'' Greer\nsaid. ``But I've never had eye problems. I don't know what\npercentage I'm at. But I would think anything less 100 percent with\nyour eyes is not good.'' \\Ntagtop:Simon Gonzalez, (817) 390-7760\n\\Ntagbottom:gonzalez\\Nstar-telegram.com\n","Headline":"\nGREER TO SIT OUT AS RETINA BRUISE HEALS\n","Text":["\n   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rusty Greer can live, as he put it, a\n``normal life.''
