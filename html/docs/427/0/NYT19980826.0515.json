There won't\nbe a total on damage for weeks.''\n\n   She said the best ``guesstimate'' Wednesday was that the storm\nwould lay siege to North Carolina for 36 hours. ``But Bonnie has\nbeen an unpredictable storm,'' she added.\n\n   No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the massive\nstorm did a lot of damage in Brunswick County, especially along\nHolden Beach and Caswell Beach. Winds ripped a roof off\nColumbia-Brunswick Hospital, caused extensive flooding and knocked\ndown trees.\n\n   The hurricane had wiped out electricity to more than 200,000\nhomes in North Carolina and 80,000 more in South Carolina.\n\n   Five people took refuge from the brunt of the storm in a\nhistoric Bald Head Island lighthouse. They went back to their homes\nlater Wednesday.\n\n   In Wilmington, wind gusts bent trees sideways, and torrential\nrain came in stinging, horizontal sheets. A salt spray smell hung\nin the air. Broken tree limbs and downed power lines littered some\nareas of the city.\n\n   The hurricane _ the third to hit Wilmington in two years _\nsurged ashore Wednesday afternoon at the Cape Fear River.\n\n   The storm was expected to continue pushing slowly northward\nthrough North Carolina throughout Wednesday night.\n\n   Roy Gillikin was waiting for Bonnie in its full form in\nBeaufort, N.C., and he knew enough about hurricanes to joke that it\nhelped to have a small brain or a large bottle to ride one out.\n\n   ``I was born and raised down here, and I've been through a lot\nof them, and none have been pleasant,'' he said, weathering Bonnie\nout in this town just south of the Cape Lookout National Seashore.\n``This one is just going to be long. It's not the meanest one we've\never had.''\n\n   The storm followed a similar course to Bertha and Fran,\nhurricanes that punished eastern North Carolina in July and\nSeptember 1996. Bonnie slowed as it passed near Wilmington,\nspurring predictions that the huge storm would hurl sustained winds\nand tidal surges throughout today as it plodded northward.\n\n   ``It is just going on forever and forever,'' said Bruce\nWilliams, New Hanover County's agricultural extension director.\n\n   Nearly 500,000 people were ordered off North Carolina's coastal\nislands and out of South Carolina's two northernmost coastal\ncounties ahead of the storm Tuesday.\n\n   ``After Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bertha, I think people are\nbeginning to pay more attention to hurricane watches and\nwarnings,'' said Henry, the spokeswoman for the North Carolina\nEmergency Management Agency.\n\n   Three critical-care patients and a mother and her premature baby\nat Columbia Brunswick Hospital in Supply were transferred Wednesday\nafternoon to Grand Strand Hospital in Myrtle Beach after wind blew\noff a section of roof of the Brunswick County hospital.\n\n   ``The wind got under one corner of the roof and lifted it off,''\nBrunswick County spokesman Huey Marshall said. He described the\nsection of roof as the ''size of a golf cart.''\n\n   The damage occurred near the hospital's electrical supply boxes,\nso administrators were planning to close the hospital and transfer\npatients to other facilities, Marshall said.\n\n   Amid gusts that reached 110 mph, five Bald Head Island residents\nleft their homes Wednesday and broke into ``Old Baldy,'' a\nlighthouse built in 1817. Another 42 people remained on the resort\nisland at the mouth of the Cape Fear Island, village manager Wade\nHorne said.\n\n   Horne said there were reports of minimal damage to homes and\nsome trees down.\n\n   One Bald Head homeowner reported to Horne that he planned to\ntake his dog for a walk when he saw the sun come out during the\npassing of the storm's eye.\n\n   ''There was no major overwash and no infrastructure damage,''\nsaid Horne, who had left Tuesday night. Despite an evacuation order\nthat required vacationers to leave and urged residents to do so,\nHorne said, some residents claimed they were left behind by Bald\nHead's boats.\n\n   ''There are certain people on the island who would like to\nportray that we left them,'' he said. ''We did not intentionally\nleave people.''\n\n   Elsewhere in Brunswick County, the storm blew the roof off a\nbank on Sunset Beach, and a tidal surge washed over the two-lane\nroad at Caswell Beach.\n\n   Trees fell on several homes in Calabash, a fishing village near\nthe South Carolina line. Tumbled trees knocked out electricity in\nrural areas, although county officials couldn't provide an estimate\nof how many residents lost power.\n\n   Carteret County officials reported the storm blew away a roughly\n60-foot section of Iron Steamer Pier at Pine Knoll Shores, a\ncommunity between Atlantic Beach and Emerald Isle.\n\n   It was the sheer width of the storm that astounded Gillikin up\nin Beaufort, which he said has historically been sheltered by\nbarrier islands from the brunt of storms.\n\n   ``I've never heard of one this big. It's 140 miles from the eye\nto the outside of the hurricane,'' he said. ``A 140 miles as the\ncrow flies is from here to Raleigh on both sides of the eye.''\n\n   North Carolina officials prepared for the worst. Gov. Jim Hunt\nhad already requested federal disaster relief from President\nClinton and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose Atlanta\noffice would evaluate the request, Henry said.\n\n   Carolina Power and Light Co. had 2,100 line and service workers\nstaged in inland cities like Raleigh and Florence, S.C., ready to\ngo to work once Bonnie did its damage.\n\n   Spokesman Mike Hughes said an additional 600 linemen were\nexpected to arrive from Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama on\nWednesday. ElectriCities _ a confederation of municipal power\nsystems in the state _ said it also had crews from Tennessee,\nGeorgia, Virginia and South Carolina on standby.\n\n   Other states were helping out with the basics. Ten truckloads of\nice were on the way from Ohio, 10 truckloads of water were coming\nfrom New York and a convoy of ``comfort stations'' was motoring\nfrom Texas. The comfort stations include ice and water trucks and a\nrest room truck.\n\n   The state prisons had convicts lined up to help clear roads and\ndebris, as they did after Bertha and Fran.\n\n   Officials in several towns and counties near Wilmington were\ntaking precautions against any looting even before the hurricane\nhit. Carolina Beach officials enacted a curfew effective at 10:30\na.m. Wednesday. The curfew prevents anyone except for emergency\npersonnel from roaming the town. Kure Beach ordered a curfew\neffective at 11:30 a.m. A countywide curfew was ordered for Pender\nCounty from 9 p.m. Wednesday until 6 a.m. today.\n\n   While emergency management officials warned the slow storm would\nprobably dump dumpsters of rain, North Carolina Agricultural\nCommissioner Jim Graham said the state was much drier than it was\nbefore Hurricane Fran and the low-water levels should avert some\nflooding and associated pollution problems. The coast is the center\nfor the state's pork industry with nine million hogs, already in a\nwhirlwind of controversy because of pollution.\n\n   ``As dry as it's been, I don't expect any (animal waste) lagoons\nto overflow,'' Graham said. ``Bring the rain on. We can use it. ...\nBut we don't need it beating us on the head. The good Lord's\nshining on us this time.''\n\n   Graham said much of the tobacco crop already has been harvested,\nbut corn, soybeans and cotton are vulnerable because harvesting has\nnot yet started.\n\n   Other officials were more worried about flooding. Richard Moore,\nNorth Carolina's secretary of public safety, expressed concern\nabout strong winds raising water levels in the northeast sounds by\n9 to 11 feet.\n\n   ``We're not talking about one burst of water, like a tidal\nwave,'' he said. ``We're talking about the water being backed up in\nour sounds by the winds for as long as the hurricane lingers.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   MOREHEAD CITY, N.C. -- Hurricane Bonnie continued to batter the\nNorth Carolina coast Wednesday night after rumbling ashore at Cape\nFear at the southern end of the state.\n","\n   The extremely wide storm slowed to a forward crawl of 6 mph,\nallowing 115 mph winds to pummel the historic city of Wilmington,\nsaid Cathy Henry, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Emergency\nManagement Agency.\n","\n   ``It's sort of like stalled,'' she said early in the evening.\n``Our coast is being pounded by hurricane-force winds.
