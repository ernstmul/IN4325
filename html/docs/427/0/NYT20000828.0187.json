Light skin absorbs lots\nof UV, while dark skin absorbs less.\n\n   UV light, which affects the skin's production of important\nbiochemicals, is both good and bad: Exposure to too little UV means\nthe skin doesn't generate enough of these chemicals, some of which\nenhance one's chances of successful reproduction, while too much UV\nrisks destroying those same chemicals or triggering skin cancers.\n\n   The research shows that evolution modifies skin colors to adjust\nto the regional intensity of UV light. This helps the body strike a\nreproductively healthy balance between the extremes of too much UV\nand too little UV.\n\n   Measurements by the Total Ozone Spectrometer satellite run by\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration support Jablonski\nand Chaplin's thesis. As humans have migrated around the globe,\nevolution has altered their skin color with extraordinary subtlety\nto match local levels of solar UV, technically known as UV\n``flux.'' Solar UV varies from place to place because of latitude,\nhumidity, cloudiness and other factors.\n\n   Evolution adjusts skin color to regional UV levels to boost the\nchances of reproductive success, according to Jablonski, an\nanthropologist, and Chaplin, a geographic information systems\nconsultant.\n\n   UV affects the likelihood of reproduction by influencing bodily\nproduction of two bio-molecules vital for healthy offspring: folate\nand vitamin D-3. The findings are reported in the July issue of the\nJournal of Human Evolution.\n\n   Folate, considered part of the B vitamin complex, occurs\nnaturally in many foods, and is found in highest concentrations in\ngreen, leafy vegetables, beans and grain. It is essential for\nproper development of the nervous system in fetuses and for sperm\nproduction in adult males.\n\n   Vitamin D-3 helps build and maintain strong bones and an alert\nimmune system, particularly in fast-growing human embryos.\n\n   The hypothesis may also explain why human females tend to be\nslightly lighter skinned than males. Light skin admits more solar\nultraviolet light, enhancing female production of vitamin D-3\nneeded to support fetal growth during pregnancy, and to nourish a\nnewborn via breast feeding.\n\n   C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University\nof Michigan, said the paper written by Jablonski and Chaplin is\n``an excellent piece of work . . . a marvelous survey.''\n\n   Although Brace has technical reservations about certain aspects\nof the paper, all in all ``I don't think you're going to find a\nskeptic.''\n\n   Jablonski, 46, received her doctorate at the University of\nWashington in 1981. Chaplin, 46, is her husband and a specialist in\ngeographic information systems (GIS), which are computer systems\nfor the analysis and visualization of geographic data.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   For centuries, scientists have debated the cause of differences\nin human skin color. They have long known that skin lightness and\ndarkness vary with skin levels of melanin, a large organic\nmolecule. The more melanin in your skin, the darker it is.\n\n   The melanin levels in a newborn's skin are genetic: For example,\ndark-skinned people are more likely to give birth to dark-skinned\nchildren.\n\n   But why do melanin levels vary so dramatically from one human\npopulation group to another?\n\n   ``For a long time,'' Jablonski said in a telephone interview,\n``scientists have thought that skin color varies from place to\nplace to balance out the advantages and disadvantages of local\nvariations in solar UV light. On the one hand, UV stimulates the\nproduction of vitamin D in the skin; on the other hand, too much UV\ncan cause skin cancer.\n\n   ``But this explanation was considered weak by some scientists\nbecause skin cancer has little or no effect on people's ability to\nreproduce, which is really the bottom line of every evolutionary\nspreadsheet.''\n\n   The research provided what Jablonski called strong evidence for\nthe old thesis about UV light and skin color.
