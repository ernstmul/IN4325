The scientists are Tom Slanger and\nDavid Huestis, both chemists who specialize in aeronomy, the study\nof the upper atmosphere.\n\n   The ashen light is an elusive luminescence, sometimes faintly\nvisible on the dark side of Venus.

Each\ncarbon dioxide molecule consists of one atom of carbon and two of\noxygen. The intense UV light splits a COel,4 2el,-4 molecule into\nCO (carbon monoxide, like the poison gas from cars) and single\noxygen atoms.\n\n   Then high-altitude Venusian winds blow the CO and O atoms to the\nfar, unlit side of the planet. This happens quickly, because\nVenusian winds blow incredibly fast, far faster than the planet\nbelow rotates, thanks to a still-somewhat-mysterious process known\nas ``superrotation.''\n\n   On the dark side, the lone oxygen atoms recombine into molecular\noxygen, that is, Oel,4 2el,-4 . As they recombine, they emit light.\n\n   Hence the continual recombination of oxygen atoms into Oel,4\n2el,-4 molecules creates a continual faint glow, a visual chorus of\naerial light. Sometimes the light is barely enough to be seen\nthrough earthly telescopes.\n\n   A related process creates the airglow in Earth's atmosphere,\nHuestis says. In the upper atmosphere of Earth, UV light splits\nOel,4 2el,-4 molecules into separate oxygen atoms. These then\nrecombine, emitting light.\n\n   Terrestrial airglow is typically much too faint to be seen with\nthe naked eye, especially in or near cities, where electric\nlighting _ ``light pollution,'' as astronomers call it _ washes out\nmuch of the night sky.\n\n   Huestis says Earth's airglow is ``about one-fourth as bright as\nthe Milky Way (galaxy).''\n\n   A Web site showing space shuttle photos of terrestrial airglow,\nas viewed from Earth orbit, is at\nhttp://plasma2.ssl.berkeley.edu/atmos/wave.html.\n\n   The oxygen explanation of the Venusian airglow was first\nsuggested in the mid-1970s. That was during the Cold War, when\nU.S.-Soviet space competition spurred the Russians to launch\nnumerous robotic spaceships toward Venus.\n\n   In 1975, two Russian space probes orbited Venus and used\nspectrometers to analyze its atmospheric composition, which is\nmostly carbon dioxide. The sensors detected the Venusian airglow;\nfurther analysis of the images identified it as glowing atmospheric\noxygen.\n\n   Now, Slanger and Huestis hope to obtain more refined\nmeasurements by using the giant Keck telescope in Hawaii. It's\nperched atop an extinct volcano on the big island of Hawaii.\n\n   The Keck is so powerful, with its 33-foot-wide mirror, that it\ncan see the Venusian atmosphere more distinctly than did the\nRussian space probes, which flew past the planet.\n\n   ``The spectral resolution of the Russian (observations) is more\nthan 100 times worse than Keck can do,'' Slanger said.\n\n   The scientists also plan to use the Keck telescope to try to\ndetect airglow on the dark side of Mars, the fourth planet from the\nsun (Earth is third), starting in the spring of 2001.
