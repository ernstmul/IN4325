Madonna, Sharon Stone and\nKim Basinger, among others, are preserving their beauty by\ncarefully protecting their skin.\n\n   How, once and for all, do you really protect yourself against\nthe sun?\n\n   Ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B rays are the sun's harmful rays,\nthe ones that cause skin cancer and premature wrinkling, and you\ncan't look for them, because they're invisible. They emanate\ndirectly from the sun, they're reflected from water, sand and snow,\nand they're a threat even on cloudy summer days.\n\n   In other words, you can attract rays and harm your skin simply\nby sitting unprotected under a beach umbrella. To protect\nthemselves, many people follow the conventional wisdom that says a\nsunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 will screen out\nthese harmful rays.\n\n   The trouble with sunscreen lotions, however, is that they do\njust that: screen the sun. They cannot effectively provide a\nbarricade any more than a window screen will keep out a breeze.\n\n   For true protection, what you want instead is a sunblock, the\nonly true barrier against the sun. Read the label. If a sunblock\ncontains either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, it's a sunblock\nthat will effectively block the sun. If it doesn't, it won't.\n\n   Sunblocks have come a long way since the white pastes that you\nused to see plastered over lifeguards' noses. Today, the better\nbrands blend into the skin, look natural, and provide great\ncoverage--all the criteria you need.\n\n   For best results, apply a thin layer carefully, using a makeup\nsponge to blend. (Important: don't forget to apply carefully to the\nbacks of your hands, one of the first places to reveal those age\nspots caused by the sun.) Reapply, in general, every couple of\nhours you're out in the sun, and definitely after swimming or\nperspiring heavily, after gardening, say, or tennis.\n\n   Among the great brands available at most drugstores are Bain de\nSoleil's All Day Waterproof, Johnson & Johnson Sundown, Blockout by\nVaseline Intensive Care, A-FIL cream total block and Oil of Olay\nDily UV Protectant Beauty Fluid, which has an SPF of 15, contains\ntitanium dioxide, and is also a moisturizer.\n\n   You can use the same sunblock on both face and body, although I\nmyself prefer to use the heavier blocks on the body, and the\nlighter cosmetic blocks like Oil of Olay on the face.\n\n   In addition, you'll want to ``accessorize'' for the sun. Sun\nvisors in vibrant colors are a protective must for playing tennis,\nbiking, gardening. J. Peterman makes a great Panama hat; the\n``Gauguin'' model, very wide and floppy, is available by calling\n1-800-231-7341.\n\n   Any tightly woven, oversized cotton shirt will deflect the sun\nsome, but Travel Smith catalog (1-800-950-1600) offers terrific\n``air conditioned'' protective shirts for both men and women.\nThey're lightweight and cool enough for swimming in. (Be sure to\ntie at the waist first, for a sleek look.)\n\n   Any tightly woven cotton shirt worn at the beach protects--and\npresents a classic Katherine Hepburn image. Turn up the collar to\nprotect your neck, and leave the cuffs long to protect your hands.\n   Help for Hair     \n\n   You can also protect your hair before going to the beach by\nusing a hot oil treatment such as Alberto VO5, sold in any\ndrugstore, or the Super Luxurious Intense Hydrating Oil Treatment\nby Phytogie.\n\n   A home alternative is a 20-minute application of warmed\nvegetable or olive oil, washing well afterward since these oils\naren't water soluble. With any treatment, be sure to wrap a hot\ntowel over your head to keep the heat in.\n\n   For further protection, Phytogie also offers a fabulous product\ncalled Sun Protection Oil, which does just that. Apply before\nsunning or swimming. And where a hat whenever you can.\n\n   The trick is to dress as carefully for the sun--summer and\nwinter--as you would for the bitter cold. And start your children\non the same thoughtful sun-protective regimen as soon as they're\nexposed. You can definitely have your sun, as long as you protect\nyourself against it, too.   \n   (Gale Hayman is the author of ``How Do I Look?'' and co-founder of\nthe Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills.)     \n\n   ---------\n\n   SIDEBAR: SUMMER MAKEUP\n\n   To layer makeup for summer, always start by applying your sun\nblock first--even if your makeup has an SPF factor. Apply it on\nclean, dry skin, and give it ample time to let it dry.\n\n   The next layer is your moisturizer. If your skin is oily to\nbegin with, it will be oilier in the summer, so one trick is to\ndilute your foundation with your moisturizer for a lighter feel.\nDry skin needs its own layer of moisturizer, always.\n\n   Next curl your eyelashes with an old-fashioned eyelash curler\nfrom the drugstore, whether or not you're planning to wear mascara.\nThis will open up your eyes, actually lift the face, and it's a\nstep far too many women skip.\n\n   (Another way to make your eyes look bigger is to apply a dot of\nconcealer in the corner of the eye socket and pat it in, which\nbrings the eye out where otherwise it tends to recede.)\n\n   To create your own bronzing makeup, test your favorite\nfoundation in a shade three or four times deeper than your natural\ncolor, blending it well with a damp makeup sponge. Blending is\nkey--be sure to ease the sponge into hairline, chin, neck, and--as\nthe pros do in Southern California--over the earlobes; white\nearlobes against a glowing face are a giveaway every time!\n\n   If you choose to go with a bronzer, they're available in powder\nform or, my favorite, creme powder form, which is applied with a\ndamp sponge just like foundation and covers quickly and well. (The\npowders are applied like blush, with a big fat brush all over the\nface, under the chin, and over the eyelids.) Choose a tone that's\nneither too red nor too orange, and apply it in bright natural\nlight to check the color.\n\n   As for lip color, start by defining the lips with a nude-colored\nlip pencil. For a natural look, fill in the lips with the same\npencil, then add a touch of lip gloss--long lasting and utterly\ncarefree. For a dressier occasion, go with brighter lip color, a\nlight, clear red, pink, or coral offsets a golden tan beautifully,\neven if it's a tan from a bottle. --Gale Hayman\n   (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not\nprohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative\nCONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or\nby fax at 816-822-1444.)   \n   (She also has information on how to subscribe to LifeBeat, a weekly\npackage of five intriguing articles with color art.)  \n","Headline":"\nSAVE YOUR OWN SKIN \n","Text":["\n   Look around at the stars today who have paid attention to the\nwarnings about overexposure to the sun.
