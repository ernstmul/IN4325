If Californian researchers are right, then\nincreased ultraviolet radiation is having scarcely any effect on\nthe growth of marine plankton, the base of the ocean's food chain.\n\n   The team, led by Kevin Arrigo of Stanford University in Palo\nAlto, Calif. has created computer models of phytoplankton growth\nover a year in the southern hemisphere before and after the ozone\nhole appeared in the 1980s. They included such factors as the\nposition of the ozone hole, cloud cover, and UV-B strength _ the\ntype of ultraviolet radiation that increases as atmospheric ozone\ndeclines.\n\n   To find out what increased UV-B did to phytoplankton, the\nresearchers compared two models. One was based on data from 1992, a\nyear with a yawning ozone hole and the other with the same\nparameters except for the ozone levels, which were taken from 1978,\na year of ``normal'' conditions before the hole appeared.\n\n   Over the southern hemisphere ecosystem as a whole, they found\nthat primary phytoplankton production decreased by only about 1\npercent in 1992, which is significantly lower than other estimates.\n\n   Arrigo's work does not discount the results of a number of\nstudies showing that increased UV-B can stunt phytoplankton growth\nby 10 percent or more in localized areas or in the laboratory. The\ndifference is that his study looked at the big picture of UV-B for\nthe whole ocean.\n\n   In previous studies, researchers scaled up measurements of\nplankton growth beneath the hole and elsewhere to calculate an\noverall effect for the whole Southern Ocean. But although they knew\nthat factors such as cloud cover were important, they are difficult\nto include in such calculations.\n\n   ``On a cloudy day under a deep hole, there's still not nearly as\nmuch UV flux as on a clear day with no hole,'' Arrigo says.\n\n   Another important factor is that, at any given time, around 80\npercent of the southern hemisphere's ozone hole is over ice. So\nonly a small fraction of phytoplankton in Southern Ocean waters\nfeels the full brunt of ozone depletion, he says. Both these\nfactors were incorporated into the new models.\n\n   Raymond Smith, at the University of California, Santa Barbara,\nwho did landmark research on the effect of increased UV-B on\nphytoplankton, says that marine plankton have adapted to cope with\nthe hole.\n\n   ``It's obvious that the impact isn't going to be catastrophic,''\nhe says. ``We've had the ozone hole for a decade and a half and the\nsystem is still there.''\n\n   Although Arrigo's results are good news, he says we shouldn't\nstop worrying about ozone depletion, because phytoplankton is only\none component of the ecosystem. ``There may be species shifts going\non that no one is aware of,'' he says.\n\n   And we shouldn't forget that Southern Ocean phytoplankton could\nbe stretched to their limit in absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\n\n   ``Right now, they're keeping up,'' he says, ``but if the problem\ngets worse who knows?''\n\n     (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.)     \n","Headline":"\nPLANKTON ESCAPE RAVAGES OF OZONE DEPLETION  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., FEB. 21, 2000)\n","Text":["\n   The ozone hole above Antarctica may not be damaging life in the\nocean below after all.
