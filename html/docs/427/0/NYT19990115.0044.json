THIS IS PART ONE.\n      RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.\n      Georgia man's battle to regain his eyesight provides inspiration\nfor big-screen romance\n      By Lillian Lee Kim\n      c. 1999 Cox News Service\n\n   ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he\ntalks to them, which is disconcerting. But he isn't being rude or\nshy.\n\n   He can see, all right. He just hasn't gotten used to making eye\ncontact during a conversation. He forgets to look down, too, for\ncurbs and chairs and other obstacles below eye level.\n\n   When he was blind, as he was for most of his 58 years, he never\nhad to worry about such things.\n\n   ``I'm so used to looking straight ahead,'' the Conyers (Ga.)\nresident said good-humoredly. ``Being blind was more easy\nsometimes.''\n\n   Jennings is among the 20 or so people ever known to have\nregained their eyesight after lifelong blindness. A professional\nmasseur, he was blind for more than 40 years until two operations\nin 1991 restored his sight.\n\n   His extraordinary metamorphosis made headlines at the time and\nwas the subject of a 1995 article in The New Yorker magazine, ``To\nSee or Not See,'' by neurologist Oliver Sacks. His experiences also\ninspired the movie romance ``At First Sight,'' starring Val Kilmer\nand Mira Sorvino, which opens Friday in Atlanta theaters.\n\n   Don't expect the movie to tell Jennings' life story _ key\nelements have been altered, Hollywood-style. The film is set in New\nYork instead of metro Atlanta, and the main characters are much\nyounger than Jennings and his wife, Barbara, who is 51.\n\n   Yet the Jenningses say the movie is surprisingly accurate on\nwhat is to them the most crucial point: For those who have learned\nto live without it, the gift of eyesight can be a tremendous,\noverwhelming burden.\n\n   When Jennings regained his eyesight, his doctors discovered he\nhad lost virtually all visual memory. His eyes were functioning,\nyet the visual cues he was receiving seemed at odds with the\nsounds, smells and textures that for decades had been his means of\nobserving the world.\n\n   Faces were meaningless blurs; airplanes flying at 30,000 feet\nseemed to skim inches over his head. He could not recognize a whole\ntree, let alone a forest.\n\n   ``He knew the top and bottom separately, the trunk, the\nleaves,'' Mrs. Jennings said. ``It took him 6 months to put a tree\ntogether.''\n\n   He faced other adjustments no one had anticipated. As a masseur\nfor 25 years at the DeKalb YMCA (Ga.), Jennings had felt secure in\nhis familiarity with skin and hair, muscle and bone.\n\n   ``He came home to me one day and growled, `I can see the bodies\nI'm working on, and I don't like it!' '' Barbara laughed.\n\n   There were laughs, but far more frustrations.\n\n   Born in 1940 in Bedford County, Va., Shirley Jennings was a\nlively toddler until age 3, when he became dangerously ill with\nthree illnesses at once: meningitis, polio and cat scratch fever.\n\n   His sickness plunged him into a coma, from which he emerged\nafter two weeks with paralyzed legs and damaged eyesight. Jennings'\ndetermined 17-year-old mother got his cousins to help him relearn\nhow to crawl and walk, a process that took two or three years and\nultimately succeeded.\n\n   But his eyesight continued to deteriorate. When he was 7 or 8,\nJennings was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive,\nuntreatable disease of the retina that causes blindness. By the\ntime he was 10, he could distinguish only light from dark.\n\n   From then on, Jennings learned to live sightless. He attended\nthe Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in Staunton, Va., and\nlater the YMCA School of Swedish Massage.\n\n   He learned to recognize people by their footfalls, by the feel\nof their skin. Fellow blind masseurs passed along clients' more\nunusual characteristics, such as a hairy foot, and when Jennings\nencountered these people on his massage table, he astonished them\nby identifying them by name.\n\n   Over the decades, he became resigned to his blindness, as\nconsistency at work and at home taught him contentment. That began\nto change in the late 1980s when he heard that an old girlfriend,\nBarbara, whom he had dated two decades earlier, had divorced her\nhusband and returned to Atlanta.\n\n   ``I called,'' Jennings said. ``She had a beautiful, distinctive\nvoice. After 20 years, we were right back where we were before.''\n\n   ``He said he wouldn't let me get away this time,'' Mrs. Jennings\nsaid.\n\n   In 1991, soon after they started dating again, she urged\nJennings to visit her family ophthalmologist in Dunwoody (Ga.), Dr.\nTrevor Woodhams. Jennings hadn't been to an eye doctor in 10 years,\nthinking it futile. But she was adamant that he seek a fresh\nopinion.\n\n   ``He had already reconciled himself to the fact that he would\nnever see again,'' Woodhams recalled. ``He was humoring Barbara,\nthat was how it appeared to me.''\n\n   Nonetheless, Woodhams was interested. Jennings had extremely\ndense cataracts, so opaque it was impossible to determine the\ncondition of his retinas, supposedly degraded beyond repair by\nretinitis pigmentosa.\n\n   Surprisingly, tests of the optic nerves showed they were still\nviable.\n\n   ``He had the capacity of some vision,'' Woodhams said. ``How\nmuch was anybody's guess.''\n\n   Woodhams speculated that removing the cataracts might restore\nJennings' eyesight. Jennings was hesitant, saying it was too much\ntrouble and expense for such a small chance of return.\n\n   ``But Barbara's attitude was, if there's any chance at all,\nlet's go for it,'' Woodhams said.\n\n   Mrs. Jennings' intensely bright blue eyes don't so much as\ntwinkle as she downplays her role in her husband's decision.\n\n   ``I had to stay out of it,'' she insisted. ``He had to live with\nit.''\n\n   ``It was worth a gamble,'' Jennings said with a nod.\n\n   Woodhams spends most Monday mornings in surgical scrubs,\nperforming cataract removal operations at the surgical center\nadjoining his Dunwoody clinic.\n\n   The procedure has not changed drastically in the seven years\nsince he used it to restore Jennings' eyesight. One difference is\nthat Woodhams now uses a local anesthetic that allows the patient\nto see as soon as a few hours after surgery. In Jennings' case, he\nused a shot that temporarily paralyzed the optic nerve, which kept\nthem from learning the outcome until the next day.\n\n   Watching Woodhams in surgery is marvelous. His hands, small and\nfinely shaped, are all that moves when he operates; the rest of his\nbody remains absolutely still, his torso upright and his eyes\nlocked onto the microscope that magnifies the patient's eye to\nroughly 20 times actual size.\n\n   Using an ultrasound tool he describes as a tiny jackhammer,\nWoodhams scrapes away the existing lens. Through the microscope,\none can see the instrument plowing minuscule furrows in the lens,\ngradually revealing the clear pupil beneath.\n\n   Woodhams inserts a minute tube within the thin membrane covering\nthe eye and deftly implants the new artificial lens. Then he gently\nnudges the iris back into shape around the lens. No stitches are\nrequired.\n\n   The entire operation takes no more than half an hour. Woodhams\nshrugs out of his sterile gown, stuffs his surgical cap in the\npocket of his scrubs and recalls how Jennings' first operation in\nSeptember 1991, to remove the cataract in the right eye, was\nnothing heroic.\n\n   Lillian Lee Kim writes science and health stories for the\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Shirl Jennings doesn't look people in the eye when he\ntalks to them, which is disconcerting.
