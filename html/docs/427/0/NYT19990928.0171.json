Flanders\n      c. 1999 Cox News Service\n\n   ATLANTA _ If there's one rule when it comes to framing and\ndisplaying art in the home, it's this: There are none.\n\n   Sure, some basic principles apply _ choosing a mat and frame\nthat doesn't overpower the subject, hanging the art at eye level,\nlighting the picture so that it can be fully appreciated.\n\n   ``But for every rule, there's an un-rule,'' said Myott (who uses\nonly one name) of Myott's Studio, a custom framing gallery in\nAtlanta.\n\n   A grouping of photos matted and framed in a variety of sizes and\nmaterials can be disruptive, he said. ``But then, sometimes clutter\ncan be different, too.''\n\n   The bottom line, he said, is pictures should be framed and\ndisplayed to their best advantage while at the same time\ncomplementing a home's decor. After that, think outside the frame,\ner, box.\n\n   It works for one of Myott's most famous customers _ Elton John.\nAn avid collector, the part-time Atlantan is loaning 200 of his\n2,000 photographs to the High Museum of Art for an exhibit,\n``Chorus of Light: Photographs From the Sir Elton John\nCollection,'' next year. Many of John's photographs hang in his\npenthouse on Peachtree Road. Myott is framing some 800 of them.\n\n   ``With that many, you have to come up with something\ndifferent,'' Myott said. ``He's bought some of the most expensive\nand finest pieces in the world.''\n\n   So you wouldn't expect the British rock musician to rummage the\nframe stacks at Wal-Mart. Instead, Myott is hand-gilding some\nframes. Some are done in 12- and 22-karat gold. Others feature\nrubbed black and warm silver finishes. Photographs as small as 1 by\n2 inches have been ``enlarged'' with a mat and 5-inch wide frame.\nYou'd think such proportions would overwhelm the subject; instead,\nthey entice the eye into looking a little closer.\n\n   Not everyone can afford to frame an entire collection at once.\nBesides, most art is acquired over time. ``When someone starts\nbuying art, they usually hang pieces one by one. But if you get\naddicted to it, you can't do that,'' said Jane Jackson, an Atlanta\nart dealer. ``The next thing is to start grouping them together.''\n\n   Ideally, artwork should be planned for when building or\nremodeling a home so that proper lighting can be installed, she\nsaid.\n\n   Regardless of the stage at which your photo collection falls,\nhere are some points to consider:\n\n      Make frames secondary to subjects. While the art is the focus,\nthat doesn't mean you have to use the same old moldings, said\nAtlanta interior designer Bill Cook, an avid collector of\nphotography. Be creative. Use a frame from a mirror. Ask your\nframer to use your own materials, such as fabrics and wallpaper, or\nones that hold sentimental value. ``Sometimes, we'll take a wood\nfrom somebody's barn and frame their pictures,'' Myott said. The\npoint is to consider more than the usual suspects. ``Ten years ago,\nthings were all framed in metal with simple white mats,'' Jackson\nsaid. ``Now, there are so many interesting materials until the\nframing has become an important part of the piece.''\n\n      Use neutral mats. Mats are sold in every color, but large\nneutral ones best complement black and white photos, Myott said. By\ndouble- or triple-matting, you can add a sliver of color that picks\nup other hues in the room. ``Sometimes, we use silks because the\nfine grain gives a subtle and rich texture, especially for fashions\nphotos,'' he said.\n\n      Protect your photos. Use a reputable framer who knows how to\nprotect photos from harmful sunlight, using archival mats,\nUV-protection glass and acid-free backing paper. Photos should not\nbe hung in direct sunlight or near heating vents.\n\n      Organize displays. Depending on how many pictures you own, one\nway to organize a collection is by subject matter. Six nature\nphotos can make a grouping. Because the topics are related, you can\nvary the materials used to frame them. (Just don't mix color photos\nwith black and whites.) Conversely, if the subjects are all\ndifferent, use the same frame to unify the collection. Jackson, an\nart consultant to John who brought him and the museum together,\nsaid the November 2000 exhibit will give visitors an idea of how\nthe star displays his photography at home. ``A lot of things are\nhung from floor to ceiling with whole walls covered in\nphotographs,'' she said. ``One wall is all images of women. Another\nis vintage 1920s, and another room has all photos by one artist.\nThere's definite thought into the way they're put together.''\n\n      Create scale with groupings. For large walls, a grouping can\nbe more effective than a single picture, even a large one. For\nrooms with low ceilings, stack several pictures vertically to\ncreate the illusion of height.\n\n      Hang at eye level _ depending: Most people hang artwork too\nhigh, Myott said. ``Sometimes, when I go in homes it looks like\neverything's attached to helium.'' In general, the middle of a\npicture should be no higher than 60 inches from the floor, Jackson\nsaid. Yet, there are exceptions, such as in the case of groupings.\nArt also should be hung in relation to what's around it, such as\nthe furniture below it. Pictures above a sofa, for example, should\nbe hung lower.\n\n      Map out a display. Before driving a nail, sketch a plan for\nhow the pictures will be displayed or at least lay them on the\nfloor in the desired pattern, Jackson said. Depending on the wall's\nsize, allow 2 inches between frames, or at least a consistent\namount throughout.\n\n      Accent the positive. Why spend money on artwork and framing\nwithout ensuring the piece will be properly seen? Make sure\npictures have adequate lighting, either from ceiling recessed\nhalogens, track fixtures or picture lamps.\n\n      Don't hang everything at once: If your collection is large,\nconsider rotating pictures in a display. By using one size mat and\nframe, even individual pictures within a grouping can be changed\nperiodically to freshen the grouping, Jackson said.\n\n      Don't hang everything _ period: Consider unconventional\ndisplays. Cook suggests propping photos on a mantel, shelf or\nnarrow wall ledge, available at photo and art supply stores. Or you\ncan make a ledge using a wide strip of molding. Ledges are\nparticularly effective in hallways where most people struggle to\nfill large expanses of wall space. Large pictures also can be\nplaced in the seat of a chair and leaned against the back. ``In\nsmall apartments, a lot of people just lean things on the floor\nagainst the wall,'' Jackson said. The advantage is photos can\neasily be changed _ without leaving walls looking like slices of\nSwiss cheese.\n\n   Danny C.
