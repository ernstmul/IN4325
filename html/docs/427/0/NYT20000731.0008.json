Along that path, it would emit hundreds of\nhigh-energy X-ray bursts of varying intensity, following a firing\npattern calculated to disintegrate the tumor without damaging the\neye.\n\n   ``I'll be 90 in September,'' Riley said. ``I want to live and I\nwant to have my sight.''\n\n   Riley has a fighting chance of getting both wishes, thanks to\nthe convergence of several advances _ including new ways to\npinpoint tumors, more precise X-ray guns, and computer-driven\ntreatment plans _ that enable radiation therapists to bombard\ncancers while they tiptoe around sensitive nerves.\n\n   ``We can now put higher doses of radiation into tumors than ever\nbefore, and cut way down on the dose that hits the tissues you\ndon't want to affect,'' said Dr. Theodore Phillips, a radiation\noncologist at the University of California at San Francisco, where\nRiley is being treated.\n\n   ``We're using it in many locations,'' Phillips said. ``Head and\nneck, prostate, lung, everywhere you have normal tissue that you\nwant to protect close to the tumor.''\n\n   This new technique, called Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy\n(IMRT), has moved from the experimental stage into clinical\npractice in the past few years. But the procedure's high price and\ncomplexity have made IMRT relatively rare in hospitals and not well\nunderstood even among cancer professionals.\n\n   IMRT will be discussed this week, when 2,700 cancer specialists\nassemble in San Francisco for the annual meeting of the American\nHead and Neck Society.\n\n   Cancer fighters are a specialized breed. In addition to having\ntumor specialties, such as head and neck, they take different\ntreatment approaches. Surgeons cut out tumors. Radiation\noncologists blast them with X-rays. Medical oncologists poison them\nwith chemotherapy.\n\n   Increasingly, all three techniques are used in combination, but\na certain lack of understanding remains among experts in the three\napproaches. Dr. Jesus Medina, a cancer surgeon and president of the\nHead and Neck Society, said a seminar tomorrow morning will help\nexplain the new radiation therapies to practitioners of the other\ncancer-fighting arts.\n\n   Understanding state-of-the-art radiation therapy is complicated\nby the fact that the advances are not the result a single\nbreakthrough, but the convergence of several developments,\nbeginning with some astonishing improvements in imaging\ntechnologies that peer under the skin.\n\n   ``The new imaging technologies allow us to distinguish the\nnormal tissues from the cancer cells with a precision that wasn't\npossible even a few years ago,'' said Geoffrey Dalbow, a physicist\nwith Varian Medical Systems in Palo Alto, Calif., a leader in\nradiation oncology systems.\n\n   Dalbow said radiation oncologists use an array of imaging\ntechniques to get several different views of the tumor. Then they\nassemble these data, using software programs, into a treatment plan\nthat drives the radiation gun.\n\n   According to Dalbow, these images typically include CT or MRI\nscans, which lay out the basic position of the organs inside the\nbody, showing the location of sensitive tissues in relation to the\ntumor.\n\n   To get a more precise fix on the tumor, physicians rely on\nseveral technologies, including MRS scans. An MRS scan is a variant\nof an MRI. Scientists have shown that certain molecules are found\nin higher concentrations in cancer cells. MRS instruments detect\nthe magnetic signature of these molecules, and plot areas of\nconcentration, which equate with cancer hot spots.\n\n   Other imaging systems are used to double-check tumor locations.\nBecause cancer cells are constantly growing and dividing, they\nconsume more of the body's basic fuel, glucose, than normal cells.\n\n   To get a better understanding of the malignant tumor, cancer\nspecialists give patients a small dose of radioactive glucose and\nmeasure which cells absorb the most of this nutrient. A technology\ncalled SPECT detects the irradiated sugar. High concentrations\nindicate tumor cells.\n\n   With these imaging clues, radiation oncologists draw a tumor\ntarget area, and decide how large a dose of radiation will be\nneeded to kill or control the cancer.\n\n   These targeting techniques would be useless, however, were it\nnot for innovations that have improved the accuracy of radiation\nguns, and allowed these instruments to be controlled by computer\nprograms that can plot and execute firing sequences of astonishing\ncomplexity.\n\n   Dr. Mark Carol, a San Francisco\nneurosurgeon-turned-entrepreneur, played a central role in these\nadvances in the early 1990s. By the time Carol entered the picture,\nradiation guns had evolved into powerful instruments, which could\ntravel over the patient, delivering high-energy X-rays from\ndifferent angles.\n\n   This swiveling feature was a big innovation because of the way\nX-rays kill cancer. As the beams plow through the patient, they\nbreak the DNA of any cell that is about to divide, killing it in\nthe process.\n\n   Radiation treatment is particularly deadly to cancerous cells\nbecause they are constantly dividing.\n\n   However, X-rays are indiscriminate. They also kill fast-dividing\nnormal tissues such as stomach or skin cells. So hitting the cancer\nfrom different angles lessens the damage to innocent cells that\nhappen to be in the path of the beam.\n\n   Carol, who pioneered the IMRT technique, saw what was needed to\nimprove the previous generation of radiation therapy. There had to\nbe a way to modulate the intensity of the radiation beam. The\nradiation guns of early '90s vintage had only two settings: off or\nfull-bore. They could not be controlled like a stove, which can be\nturned up to boil water, but turned down low to melt butter.\n\n   To solve this problem, Carol founded a company called Nomos\nCorp., which came up an ingenious system that did two things:\nFirst, it modulated the intensity of the radiation beam and, more\nimportantly, created a software program that made full use of the\nmodulation capabilities.\n\n   According to Carol, by the early 1990s, radiation sources\nalready were routinely equipped with special lead shutters that\ncontrolled the shape of the beam to conform to the shape of the\ntumor.\n\n   Nomos, which is based in Pennsylvania, adapted the shutter to a\nnew purpose. The company devised a way to open and close the\nshutter rapidly. A longer shutter opening meant more radiation, a\nbrief opening meant a lower dose. In effect, Nomos created a switch\nto control intensity.\n\n   But the real genius of the system lay in the software Nomos\nwrote to marry this intensity control to the targeting data, thus\ncreating a firing pattern that delivers maximum radiation to the\ntumor while minimizing damage to innocent cells.\n\n   The software involved some phenomenal calculations at the\ncrossroads of geometry and biology.\n\n   The geometric component was the arc of the radiation gun as it\ntraveled over the patient. The biological variables were the types\nof organs between the X-ray source and the tumor. Doctors have a\ngood idea how much radiation it takes to kill a tumor. They also\nknow how much radiation different types of healthy cells can absorb\nbefore they suffer unacceptable harm.\n\n   The program's job was to pick out the optimal path, ordering\nlong shutter openings when the imaging data showed the tumor\nshielded by dense bone _ which can absorb more radiation without\nundue damage. On the other hand, the program would close the\nshutter when the X-ray gun passed over a sensitive spot such as\nMarybelle Riley's eye.\n\n   The program generated a firing pattern, which is loaded onto a\nfloppy disk, that could control the radiation gun the way a\nperforated music sheet runs a player piano.\n\n   Radiation oncologists who have used IMRT technology _ which is\nnew, expensive and rare _ say the results are worth it.\n\n   Dr. Richard Hoppe, chairman of the radiation oncology department\nat Stanford University, said patients benefit from fewer side\neffects. Treating head and neck cancers with radiation often means\nkilling saliva glands, and causing side-effects such as loss of\ntaste and tooth decay.\n\n   ``With IMRT, you can reduce the dose to the salivary glands,\navoiding these complications,'' Hoppe said.\n\n   A scientific paper written by cancer researchers Michael\nZelefsky and Steven Leibel of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital\nalso suggests IMRT can improve cure rates, by allowing radiation\noncologists to give higher doses to tumors in sensitive spots _\nsuch as the prostate _ with fewer side effects than conventional\ntherapies.\n\n   Since Nomos brought its system through the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration approval process in the mid-1990s, similar systems\nhave appeared. Some are third-party programs that work with the\nradiation guns produced by the Big Three X-ray firms: Varian\nMedical in Palo Alto; Siemens Medical Systems in Walnut Creek,\nCalif., which is a division of a German multinational; and Elekta,\na Swedish firm. Varian has also developed its own software system\nthat runs with its own, as well as with competing, X-ray guns.\n\n   IMRT systems aren't cheap. If a hospital has a modern radiation\ndevice, it might cost $300,000 to $500,000 to add the IMRT system.\nThe price tag on the latest X-ray source along with an IMRT package\ncould be $2 million.\n\n   So far, the few dozen IMRT systems used in medical practice are\nfound mainly in leading-edge medical centers such as UCSF and\nStanford. But financial analyst James Terwilliger, with the Houston\ninvestment bank of Sanders Morris Harris, predicts cancer centers\nat most hospitals will buy IMRT systems because radiation therapy _\nwhich can cost $35,000 _ is a profit center and the hospitals won't\nwant to see patients go elsewhere.\n\n   ``If this was a drug, it would be a multibillion-dollar\nblockbuster,'' he said.\n\n   At UCSF, meanwhile, Marybelle Riley lay perfectly still as the\nradiation gun passed overhead, making a sound like chattering teeth\nas the lead shutters quickly opened and shut, opened and shut,\nhundreds of times, under orders from the computer-driven treatment\nplan.\n\n   When the chattering stopped, members of the medical team helped\nthe elderly patient get ready for the ride home.\n\n   ``It's going to work out,'' Riley said, as a home health nurse\nwheeled her down the hall. ``I know it is.''\n\n   E-mail Tom Abate at    abate(AT)sfgate.com   .\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marybelle Riley sat in the hospital waiting room\nmaking small talk, with a patch over one eye _ the one caught in\nthe grip of a virulent tumor that clutched at her optic nerve.\n","\n   ``The cancer is way up under here,'' said Riley, 89, brushing\nher lower left eyelid.\n","\n   In a lead-lined room down the hall, technicians prepped the\ncomputer-driven linear accelerator that would soon travel in a wide\narc over Riley's body.
