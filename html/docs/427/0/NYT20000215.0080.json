Flipping through a photo album today, she can easily\nspot the white reflection in her toddler's eye that was caused by a\nrare and potentially fatal cancer.\n\n   ``It is so obvious now,'' said Gaito, who lives in suburban\nAlbany. ``Her eye looks like the flash went off in it.''\n\n   Although it sounds strange, photos are actually one of the\nearliest ways parents can detect these malignant eye tumors, known\nas retinoblastoma.\n\n   The cancer strikes at birth or during the first few years of a\nchild's life, and affects about 5,000 children worldwide. In the\nUnited States, an estimated 350 children will be diagnosed this\nyear, usually by the time they are 2 1/2.\n\n   Yet the earliest symptoms are often overlooked by parents who\nassume they or their camera are to blame for the peculiar white\nreflection in their photos. And most pediatricians and family\npractitioners don't routinely screen for the cancer at well-child\nvisits.\n\n   ``More than half of the children who get this in the year 2000\nwill die,'' said Dr. David Abramson, director of the Ophthalmology\nCenter at New York Presbyterian Hospital: University Hospital of\nColumbia and Cornell. ``In Latin America, for example, only half\nthe children survive the disease.''\n\n   For children born in the United States, the odds are much better\nbecause of revolutionary strides in treatment over the past five\nyears, from lasers to chemotherapy.\n\n   But again, the key is early detection. ``Family practice\nphysicians and pediatricians need to be looking for an abnormal\npupil or abnormal light reflex,'' said Dr. George Stasior, an\nAlbany ophthalmologist working to raise awareness of the problem.\n``We're asking the doctors to ask their parents if they notice\nanything unusual and if they do, to bring in a photograph of their\nchild.''\n\n   White reflections in photos, however, aren't the only clue\nparents should be aware of.\n\n   A child may have what looks like a cataract. Other symptoms\ninclude a red, painful eye; poor vision; inflammation of tissue\naround the eye or an enlarged or dilated pupil.\n\n   The standard treatment for the condition has been to remove the\naffected eye or eyes to prevent the spread of the cancer. About 75\npercent of all cases will involve only one eye.\n\n   ``The first thing you have to get the parents to understand is,\nyou have to save the child's life; next you try to save the eye,''\nStasior said.\n\n   Studies have shown that although radiation may shrink the size\nof the cancerous tumors, it poses special risks, especially for\nchildren under one. Infants who have been treated with radiation\nend up having a higher risk of other cancers later in life,\nAbramson said.\n\n   In Gaito's case, three doctors agreed that the best course of\ntreatment for her daughter was to have the eye removed. Haley, now\n2 1/2, has been fitted with a prosthetic eye.\n\n   While growing up with one eye isn't expected to be a problem,\nHaley still needs frequent visits to specialists to make sure the\ncancer hasn't returned or begun to grow behind the other eye. ``We\ndo have to worry about it coming back,'' her mother said.\n\n   Although researchers aren't exactly sure why retinoblastoma\noccurs, it is known to be associated with an abnormality on the\nchromosome responsible for controlling retinal cell division.\n\n   In children with retinoblastoma, retinal cell division becomes\nunchecked, causing the growth of tumors. Although the disease may\nsometimes be hereditary, the majority of retinoblastoma patients\nhave no history of the disease.\n\n   As with many cancers, gene therapy holds promise for the future\ntreatment of retinoblastoma, Abramson said. Other potential\napproaches include in-vitro fertilization for parents who carry the\nabnormal gene to pre-select healthy zygotes.\n\n   Within the next decade, Abramson also predicts progress will be\nmade in treating this condition before the baby is born.\n\n   In the interim, parents remain the best watchdogs for detecting\nthis cancer early.\n\n   Gaito decided to get Haley's eye checked after consulting with a\nneighbor, who confirmed her suspicions that something didn't look\nright. Ironically, she had just taken her daughter in for her\n2-year-old check-up, and the pediatrician didn't notice anything.\n\n   ``I just wish someone had informed me, because maybe we could\nhave caught it earlier,'' Gaito said. ``This could have been very\nserious if I hadn't done anything about it.''\n","Headline":"\n      PHOTOS MAY HELP DETECT EYE TUMORS IN INFANTS \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kim Gaito wondered why she didn't notice the\nsigns earlier.
