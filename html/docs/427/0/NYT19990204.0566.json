The Suns have a\nchance to surprise.\n\n   ``He's right, the West is strong,'' Kidd said of Harris'\npreseason analysis. ``You've got a lot of teams that are talented,\nwith the Lakers, Houston, Utah, San Antonio and Seattle. Hopefully,\nwe can just lay in the weeds. Those teams are the most dangerous.\nThose teams have all the pressure.\n\n   ``Nobody's talking about us, and that's the way to start a\nseason.

Against Dallas, both\nplayed well enough to suggest that maybe the Suns have found some\nkeepers. Bailey looks to be agile and tough. In two exhibitions\nagainst Dallas, Garrity averaged 15.5 points on 50 percent\nshooting. But, again, neither has appeared in a regular season\ngame.\n\n   The other question, defense, was highlighted against Dallas, a\nleague lightweight last year.
