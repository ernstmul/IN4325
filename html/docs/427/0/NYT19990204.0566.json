But the eventual mix has\nbeen hard to evaluate for even the Suns.\n\n   ``I don't have a much better idea than anybody else at this\npoint,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, whose work in progress\nstarted amid the chaos of an abbreviated training camp and a\nfrenetic free-agent shuffle that started with the loss of Antonio\nMcDyess to Denver and continued with the acquisition of Gugliotta.\n\n   Despite all the early uncertainty, Ainge remains upbeat about\nchances that the Suns will strike the right mix and challenge at\nthe end of a 50-game season. The only sure bet is that they won't\nrepeat last season's 56 wins.\n\n   Whatever success they have won't come easily.

In other words, they are an afterthought. Go\nahead, ask a coach _ almost any coach _ for his preseason analysis.\nInevitably, the Suns are almost forgotten.\n\n   In conference calls with league coaches this week, Del Harris of\nthe Los Angeles Lakers, one of the favorites, talked about the Utah\nJazz, San Antonio Spurs, Houston, Rockets and Seattle SuperSonics\nbefore he hastily included the Suns as a possibility toward the end\nof his remarks. Harris wanted to be careful not to exclude the\nSuns, but it was evident that he didn't know what to make of them.\n\n   There's a built-in advantage amid the anonymity. The Suns have a\nchance to surprise.\n\n   ``He's right, the West is strong,'' Kidd said of Harris'\npreseason analysis. ``You've got a lot of teams that are talented,\nwith the Lakers, Houston, Utah, San Antonio and Seattle. Hopefully,\nwe can just lay in the weeds. Those teams are the most dangerous.\nThose teams have all the pressure.\n\n   ``Nobody's talking about us, and that's the way to start a\nseason. You want them ``all'' to be talking about you at the end.''\n\n   The lack of preseason buzz surrounding the Suns is rooted in two\nareas: suspect depth and suspect defense.\n\n   Of the two, the first appears to be the most critical. Fears of\nseason-ending injuries are unavoidable in the Suns' thinking.\n\n   Guard Rex Chapman, a dependable shooter and unyielding\ncompetitor, might not play in tonight's opener against the Clippers\nin Los Angeles because of a nagging problems with his right\nhamstring. Over a compressed schedule with sometimes four games a\nweek, there is concern about whether Chapman can last. The worry\nexplains this week's acquisition of swingman Chris Morris.\n\n   Morris has some of the same versatility as guard-forward George\nMcCloud, who is a possible starter in his second season on the\nPhoenix roster. Morris could be a redundant addition. But in a\ncompressed season, Ainge might need as many parts as possible, no\nmatter how redundant.\n\n   Furthermore, there are questions about the backups at nearly\nevery position. Kidd's backup, Gerald Brown, the Terry Porter\nlook-alike from Carl Hayden High School, showed poise and ability\nin two preseason victories over Dallas. But he has yet to play in a\nregular season game.\n\n   The same can be said of forward Pat Garrity, a first-round draft\npick, and Toby Bailey, a second-round pick. Against Dallas, both\nplayed well enough to suggest that maybe the Suns have found some\nkeepers. Bailey looks to be agile and tough. In two exhibitions\nagainst Dallas, Garrity averaged 15.5 points on 50 percent\nshooting. But, again, neither has appeared in a regular season\ngame.\n\n   The other question, defense, was highlighted against Dallas, a\nleague lightweight last year.

Can any of\nthese Suns play defense?\n\n   In time, Ainge thinks so. The physical Kidd already is\nacknowledged as one of the league's best backcourt defenders. With\nthe acquisition of 7-foot-2 center Luc Longley from Chicago, the\nSuns can start one of the biggest front lines in their history with\n6-10 Gugliotta at one forward and 6-10 Clifford Robinson at the\nother.\n\n   They also appear to be more equipped to endure the slower, more\nphysical playoffs.\n\n   One thing appears unchanged. The Suns always have been a team\nbuilt to score.
