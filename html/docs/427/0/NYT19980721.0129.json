The mishap kept her\nout of the water and convinced her that contacts no longer fit her\nactive lifestyle.\n\n   From the moment her doctor diagnosed her nearsightedness in\neighth grade, she was too vain to wear glasses. ``They stayed in my\npurse until I got contacts,'' she said.\n\n   Today, Weidman isn't using contacts or glasses. In February,\nciting the diving incident as a turning point, the 25-year-old\nregistered nurse opted for corrective laser surgery on her eyes.\n\n   Her vision is now close to perfect. ``Now it's 20-20 on the\nright and 20-25 on the left,'' said Weidman, who lives in\nBrunswick, N.Y.\n\n   The promise of better vision, without the hassle of cumbersome\neye wear, is luring thousands to have their eyes sliced and\nreshaped by a special laser, at an average cost of $2,500 per eye.\n\n   An estimated 60 million Americans suffer from myopia or\nnearsightedness, a condition that makes it difficult to see objects\nin the distance.\n\n   Until October 1995, when the Food and Drug Administration\napproved the new excimer laser for use in eye surgery, the options\nwere corrective glasses, contacts or a relatively primitive\nprocedure known as RK, or radial keratotomy. In that surgery, the\ndoctor flattens out the cornea by making incisions with a scalpel.\n\n   Today, depending on your ophthalmologist and condition, you may\nhear a sales pitch for one of two laser procedures known as PRK and\nLASIK. Both use a laser beam to deliver bursts of ultraviolet light\nto reshape the cornea. Because the eyes are anesthetized with\nspecial drops, there is no pain.\n\n   The results are faster healing and, generally, fewer\ncomplications.\n\n   ``What we have now is a lot better,'' said Dr. Allen W. Zieker,\nof Troy Eye Associates and Albany Cataract & Laser Associates.\n\n   Indeed, laser eye surgery is a major advance in vision\ntechnology. In the early 1980s, RK meant up to 32 incisions in the\neye with a tool akin to a broken razor blade. Today, people have a\nhost of new, less invasive options for dealing with everything from\nmyopia to cataracts.\n\n   While two lasers have been approved by the FDA to treat\nnearsightedness, the jury is still out on its effectiveness at\ntreating farsightedness and farsightedness with astigmatism.\n\n   The hope is that the 30 million to 50 million Americans\nsuffering from those conditions also could benefit. Clinical trials\nto test the procedure are under way and FDA approval is pending.\n\n   ``You've got a huge market,'' said George Koo, an analyst who\ntracks the laser eye surgery industry with Burnham Securities, a\nNew York investment firm.\n\n   Some 350,000 surgeries are expected by the end of this year, up\nfrom 200,000 in 1997, and more than three times the number in 1996.\n\n   He said much of the initial fear about the surgery is wearing\noff and people are more open to the idea. ``It took a couple of\nyears to educate the consumers,'' Koo said.\n\n   Industry statistics show that people are willing to pay for this\nnew technology in exchange for clearer vision and convenience. Koo\nsays the price isn't expected to come down soon, in part because\nthe excimer laser is so costly. It can sell for as much as\n$500,000.\n\n   Good results aren't guaranteed. The surgery isn't recommended\nfor people younger than 18 or whose vision is still changing,\nsomething that can occur well into adulthood.\n\n   Though most patients do not need glasses after the surgery, some\nstill require them. The surgery also doesn't prevent sight loss due\nto aging, so some patients will eventually need reading glasses or\nrequire cataract surgery.\n\n   Other complications include eye haze, glare and overcorrection.\nOne patient had to have an eye redone after a wrinkle formed on\npart of her corneal tissue.\n\n   For anyone weighing the benefits and risks, the decision of\nwhether to have laser surgery often comes down to dollars and\ncents. Considered cosmetic surgery, corrective eye surgery isn't\ncovered by most insurance plans.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   Patients should also know that the FDA has approved lasers to\nperform only PRK, a procedure where the doctor scrapes off the top\nlayer of corneal tissue and then uses a computer-guided laser to\nreshape the cornea.\n\n   To aid the healing, the surgeon covers the wound with a contact\nlens that is later removed. There is no bandage. With PRK, it takes\nat least three days for the eye membranes to heal and up to several\nmonths for vision to fully improve.\n\n   With LASIK, often called ``flap-and-zap'' surgery, the procedure\ninvolves cutting a flap in the cornea, using a surgical instrument\nknown as a microkeratome and folding it away from the eye so the\nlaser can zap tiny amounts of tissue. The flap is then folded back\ninto place, giving the patient a newly shaped cornea.\n\n   Because cutting is less invasive than scraping, the eye membrane\nheals almost immediately and vision is improved in a matter of\nhours, not months.\n\n   In both procedures, you should allow up to two hours for the\nentire process. Though you remain awake during the surgery, you\nwill need someone else to drive you home.\n\n   Your doctor should inform you that LASIK, the more complicated\nprocedure, is still awaiting FDA approval and the surgery is\ntechnically considered an ``off-label'' use of the laser and\nmicrokeratome. Since the FDA only regulates drugs and technology,\nand not medical practice, the only requirement is that doctors\ninform patients of that fact before they agree to the surgery.\n\n   If you're considering either PRK or LASIK, experts say you\nshould be careful about who you elect to do the surgery. Because\nmany insurance companies no longer cover surgery for cataracts,\nhealth experts say there's a financial incentive for doctors to get\ninto the booming business of laser eye surgery.\n\n   ``Experience is key,'' Koo said.\n\n   Dr. Sandra Belmont, a New York City ophthalmologist and\nspokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmologists, agrees.\n\n   She advises people to look for doctors who have completed a\ntraining program offered by the two manufacturers that make the\nFDA-approved lasers, Visx and Summit. And she recommends looking\nfor a doctor who performs a minimum of 10 procedures a week with\none of the approved lasers.\n\n   ``There are doctors that are starting to get into this who don't\nhave a lot of experience,'' she said.\n\n   The FDA says some patients have been permanently injured,\nincluding cases that required corneal implants.\n","Headline":"\nLASER SURGERY MAY SHED NEED FOR EYEGLASSES \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mary Weidman was diving off the island of St.\nLucia in January when she lost a contact lens.
