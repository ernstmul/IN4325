GUZMAN  \n c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  \n\n   SAN ANTONIO _ For most of us guys, the extent of facial\nmaintenance back in high school was plopping Clearasil on pimples.\n\n   But once we graduate from adolescence, our faces take on a new\ntexture. Zits may come and go, but now we have razor burn, skin\ncancer and wrinkles to worry about.\n\n   Face it _ we may know a thing or two about shaving, but most of\nus don't know soap when it comes to keeping our faces clean and\nhealthy. And with Old Man Winter chafing our cheeks, it's time we\nlearned for the long haul.\n\n   ``A lot of times, men are clueless because they didn't read the\nsame kinds of magazines girls were reading when they were\nteen-agers,'' said Dr. Chris Nanni, a dermatologist in New York who\nsaid that most men never grew up learning how to take care of their\nskin.\n\n   That hasn't exactly stopped us from bumming moisturizer from\nwomen.\n\n   Still, guys aren't necessarily coming out of the medicine\ncabinet.\n\n   ``One reason why people haven't recognized (men's skin care) as\nmuch is that men can use the same products as women,'' said Dr.\nDarrick Antell, a plastic surgeon on New York's Park Avenue. ``It's\nhard to segment it out. If a product is geared toward men, it's\njust in the packaging.''\n\n   Sounds like something strong enough for a man but made for a\nwomen, huh?\n\n   Truth is, skin _ male or female _ is similar in structure,\nalthough men tend to have more hair and increased oil production.\n\n   ``Men are somewhat fortunate since they shave and exfoliate\nbetter than a woman does,'' said Judith Battista, a skin specialist\nat Aesthetic Enhancement, a San Antonio clinic that provides skin\ntreatment and plastic surgery.\n\n   Exfoliation is simply removing dead skin buildup from the\nsurface. The epidermis, or skin layer, is constantly sloughing off\ndead cells, which may clog pores. Exfoliation occurs with washing\nor shaving.\n\n   ``The key role in anything is to really exfoliate the skin,''\nBattista said. ``Even models have been shaving the skin for years.\nIf a man was to put a razor to his whole face, he'd probably have a\nbetter face.''\n\n   Not so fast. There's a better way to keep your face clean\nwithout relying on the cheek sickle.\n\n   Let's look at what dry winter air does to your mug. During the\ncolder months, humidity levels are low. As the cooler atmosphere\nsucks away moisture from the face, your skin becomes less flexible.\nIronically, going inside to warm up doesn't help.\n\n   ``Most heaters in people's homes and work environments take the\nmoisture out of the air,'' Nanni said. ``And that's a double\nwhammy.''\n\n   Short of moving to a tropical climate, there are ways to give\nyour face a break in the winter.\n\n   Start off by splashing your face with warm water. Hot water robs\nyour face of natural oils.\n\n   ``The worst thing you can do is put soap on the face,'' Battista\nsaid. ``Anything that's in bar form has wax in it, and that causes\nyou to get a waxy buildup.''\n\n   Consider a chemical exfoliator with either alpha-hydroxy or\nsalicylic acid. They will gently remove that dead layer of skin and\nleave your face baby-bottom smooth. Glycerin soaps or\nimpurity-cleansing clay soaps also work wonders.\n\n   And forget cloths and sponges. Use your fingers, washing in\ngentle, circular motions.\n\n   Rinse with cool water to lock in moisture.\n\n   Don't dry your face just yet _ you still need to moisturize,\nwithin five minutes of washing. ``If you wait longer, the water on\nyour body evaporates and you're worse than before,'' Nanni said.\n\n   If your face is oily, use an oil-free or water-based\nmoisturizer. If your face is dry, your basic petrolatum moisturizer\nwill do. Look for a Vaseline-based cream or an oil-based lotion\nwith Vitamin E.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   You've done all you can to protect your face indoors, but now\nyou need to protect it from the great outdoors. Overexposure to sun\nwill wrinkle your skin long before you're long in the tooth.\n\n   ``Even in winter, those ultraviolet-A rays get through the\nclouds,'' Nanni said. ``With the ozone depleted, it's easy to age\njust walking to the store or sitting in your car.''\n\n   Nanni recommended a UVA or UVB sunblock to help prevent sun\naging, and make sure its SPF (sun protection factor) is at least\n20. Apply it generously.\n\n   Once you're ready to roll, grab a pair of sunglasses before\nyou're out the door.\n\n   ``The area where men suffer the most is crow's feet around the\neyes,'' Nanni said. ``Even wraparound sunglasses are helpful.\nThey're getting increasingly popular, but they also give a lot more\nprotection because they cover the side area of the eyes. They also\nprotect against getting cataracts.''\n\n   Don't forget that kisser. The lips don't have any protective\ncoating, so wrap them up in petroleum jelly every morning after\nbrushing your teeth.

You need to consider external factors like\nsun exposure and smoke exposure. The problem is that this doesn't\nhappen overnight but over years of exposure.
