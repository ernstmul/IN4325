Times News Service clients)  \n By NORM FRAUENHEIM  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   With Antonio McDyess out of the picture, the Suns quickly turned\nto Plan B _ a full-court pursuit of free-agent forward Tom\nGugliotta.\n\n   Gugliotta, a 6-foot-10 forward from the Minnesota Timberwolves,\nbecame the No. 1 priority when McDyess stung Suns management with\nhis return to the Denver Nuggets.\n\n   ``We're not going to be specific about any names, but we expect\nto have some people on the horn, possibly in town, over the next\nday or two,'' said Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who was\nprohibited from identifying the free agents because of NBA lockout\nprohibitions that are scheduled to expire today at noon.\n\n   The Suns' interest in Gugliotta hasn't been a secret since late\nlast season, but it's not clear whether the feeling is mutual.\nAccording to Suns sources, they were attempting to get him into\ntown today.\n\n   Bryan Colangelo referred to Gugliotta Wednesday night as the\nthird player in ``The Big Three'' free agents. The other two were\nMcDyess and Scottie Pippen. With McDyess in Denver and Pippen\nheaded for Houston, Gugliotta is the last domino standing.\n\n   Because the Suns roster is in such disarray, they need an answer\nquickly. If Gugliotta's interest appears to be in playing\nelsewhere, the Suns would be left to divide up their available\nsalary and pick and choose from the free-agent leftovers _ which\nmight include their own Clifford Robinson, center Vlade Divac,\nforward Jason Caffey and guard Brent Barry.\n\n   It's been reported that Gugliotta was waiting on McDyess'\ndecision. After McDyess made his choice, speculation out of Denver\nwas that Gugliotta is leaning toward Phoenix.\n\n   There also was a report in Los Angeles that the Lakers were\ntrying to acquire Gugliotta in a sign-and-trade deal which would\nsend Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam Jacobsen to the\nTimberwolves. But Minnesota management dismissed the report,\nbecause it says the deal's pieces would not fit under the cap.\n\n   Cap restrictions could damage the Suns' chances at signing the\n1998 NBA All-Star.\n\n   The Suns best offer would appear to be six years for $52.8\nmillion. Minnesota can offer a seven-year contract worth $87.5\nmillion.\n\n   There's a $1 million difference in the first year between each\noffer, with Gugliotta getting $8 million from the Suns and $9\nmillion from the Timberwolves.\n\n   A potential advantage in the Suns offer is an option, an early\nout, after the deal's fifth year. That would allow Gugliotta to\njump to a higher-salary tier in a system constructed by the new\nagreement between owners and players.\n\n   It also ensures a chance to shop for a new deal, if and when,\nthere are adjustments in the agreement. In an era of\nrapidly-changing salary-cap restrictions, it provides some\nflexibility.\n\n   But there's little time to consider all the possibilities.\n\n   ``Timing is everything,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who will\nnot be able to open camp today because he will have only three\nplayers, Jason Kidd, Danny Manning and Luc Longley, under contract.\n\n   The Suns first move today will be the renouncing of their rights\nto several of their own free agents, including guard Kevin Johnson\nand center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams. The moves will give them $8\nmillion under the cap.\n\n   All of that will presumably be offered to Gugliotta. But here,\ntoo, is a complication. Suns General Bryan Colangelo and Ainge said\nWednesday night that they want to re-sign Robinson, who had a\none-year contract for a $1 million exception to the cap.\n\n   The Suns could offer him a 20 percent raise, $1.2 million,\nwithout a hit to the cap. But Robinson wants a bigger deal. He was\nattempting to get a five-year, $24 million from Detroit, but the\nPistons instead are expected to sign Loy Vaught and Christian\nLaettner.\n\n   The Suns are counting on the return of guard Rex Chapman, who\nhas said he will sign for the league average of $2.6 million.\n\n   The timing question gets sticky if Gugliotta hesitates. If the\nSuns wait and he stays in Minnesota, they could lose other players\nwho interest them. The option is to divide $8 million for next\nseason between a couple of younger players.\n\n   If the option is youth, there are some possibilities under\ndiscussion, namely Golden State's Caffey and Miami's Barry.\n\n   The Suns also have a $1.75 million exception to the cap. They\nhave talked about veteran guard Terry Porter.\n\n   Other considerations are veteran center Divac and forward Joe\nSmith. Ainge said he is looking for a center and/or big forward to\ngo alongside Longley, whom the Suns will acquire today from Chicago\nfor Mark Bryant, Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and a conditional\ndraft pick.  \n","Headline":"\nSUNS TURN ATTENTION TO GUGLIOTTA \n","Text":["\n   With Antonio McDyess out of the picture, the Suns quickly turned\nto Plan B _ a full-court pursuit of free-agent forward Tom\nGugliotta.\n","\n   Gugliotta, a 6-foot-10 forward from the Minnesota Timberwolves,\nbecame the No. 1 priority when McDyess stung Suns management with\nhis return to the Denver Nuggets.\n","\n   ``We're not going to be specific about any names, but we expect\nto have some people on the horn, possibly in town, over the next\nday or two,'' said Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who was\nprohibited from identifying the free agents because of NBA lockout\nprohibitions that are scheduled to expire today at noon.\n","\n   The Suns' interest in Gugliotta hasn't been a secret since late\nlast season, but it's not clear whether the feeling is mutual.\nAccording to Suns sources, they were attempting to get him into\ntown today.\n","\n   Bryan Colangelo referred to Gugliotta Wednesday night as the\nthird player in ``The Big Three'' free agents.
