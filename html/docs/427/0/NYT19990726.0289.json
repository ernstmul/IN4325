Participants evaluated their smoking status, described\ntheir food habits and indicated their intentions of changing their\neating and smoking habits.\n\n   After three years, the surveys were taken again for a control\ngroup and at companies that provided improved access to nutrition\ninformation and more fruits and vegetables and other low-fat,\nhigh-fiber menus. The group with the healthy workplace program\nshowed the greater improvement in eating habits.\n\n   Group members were also more likely to report support from\nco-workers for choosing low-fat diets and they believed that\nmanagement cared about their nutrition. But follow-up responses for\nsmoking were similar in both groups.\n\n   ``What is really significant about this paper is that it shows\nthe importance of addressing the environment that people find\nthemselves in,'' said Dr. Lois Biener, senior research fellow at\nthe Center for Survey Research at the University of Massachusetts\nat Boston and lead author of the study. It appears in the current\nissue of Health Education and Behavior.\n\n   ``The traditional way of addressing behavior issues is to try to\nhelp individuals to change, but people have to exist in a social\nworld and if a lot of people around you are involved in unhealthy\nbehaviors, it's really difficult to make those changes,'' Biener\nsaid.\n\n   Participating companies ranged in size from 49 to 1,700 workers,\nwith an average size of 316.\n\n   The Robbins Company, in Attleboro, Mass., with 430 employees,\nwas enthusiastic about its results.\n\n   ``Our people spend a great amount of time at the company,'' said\nCharles Dress, the human resources director. ``If they are going to\nbe doing that, we have to ask ourselves what can we do to make\ntheir lives better, different and healthier? And from a corporate\nperspective, if our workers are healthier, benefits stay reasonable\nand there's less stress and greater productivity.''\n\n   _ALISHA BERGER\n\n   TIMING: YEAR'S FIRST BABY? ON WHOSE WATCH?\n\n   Earlier this year, some obstetricians said that April 9 was the\nprime date for couples hoping to conceive the first baby born on\nJan. 1, 2000.\n\n   Many people apparently took the advice to heart, encouraged by\nspecial deals from hotels, contests and, perhaps, the belief that a\nmaternity ward is as good a place as any to spend the last New\nYear's Eve of the 1900s, since every other establishment of note\nhas long since been booked.\n\n   All of this got two London pediatricians thinking.
