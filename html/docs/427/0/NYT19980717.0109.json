{"DocumentId":"NYT19980717.0109","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"0","Body":" BC-MOVIE-BROADWAY-BOS \nGAY LOVE IS BLAND IN `BROADWAY DAMAGE' \n\n  \n For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By RENEE GRAHAM  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \nBROADWAY DAMAGE \nWritten and directed by: Victor Mignatti \nStarring: Mara Hobel, Michael Shawn Lucas, Hugh Panaro, Aaron\nWilliams \nRunning time: 110 minutes \n \n\n   ``Broadway Damage'' is a lot like its main characters _ pleasant\nand inoffensive, with not a lasting thought in its pretty little\nhead.\n\n   Victor Mignatti's fanciful film is a New York fairy tale\ndisguised as a romantic comedy. How else to explain the fact that\nMarc (Michael Shawn Lucas) and his best galpal Cynthia (Mara Hobel)\nmanage to find a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village for\nunder $2,000 a month, let alone under $1,000? Even if you have sex\nwith the building's superintendent, which Marc does, you\nain't      getting a Village apartment with running water, functioning\nappliances, and a private bathroom for anything things less than\n$10,000 under the table, and perhaps your firstborn.\n\n   But ``Broadway Damage'' isn't as interested in reality as in the\ntelling of this blandly sweet gay romance.\n\n   Marc is an aspiring actor, who can't seem to land any work\nbecause casting directors find him to soft (read: too gay). His\nnebbishy best friend Robert (Aaron Williams) is also an actor and a\nmusician who has a major love jones for Marc. But he believes the\nhunky blond is simply out of his romantic league. Robert isn't\nnearly as much of a goober as he thinks he is, but he needs to lose\nthe glasses, Garanimals clothing, and shaggy bangs.\n\n   But what chance does Robert stand with a guy magnet like Marc,\nwho attracts the amorous attention of his musician neighbor David\n(Hugh Panaro). If David seems too good to be true, of course, he\nis. But the film never betrays its good, boring heart or its\ninevitable happy ending. The untrustworthy David is never more than\nan attractive nuisance; one look at Robert's lovelorn eyes in\nMarc's presence, and you know exactly who will end up with whom.\n\n   Meanwhile, Cynthia is a Long Island rich kid determined to make\nher way without Daddy's money, although she spends what little she\nhas at Bloomingdale's and any other store still willing to accept\nher overworked credit cards. To his credit, Mignatti allows Hobel's\nCynthia to be more than Marc's zaftig het friend. She actually gets\na love scene with a marriage-minded boyfriend, and there's a\nrunning gag about her increasingly desperate attempts to reach Tina\nBrown, then editor of The New Yorker, for a job.\n\n   ``Broadway Damage'' is terrible. We've seen all this before, and\nit's usually been better. Disappointingly, what Mignatti ends up\nwith is a genteel gay comedy when he needed a few more sharp\nelbows.\n","Headline":"\nGAY LOVE IS BLAND IN `BROADWAY DAMAGE' \n","Text":["\n   ``Broadway Damage'' is a lot like its main characters _ pleasant\nand inoffensive, with not a lasting thought in its pretty little\nhead.\n","\n   Victor Mignatti's fanciful film is a New York fairy tale\ndisguised as a romantic comedy.
