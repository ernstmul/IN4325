The first written\nreference to spectacles is in his ``Opus majus,'' published in\n1268.\n\n   But many historians attribute the discovery to monks in northern\nItaly. In Pisa, a Dominican monk, Alessandro della Spina, was\nmaking reading glasses at the end of the 13th century. The Chinese\nhad spectacles in the 13th century as well, but they were used to\nshade eyes from the sun rather than to aid vision.\n\n   With the rise of the Venetian glass industry in the 14th\ncentury, glass lenses began to replace quartz. The invention of the\nprinting press in the 1450s, the subsequent spread of books and the\nrise of literacy increased the demand for reading glasses.\nEyeglasses were commonly sold on the streets in the 16th century,\nand professional guilds developed to control quality.\n\n   The original spectacles were only for the farsighted.

The pieces evolved\ninto wires long enough to hook over the ear when wigs went out of\nstyle in the 19th century, Handley said.\n\n   Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with the invention of\nbifocals. But London eyeglass makers were experimenting with the\nidea of fusing two lenses as early as 1760, according to Dr. Alvin\nand Virginia B.

At the end of the 19th century,\nthe first contact lenses were made of glass and covered the whites\nas well as the iris. They were uncomfortable and could not be worn\nfor more than a few hours.\n\n   Plastic lenses were developed in the 1930s, and by 1939,\nHollywood movie makers were using contact lenses to change the\ncolor of actors' eyes or to produce special effects like making\nsomeone look like an alien.\n\n   The prototype for corneal lenses, which cover only the center of\nthe eye, was first developed by the American lens technician Kevin\nTuohy in 1948. His lenses rode on a thin layer of tears, and were\nmore comfortable than the larger ones that covered the white.\n\n   In the late 1950s, a Czech chemist, Otto Wichterle, invented a\nsoft, water-absorbing plastic that seemed suitable for contacts.
