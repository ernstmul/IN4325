NORMAN  \n c.1999 Discover magazine  \n\n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)     \n\n   My friend Bill Cook, a primary care physician, called me one\nmorning.\n\n   ``I've admitted a patient, a 28-year-old woman,'' he said.\n``She's losing her skin. Can you come and take a look at her?''\n\n   He explained that the patient, Mary Grove, had come to his\noffice the day before, complaining that her skin had suddenly begun\nto peel. She felt strange _ weak and tender _ and her eyes and\nmouth felt irritated.\n\n   I am a dermatologist, and from Bill's description I had a good\nidea of what was wrong with Mary.\n\n   I found Mary in her bed, staring at the flickering images on the\nTV. When I introduced myself she smiled and said, ``Hey.''\n\n   ``I'd like to take a look at your skin,'' I said, ``if that's\nOK.''\n\n   ``What's left of it,'' she offered.\n\n   Her skin was a blanket of red. The top layer was sloughing off\nher face, neck, trunk, legs and feet in large sheets like wet\nwallpaper. Scattered over her body were a few islands of\nnormal-looking skin.\n\n   I had seen two other patients with this disorder, but neither of\nthis severity. To determine the extent of the damage, I took a look\nat the mucous membranes of her mouth, genitals and eyes.\n\n   ``Whaddaya think, Doctor?'' she slurred. Apparently, she was\ngroggy from her pain medications.\n\n   ``It appears that you've had a fairly severe reaction to a\nmedicine you took,'' I said. ``It doesn't happen very often, but\nwhen it does, it can be a real challenge to care for. But we're\ngoing to make sure you get the care you need to recover. Have you\ntaken any medicines in the last few weeks?''\n\n   ``I take something for my knees. It's like a pain pill, but it\nnever gave me a problem before.''\n\n   ``Anything else?''\n\n   She paused, her eyes focusing somewhere on the ground. ``I did\nhave an earache, and I took something I found in my cabinet. I'd\nhave to check it. I remember one of the kids or somebody used it\nwhen they had an infection and it helped, so I took it for a few\ndays.''\n\n   Do you remember the last time you had a minor burn? Do you\nremember how a small part of your skin peeled off? The same\nreaction extended all across Mary's body. But Mary's injury hadn't\nbeen caused by anything external, like a burn. The mutiny arose\nfrom within.\n\n   I explained to Mary that she was probably suffering an extreme\nand unusual allergic reaction to one of the drugs she had taken.\nHer immune system, for unknown reasons, viewed it as an enemy and\ninitiated a defense against it. The reaction _ called toxic\nepidermal necrolysis, or TEN _ is poorly understood, but the\ndevastation of the skin resembles burn injuries.\n\n   ``We need to watch you very carefully over the next several days\nto make sure you don't get an infection or lose too much of your\nvital fluids,'' I explained.\n\n   I took a sample of skin and sent it to a pathologist. Then I\nexplained to Mary's nurse the care she would need and called Bill\nCook to put together a treatment plan. We would stabilize her in\nthe internal medicine unit of our hospital and then closely monitor\nher condition.\n\n   On the second day of her hospitalization, I got back the\npathologist's report, which confirmed my diagnosis. On the third\nday of hospitalization, we moved Mary to the burn unit, where the\nstaff is trained to care for patients with severe skin loss. They\ncarefully removed the dead skin and applied a loose gauze dressing\nsaturated with antibacterial agents to the denuded skin surface.\n\n   The staff made sure she was getting enough fluids and nutrients\nand carefully monitored her fluid intake and urine output. They\nalso kept a close watch on her general condition and vital signs.\n\n   Mary was one of about 500 cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in\nthe United States each year.\n\n   Although the disorder is considered rare, its frequency may be\nunderestimated because mild cases probably go unreported. Most\nreported cases, like Mary's, pop up one to three weeks after a new\ndrug is taken. The onset is rapid and in some cases can be terribly\nsevere. Patients can lose their entire epidermis _ the uppermost of\nthe skin's three layers _ within about 24 hours.\n\n   The greatest threat to patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis\nis not the damage to the skin itself but the manner in which that\ndamage increases a patient's vulnerability to infection. When the\nepidermis is destroyed, the body surface is a standing invitation\nto pathogens. Roughly 30 percent of patients diagnosed with TEN die\n_ most often because infection has spread into their bloodstreams.\n\n   Mary was, in this respect, fortunate. Her internal symptoms were\nlimited to some inflammation in her mouth. A topical ointment\nhelped heal and anesthetize the tender inflamed sites.\n\n   The prognosis for TEN depends on how quickly the disorder is\ndiagnosed and treated. The peak of the disease (by the third day,\nin Mary's case) bears the highest threat, and the fate of the\npatient often hangs in the balance for one or more weeks.\n\n   Nearly half of the surviving patients have residual and\npotentially disabling eye lesions, which can include scarring of\nthe cornea.\n\n   Mary's chances for recovery were good, given that we identified\nand treated the disorder quickly. After a week in the hospital Mary\nimproved, and within a month she was up and around.\n\n   Her eyes appeared to have been spared any chronic harm. She bore\nonly a slight visible trace of the vast tissue destruction: a small\nspot of scar tissue on her left thigh.\n\n   _______  \n\n     (Robert A.
