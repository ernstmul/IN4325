And sun\nis the major cause _ along with cigarette smoke _ of premature\naging. Photoaging is what sun damage is called. The results are\nbrown sun spots, collagen collapse and deep lines and wrinkles.\n\n   Funny thing, though. Sun damage is almost totally avoidable,\njust by taking certain precautions: Stay out of direct sun when you\ncan and use sunscreen or sunblock to keep harmful ultraviolet\nradiation from doing a little toxic dance on your skin.\n\n   A number of dermatologists in this country have spent hours in\nthe lab, seeking ways to prevent sun damage and mitigate existing\nproblems.\n\n   One of them is Dr. Sheldon Pinnell, 62, the J. Lamar Callaway\nProfessor of Dermatology at Duke University in North Carolina. He\nis the medical and scientific adviser to the SkinCeuticals skin\ncare line which specializes in topical Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid)\nskin products, including a line of moisturizers with sunblock.\n\n   I am very reluctant to recommend any kind of beauty product. But\nSkinCeuticals' moisturizers with sunblock are such good products\nwith no serious downsides that I can't resist.\n\n   SkinCeuticals is not the kind of line you will find on counters\nat department stores. It is one you will find at your\ndermatologist's office or facialist's salon.\n\n   But so many preparations, particularly the ``organic''\nsunscreens, can be very occlusive (pore-clogging). The culprit in\nthis case is OMC or oroxymetho-oxycinnimate, an ingredient in most\nover-the-counter products.\n\n   If you have small pores or sensitive skin, this ingredient,\nwhich screens out the harmful short ultraviolet rays that cause\nsunburn, or UVBs, can make your skin break out. The ``physical''\nblockers, usually Parsol (avobenzone) and titanium dioxide, are\ndesigned to screen out the more insidious, longer ultraviolet rays,\nthe UVAs (or the ``agers.'') But they don't block out everything.\n\n   In the past two or three years, the one physical blocker that\nhas taken care of both UVA and UVB rays is a product called Z-Cote,\na transparent form of zinc oxide, the noxious white stuff that\nlifeguards wear on their noses. Pinnell and his research team have\nbeen working with Z-Cote and as a result, SkinCeuticals put it in\ntheir combination moisturizer and sunblock.\n\n   ``I don't tell people to stay out of the sun,'' Pinnell said in\na telephone interview. ``If you tell people that, they'll think\nyou're nuts. People feel better when they've been in the sun. So I\nam interested in people being able to be in the sun if they have a\nway of protecting themselves.''\n\n   Pinnell said there were three things to remember about getting\nsun exposure: ``The most important thing (for) protection is the\nright clothing. Stay covered up. Secondly, stay out of the noonday\nsun. If you're out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., you've\navoided 80 percent of the UVB radiation and 70 percent of the\nUVA.''\n\n   The third step is wear sunblock on your face, hands, ears, the\nback of your neck and on the line of bare scalp where you part your\nhair.\n\n   SkinCeuticals products include a very high concentration of\nZ-Cote. ``We're pushing the limits,'' Pinnell said. ``With SPF 30\nin the Ultimate Sun Defense (cream), it protects people who are at\nvery high risk.''\n\n   You're in this category if you are of Irish-English extraction\nwith white-white skin and freckles, or anyone with sensitive skin\nor skin that sunburns easily.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   What I particularly like about this line is that the two\nproducts, one with SPF 20 and the other with SPF 30, go on easily,\ndon't cause skin eruptions and provide a smooth base for foundation\nmakeup. Another plus: Unlike sunscreen products that wash off when\nyou swim or sweat, these creams do not need reapplication every two\nhours.\n\n   Pinnell's other contribution to the SkinCeuticals line is the\nVitamin C or antioxidant products. His team at Duke University\nfound that L-ascorbic acid is the only form of Vitamin C that our\nbodies can actually absorb through the skin and use. Since the body\ncannot store Vitamin C, Pinnell and others have worked to develop a\ntopical formula that would allow Vitamin C to penetrate and protect\nthe skin.\n\n   How does this work?\n\n   ``When light hits the skin,'' Pinnell said, ``it bombards the\ntissue and you have more damage than the body can repair or protect\nagainst.''\n\n   With products like SkinCeuticals' Vitamin C and sun-care lines,\ndamage from the sun can be kept at a minimum. In some cases, these\nhigh-tech antioxidant products have reversed minor sun damage and\npromote collagen production.\n\n   To my mind, these products are ushering in a new age of hope in\na jar and truly are miracle creams.\n","Headline":"\nBEAUTY AND THE BEAST: HOW TO PROTECT THE SKIN FROM SUN'S RAYS \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the missive that wandered around the Internet\nlast year, one of the gems of life-advice was: ``Wear your\nsunscreen.''\n","\n   Wise words (they were falsely attributed to Kurt Vonnegut as his\ncommencement address to Vassar College, and actually written by a\nChicago-based journalist), given that skin cancer rates are\nincreasing at the rate of four percent a year, and one person in\nevery six will have some form of skin cancer during the course of\ntheir lives.\n","\n   Sun is a major risk factor for skin cancer and melanoma.
