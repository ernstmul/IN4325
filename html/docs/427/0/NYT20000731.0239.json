Astronomers at the University of Arizona and\nthe Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory have determined that the\nsmall object, thought to be an asteroid when it was discovered near\nJupiter last year, is in fact an outer satellite of the planet.\n\n   The object was one of many observed by the University of\nArizona's Spacewatch program, which uses a 36-inch telescope to\nlook for comets and asteroids. It was cataloged by the\nSmithsonian's Minor Planet Center and pretty much forgotten.\n\n   But a staff member of the center, testing new software last\nmonth, thought he came across another observation of the object in\nthe Spacewatch data. He tried to come up with a solar orbit for the\nobject that would account for the various observations. When he\ncould not, it dawned on him that perhaps he was wrongly assuming\nthat the object was orbiting the Sun. Perhaps it was actually\norbiting Jupiter.\n\n   That turned out to be the case, although its orbit, like those\nof the other outer satellites, is highly irregular and millions of\nmiles from the planet. And the object is so small _ about three\nmiles in diameter, perhaps _ that it is difficult to see. But the\nastronomers hope to make another set of observations to confirm\ntheir finding. And if it is confirmed as a moon, 1999 UX18 will\neventually get a name worthy of its billing.\n\n   Undoing Fish Evolution\n\n   Astyanax mexicanus, a fish found in Mexico, is an unusual\ncreature. It exists in two forms: sightless cave dwellers that have\ndegenerate orbs in place of eyes, and those that live in surface\nstreams and have normal eyes. The two are thought to have diverged\nfrom a common ancestor within the past million years.\n\n   Now, scientists at the University of Maryland have uncovered\nclues to how they evolved differently. They report in the journal\nScience that the eye lens plays a critical role in the development\n(or degeneration) of the eye.\n\n   In the cave-dwelling variety, eyes begin to develop in the\nembryo, but the lens quickly degenerates and other eye tissues like\nthe cornea, retina and pupil develop in only rudimentary form. But\nwhen the researchers implanted lens tissue from the sighted variety\ninto a cave-dweller embryo, a large eye with a distinct cornea,\npupil and iris developed. It is as if the researchers were able to\nundo a million years of evolution in one fell swoop.\n\n   The researchers are conducting further experiments to determine\nexactly how the lens tissue sets off eye development. The work may\neventually help in understanding the genetic factors behind certain\nforms of sight loss in humans.\n\n   Those Talkative Beans\n\n   It's hard to find something nice to say about lima beans, other\nthan that they are easy to spear with a fork. But researchers in\nJapan have uncovered a reason the vegetable may be worthy of new\nrespect. Limas, it turns out, are good communicators.\n\n   Like some other types of plants, a lima can let its neighbors\nknow when it has been attacked by a pest such as a spider mite. The\naction of the mite munching on the plant releases volatile\ncompounds that are carried through the air to neighboring lima\nplants, which then prepare chemical defenses against infestation.\n\n   While it had been known that limas could do this, the exact\nmechanism had remained unclear.
