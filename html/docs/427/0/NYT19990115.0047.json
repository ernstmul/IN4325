THIS IS PART TWO.\n      RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.\n      Georgia man's battle to regain his eyesight provides inspiration\nfor big-screen romance\n      By Lillian Lee Kim\n      c. 1999 Cox News Service\n\n   ATLANTA_The day after surgery, Woodhams removed the eye patch.\nInstead of reacting with joy, Jennings was dazed. Undoubtedly he\ncould see, but he obviously was experiencing a tremendous sensory\noverload.\n\n   ``I was trying to figure out what everything was,'' he said.\n\n   ``I had no idea what to do,'' Barbara Jennings said. ``People\nexpected him to be fully sighted immediately.''\n\n   Those sensory difficulties worsened, despite a second operation\nseveral weeks later that removed the cataract from the left eye. At\n20/80 or 20/100, Jennings' eyesight wasn't perfect. This didn't\naccount, however, for his inability to visually recognize even\nfamiliar things, such as his cat, unless he touched them. Woodhams\nbegan to realize the problem was rooted in Jennings' brain, not his\neyes.\n\n   Mrs. Jennings' father called Sacks, whose work in neurology was\nwell-known through his book ``Awakenings,'' about catatonic\npatients who were temporarily reanimated by drug treatments.\nIntrigued, Sacks and an ophthalmologist friend, Dr. Robert\nWasserman, came to Atlanta to examine Jennings.\n\n   Wasserman and Woodhams concluded Jennings had been incorrectly\ndiagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa and speculated his initial\nblindness may have been caused by congenital retinal problems as\nwell as nerve damage from his childhood bout with meningitis. The\ncataracts had developed later.\n\n   As for Jennings' problems incorporating sight into his other\nsenses, the doctors decided he would simply have to learn\neverything from the beginning, as infants do.\n\n   ``The eyes and ears in themselves work automatically. But that's\nnot enough,'' Sacks explained. ``What the ears and eyes provide is\nonly the beginning of a long process of images that has to be\ndigested and processed and incorporated and remembered.''\n\n   Jennings' learning process ended abruptly.\n\n   It had been an eventful, stressful year for Shirl and Barbara\nJennings. Between his two eye operations, they were married in a\nbig church wedding, just a few months after their reunion. He\neyesight was overwhelming him, and he often reverted to his blind\nhabits and relied on touch.\n\n   Then a series of devastating blows struck. In February 1992,\nJennings was rushed to the hospital with pneumonia, which led to\nrespiratory failure that starved his brain of oxygen.\n\n   Despite supplemental oxygen, he periodically lost consciousness,\nand his sight virtually vanished. It returned to some degree as he\nrecovered, but never near the acuity immediately following the\noperations.\n\n   Jennings' illness left him disabled and he lost his cherished\njob at the YMCA. Shortly afterward, the Jenningses also lost their\nhome: As an employee, he had been living with his wife in a\nYMCA-owned house near the facility. After a frantic house search,\nthey moved to Conyers.\n\n   ``So that first year was a little rugged,'' Mrs. Jennings said.\n``There was a lot of depression there. He never expected that at\nall. He just thought he would see.''\n\n   Again, Jennings' illness had robbed him of sight. He could still\nidentify colors, detect movement and distinguish bright lights, but\nhe was essentially, if not blind, seriously visually handicapped.\n\n   ``It was interesting and sad,'' remarked Woodhams. ``But at the\nsame time you felt relieved he was losing his sight.'' The\npressures of entering the sighted world had been too much.\n\n   In 1996, despite his failing sight, Jennings began taking\npainting lessons. One of his paintings, an abstract work dominated\nby his favorite color, blue, is featured in ``At First Sight.''\n\n   Jennings doesn't use a cane, but he does brush his fingertips\nagainst the wall when he walks, slowly, down the hallway of his\ncluttered home. He may walk hesitantly, but when he massages, he is\nconfident and at ease.\n\n   ``Someone told me I have hands like a surgeon,'' he said. They\nare incredibly strong, yet gentle hands, and he wields them\nskillfully. They know where to find tension knots, how to relax\ntight muscles, how to soothe.\n\n   Doctors believe Jennings' sight is irretrievable. The removal of\nthe cataracts that had shrouded his retinas for so long actually\nmay have contributed to further damage, by allowing ultraviolet\nrays to penetrate the pupil. His extended respiratory illness,\nwhich lowered the oxygen levels in his blood, probably also was a\nfactor.\n\n   Despite the chaos of that first year, the Jenningses'\nrelationship remains solid.\n\n   ``I've had to develop monstrous quantities of patience,'' Mrs.\nJennings said, and this time her eyes do twinkle. ``I am still a\n24-hour sighted guide, and I always will be. Unless he gets a\n(seeing-eye) dog.''\n\n   ``They move too quickly for me,'' Jennings quipped.\n\n   The couple plan to launch a Web site soon to advertise their\nartwork _ his paintings and her egg art. She has painted eggs,\nincluding enormous ostrich eggs, for 20 years and last year created\nthe Georgia entry for the White House Easter Egg Exhibition.\n\n   The couple have enjoyed the hoopla created by the movie,\nespecially meeting and mingling with stars Sorvino and Kilmer.
