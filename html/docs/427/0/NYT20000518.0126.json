Then there are the shades, umbrellas and clothing\noffering an even stronger defense.\n\n   Ask your dermatologist for advice and he's likely to tell you\nthat if you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors, you should take\nprecautions. Then he'll remind you that prolonged exposure to the\nsun's rays is harmful. In the short term, you'll suffer a painful\nsunburn. Over time, you could develop skin cancer, certain forms of\nwhich, if unchecked, can be fatal.\n\n   Scared? Confused? Don't be. Experts say protecting your skin\nfrom the sun's damaging rays is simple. Choose a strong product\nwith a reliable brand name and use your skin as your indicator.\n\n   ``My rule of thumb is that if you're using a sunscreen now and\nyou're still getting tan or red, it's not doing what you want it to\ndo,'' said Dr. Andrew Kaufman of the Center for Dermatology Care in\nThousand Oaks. ``You're either using a sunscreen that isn't giving\nyou the SPF protection you need, or you're not putting on enough,\nor not frequently enough.''\n\n   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is trying to\nsimplify matters by eliminating sunscreen labels with Sun\nProtection Factor (SPF) levels higher than 30 since the higher\noptions, they say, do not offer significantly better protection\nthan the others. By the end of 2002, every product stronger than\nSPF 30 will carry the label 30+ and labels with phrases such as\n``all-day protection'' and ``waterproof'' will disappear.\n\n   Whatever you use, skin specialists say, use a lot of it and use\nit often, and don't forget to coat the kids in the stuff as well.\n\n   A study conducted by Dr. June Robinson of Loyola University _\npublished in this month's Journal of the American Academy of\nDermatology _ concludes that parents who use sunscreen on their\nchildren tend to let them play in the sun for longer periods of\ntime, thereby negating the benefits of sunscreen.\n\n   It's these same parents, the study says, who aren't using enough\nsunscreen on their own skin, thereby setting a poor example for the\nkids.\n\n   ``These are parents who are trying to protect their children,\nmore so than themselves,'' said Robinson, adding that parents also\nforget to cover all parts of their children's bodies such as the\ntops of the hands and feet. ``They're trying hard, but they haven't\nquite figured out how to carry the ball into the end zone.''\n\n   Once you get past the SPF number _ which represents the amount\nof protection a product offers against harmful ultraviolet B rays _\ngo for what feels comfortable. Some people like a gel, spray or\nroll-on; others prefer an oily lotion. Some like the standard\nsquirt bottle, while others prefer a pump bottle for strategic\nplacement. For kids, there are now several brands of sunscreen that\nslather or spray on in a bright color, such as blue or green, to\nhelp prevent parents from missing a spot. The color fades as the\nsunscreen is rubbed into the skin.\n\n   Regardless of what protective product you use, skin doctors say\nyou should use it repeatedly. After you swim or sweat, slather it\non anew.\n\n   L.A. County lifeguards issue their employees copious amounts of\nSPF 30 sunscreen, but most lifeguards use their own, says Capt.\nSteve Moseley of the lifeguard's community service division.\n\n   ``I prefer the greasy Aloe Gator because I know it's on there,''\nsaid Moseley. ``Some don't like it !ital!because it's greasy.''\n\n   Lifeguards have long been aware of the dangers of prolonged\nexposure to sun rays. Which is why, he said, you're more likely to\nsee a lifeguard with more covered than the average ray-soakers.\n\n   ``The idea of the bronze sun god has kind of gone by the\nwayside,'' said Moseley, adding that a couple of lifeguards have\ndied from the effects of skin cancer. ``We've become a lot more\nconscious and aware _ more hats, more long-sleeved shirts.''\n\n   Clothing certainly helps. On the beach, skimpy may be stylish,\nbut for health purposes, you're better off covering up with items\nlike hats, shirts and sunglasses. Clothes should have a tight\nweave. Hold your T-shirt up to the sun. If light passes through,\nit's not giving good protection. The Washington-based clothing\nmanufacturer Sun Precautions produces a line of clothing, called\nSolumbra, that has a 30+ SPF factor built into the fabric. Company\npresident Shaun Hughes, who founded Solumbra after being diagnosed\nwith skin cancer at the age of 26, claims his clothing line offers\nbetter protection than a 30+ SPF sunscreen.\n\n   Sunless tanners, aka ``tan-in-a-can'' will work as long as you\ntake the ``sunless'' part of the label literally. They'll give you\na layer of color through a chemical called dihydroxyacetone, but\nthey won't protect you from the sun.\n\n   ``Some of them do have SPF levels built into them, but we say\nthat's a convenience for the aesthetics,'' said George A. Ziets,\nvice president of research and development for Bath & Body Works.\n``And the quality of the formulations is getting better on those.\nYou go back 20 years, they were very orange and streaky-looking.\nToday's are a lot more aesthetically elegant.''\n\n   If you can't stay out of the sun, be aware that the sun's rays\nare strongest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. And give\nyourself extended shade breaks if you're going to be out in the sun\nfor a long period of time. During the shade time, your skin can\nrecover, says Dr. David Chu, section chief of the division of\nmelanoma and surgery at City of Hope National Medical Center in\nDuarte.\n\n   ``It's not a complete repair, but I think it does make a\ndifference,'' Chu said. ``It's a pitfall that parents get into,\nthinking that sunscreen offers total protection from the sun. It's\nnot true.''\n","Headline":"\nARM YOURSELF WITH PROTECTION\n","Text":["\n   When did catching a few rays become so blasted complicated?\n","\n   There are the sunscreens, sunblocks and sunless tanning lotions,\nwith labels promising a veritable alphabet soup of SPFs and UV\nprotection.
