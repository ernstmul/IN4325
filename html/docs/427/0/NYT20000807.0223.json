Times News Service   \n\n   The quick fix of laser surgery may be freeing more people from\neyeglasses and contact lenses, but no matter how successful the\nsurgery, their liberation is only temporary. Sooner or later the\nneed for reading glasses descends on all adults _ and from those\ndevices there is still no quick escape.\n\n   Human bodies age at enormously different rates with one single\nexception: the fine-focus mechanism of the human eye. The lens of\nthe eye and the muscle that surrounds it tick away the passage of\ntime like tiny atomic clocks, slowly deteriorating with a precision\nso immutable that ophthalmologists say they can accurately estimate\npatients' ages to within a few years by measuring their ability to\nfocus close up.\n\n   The loss of close-up focus is known as presbyopia, from the\nGreek for ``elderly vision,'' but the process actually begins in\nvery young adulthood. Children with normal vision can focus on\nobjects an inch or so from their eyes, but they lose that ability\nas teen-agers, and by the age of 50 or so, when the eyes can focus\nno closer than a yard or two away, almost all adults in the world\nneed glasses to read newspapers or thread needles.\n\n   Those who claim they do not, researchers say, are simply\nunusually skilled at ``blur interpretation,'' fooled by good\nguesswork into thinking they are exceptions to a universal\nbiological rule.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   Presbyopia is thought to represent not so much a sign of\napproaching decrepitude as a leftover feature of primate life, when\nscanning for food or predators on the horizon was a more important\nsurvival task for adults than was any close-up work.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   Remarkably, for such a longstanding and uniform feature of human\nbiology, scientists are still not sure exactly what causes\npresbyopia or what might reverse it.\n\n   For the last five years, they have been arguing heatedly over\nthe risks and the merits of an experimental surgical procedure,\nscleral expansion surgery, that, despite a host of scientific\nobjections, appears to fix it.\n\n   ``It's extremely difficult to study the internal structures of\nthe eye,'' said Dr. Adrian Glasser, an expert in the physiology of\nthe eye at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Texas.\n``It's such a finely regulated organ that many of the technologies\nthat have been available to study it have in one way or other\ndisrupted the very thing we're trying to study.''\n\n   Dissections of human specimens have provided only partial\nsnapshots of the focusing process, while animal research is of\nlimited help because few animals focus the way humans do.\n\n   The lens of the eye is suspended in the eyeball right behind the\niris, connected by a halo of fibers to a ring of circular muscle.\nThe lens, the fibers and the muscle itself all show changes with\nthe passing years, but exactly which of these changes drives the\nloss of focusing ability is disputed.\n\n   The lens is the best-studied part of the system. A\nprotein-filled disk, it derives from the same type of cells as do\nthe skin and the hair and, like them, continues to grow throughout\nlife. Unlike other continuously growing structures, though, the\nlens cannot shed its older cells, or blindness would result.\nInstead, it slowly gets bigger and thicker, bulging forward into\nthe fluid-filled space that separates it from the iris.\n\n   According to the principles of optics, the bulging curvature\nshould make the lens focus better and better with advancing years.\nThe fact that exactly the opposite occurs means that other powerful\nfactors are operating too, and the clue to presbyopia lies with\nthem.\n\n   Many scientists think that the most important factors are the\nage-related changes that take place within the lens proteins,\nmaking the lens harder and less elastic with the years.\n\n   ``The proteins in the lens of an adult are decades old,'' said\nDr. Jane F. Koretz, a professor of biophysics at Rensselaer\nPolytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. ``They are even older than we\nare, because the first ones were laid down before we were born. In\nno other part of the body is that the case. Everything else gets\nreplaced.''\n\n   The protein molecules in the aging lens slowly change in ways\nthat make them bend light less, Koretz said. Although the elderly\nlens is more spherical, it is less and less able to focus light\nfrom nearby objects.\n\n   Age-related changes also take place in the muscles surrounding\nthe lens. Most scientists agree that these muscles do not become\nweak with age _ it would make no sense for one isolated muscle in\nthe body to slowly give out while all the others continue to work\nperfectly well. A recent study using high-resolution magnetic\nresonance to photograph the eye muscles confirmed that the muscles\nstill contracted powerfully in older people who could not focus up\nclose.\n\n   The geometry of the fibers connecting the muscle to the lens\nshifts as the lens grows with age, and the fibers themselves appear\nto harden and become less elastic, a process that also interferes\nwith the ability to focus.\n\n   Exercises purporting to ``strengthen'' the lens muscles are\npurposeless, Koretz said, since the muscles are already strong: it\nis their position and fibrous attachments that may hamper their\nability to move.\n\n   If not exercise, then, can any measures help the owner of two\naging eyes elude reading glasses?\n\n   Some people find that a satisfactory solution is the creation of\n``monovision,'' in which one eye is manipulated to focus well at\nreading distances (usually with a contact lens or an intraocular\nlens placed after cataract surgery), while the other focuses for\ndistance. People instinctively grow to favor one eye or the other\nfor different tasks. While some people are delighted with this\nsolution, Koretz said, others are plagued by dizziness or nausea,\nor miss the depth of vision they once had.\n\n   Finding a better fix for presbyopia is rapidly becoming the Holy\nGrail of experimental ophthalmology, especially as researchers and\nentrepreneurs begin to calculate the profits that might accrue from\ncuring an annoyance affecting every single adult in the population.\n\n   The basic disagreements as to why the process occurs have meant\nthat viable solutions are slow to emerge, and are extremely\ncontroversial when they do.\n\n   Among the most disputed to date is scleral expansion surgery, a\nprocedure devised by Dr. Ronald Schachar, a Texas ophthalmologist\nand physicist, in the early 1990s.\n\n   A maverick who has argued that much of what scientists think\nthey know about the focusing mechanism of the eye is actually\nuntrue, Schachar holds that presbyopia develops only because, as\nthe lens of the eye swells with age, the muscles and fibers\nsurrounding it grow lax, and the system can no longer work\neffectively.\n\n   By stretching the system out again, Schachar says, presbyopia\ncan be easily and permanently reversed. He claims to restore\ntension to the muscle and fibers by surgically implanting four\nsmall curved pieces of plastic in the white of the eye a few\nmillimeters from the iris, which, he says, re-establish an\neffective working distance between the lens muscles and the lens.\n\n   His technique has evoked howls of protest from physiologists who\npoint out that it ignores decades of solid experimental evidence\nimplicating age-related changes within the lens itself as key\ncauses of presbyopia.\n\n   ``The scientific community never took scleral expansion surgery\nseriously,'' Glasser said.\n\n   A few hundred patients who have volunteered for the surgery over\nthe last decade in Mexico, Canada and Europe have stymied the\nprocedure's critics with reports that the surgery does seem to\nrestore their ability to see up close.\n\n   In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved preliminary\ntrials of the operation at six sites in the United States,\nincluding the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in Manhattan, where\nDr. Barrie D.
