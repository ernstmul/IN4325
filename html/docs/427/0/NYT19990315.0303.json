Times News Service   \n\n   In spots, the depths of the sea teem with shrimp whose eyes are\nexquisitely adapted for life in a world of eternal darkness.\nExtraordinarily sensitive, the eyes can apparently see a diffuse\nlight given off by hot volcanic springs, around which the creatures\nfeed by the millions.\n\n   The light of the hot vents is far too faint to be detected by\nhuman eyes. But very sensitive cameras on occasion have captured\nits eerie glow.\n\n   Now, it turns out, human explorers of these dark ecosystems,\nworking in submersibles equipped with banks of strong floodlights,\nmay inadvertently be blinding swarms of the shrimps.\n\n   A team of three oceanographers in the March 11 issue of the\njournal Nature report evidence of blinding among deep-sea shrimp of\ntwo types, Rimicaris exoculata and Mirocaris fortunata. Diving in\nthe French submersible Nautile, the team collected the shrimp from\ntwo vent sites in the deep Atlantic.\n\n   Close examination of the creatures showed eye damage, at times\nsevere, and at times with a complete breakdown of eye-pigment\nmaterial.\n\n   ``The shrimp swarm over the vent chimneys and are illuminated by\nany vehicle working at the active region,'' the team said. ``There\nis at present no means of working at the vents without causing this\ndamage, so every vent population visited will already have been\nexposed to it.''\n\n   The team added that eyes were spared only among ``juvenile\nspecimens taken by trawling in midwater well above the vents.''\nThese shrimp would have escaped the floodlights down below.\n\n   The scientists reporting the findings are Peter Herring of the\nSouthampton Oceanography Center in Britain, and Edward Gaten and\nPeter Shelton of the University of Leicester.\n\n   Cindy Lee Van Dover, a deep-sea biologist at the College of\nWilliam and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., who has studied the shrimp\nand documented the vent glow, said in an interview that such damage\nhad long been suspected and was worth confirming.\n\n   ``We don't know that the shrimp use their eyes,'' she added.\n``We've never shown they have a visual response to light. But we\nthink that they're looking at ambient light from the vents,\nprobably to keep away from very hot water that would cook them.''\n\n   Dr. Van Dover said that submersibles with floodlights and\nscientific observers had been diving regularly on the Atlantic\nvents since 1985, and that the divers had never found any lessening\nof the shrimp populations, despite the repeated illuminations.\n\n   ``The shrimp are always there,'' she said. ``So the sense is\nthat the lights haven't blinded them to the point that it's\naffecting the population density. Individuals may be having their\neyes damaged, but in terms of the behavior and ecology of the\nsystem, we don't see any effects. If they had all disappeared, we\nwould have wondered.''\n\n   Despite the apparent lack of population damage, Dr. Van Dover\nsaid, a move is afoot among deep-sea scientists to protect some\nparts of the seabed from further exploration and potential damage\nby setting up deep sanctuaries that are off-limits to most\nresearch.\n\n   Most of the scientists, she added, have a favorite place that\nthey are eager to protect and preserve.\n","Headline":"\nDIVERS' FLOODLIGHTS MAY BLIND SHRIMP \n","Text":["\n   In spots, the depths of the sea teem with shrimp whose eyes are\nexquisitely adapted for life in a world of eternal darkness.\nExtraordinarily sensitive, the eyes can apparently see a diffuse\nlight given off by hot volcanic springs, around which the creatures\nfeed by the millions.\n","\n   The light of the hot vents is far too faint to be detected by\nhuman eyes.
