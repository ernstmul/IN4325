ALTMAN, M.D.   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   As a nurse holds the hands and head of one of the seven\nsurviving octuplets born in Houston in December, a doctor peers at\nthe back of the eyes through an ophthalmoscope. In assembly-line\nfashion, the eye doctor examines each child. The aim is to seek the\nearliest sign of a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity,\nor ROP, resulting from abnormal blood vessel growth, and to use a\nlaser to prevent a detached retina, which can cause blindness.\n\n   The octuplets were born nearly four months before the mother's\ndue date of April 1. Like other infants born many weeks too early,\nthey are at high risk of developing ROP in both eyes.\n\n   Of the 3.9 million babies born in the United States in 1996,\nabout 11 percent, or 400,000, were premature, up from 9.4 percent\nin 1984. Federal health officials attribute most of the rise to\nlarger numbers of multiple births, which increase the risk of\npre-term delivery. Many multiple births, like those of the\noctuplets, result from fertility drug treatment.\n\n   At the same time, medicine now can keep alive tiny babies who\nwould not have survived only a few years ago. Still, some become\nblind.\n\n   The surviving octuplets, who are now 10 weeks or older, remain\nat the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. The first was born on\nDec. 8 and the seven others on Dec. 20. All weighed less than 2\npounds at birth. The smallest, a girl named Odera who weighed 10.3\nounces, died on Dec. 26.\n\n   The seven survivors are doing well, hospital officials said,\nalthough four are in serious condition and three are still listed\nas critical. All but one are consuming a combination of formula and\nbreast milk. One is fed intravenously.\n\n   Nevertheless, the status of their eyesight is uncertain and will\nremain so until several weeks after they leave the hospital.\n\n   In late January, Dr. David K. Coats and his wife and\nophthalmological partner, Dr. Evelyn A. Paysse, began examining the\nsurviving octuplets periodically, as they would any infant born\nprematurely.\n\n   Coats spoke in interviews about the general nature of ROP, but\nnot about the findings in the surviving octuplets because their\nparents, Nkem Chukwu, the mother, and Iyke Louis Udobi, the father,\nwanted no disclosures about their babies' eyesight.\n\n   At least 55,000 babies born prematurely each year are at highest\nrisk for ROP, and an estimated 1,000 of them suffer severe visual\nimpairment or blindness from ROP. No one has precise figures, but\nthey would be much higher if pediatric ophthalmologists did not use\nlasers or a freezing technique to try to limit the damage in\naffected babies.\n\n   About 80 percent of tiny infants develop a mild form of ROP that\ngenerally will not impair vision, and 10 percent escape entirely.\nBut 10 percent do develop a severe enough form that threatens to\ncause blindness from a separation of the retina from the wall of\nthe eye. It is this fraction that requires treatment to prevent a\nretinal detachment.\n\n   The more premature babies are, the more likely ROP is to\ndevelop, making the odds much higher for two groups of the tiniest\npremature babies _ those with an estimated gestational age of 28\nweeks or less, and those with a birthweight of 3.3 pounds. Such\nbabies have up to a 35 percent risk of needing treatment to prevent\nblindness.\n\n   For a group of seven or eight babies who, like the octuplets,\nwere 25 to 27 weeks estimated gestational age at birth, the odds\nare that one or two of them will need treatment for ROP, Coats\nsaid.\n\n   ``The problem is you do not know which one will develop ROP,''\nCoats said.\n\n   The laser and freezing treatments, though usually successful in\npreventing blindness, involve an important trade-off. ``We tell\nparents that they are sacrificing varying but significant amounts\nof side vision to maintain what vision has already developed and to\nprevent total blindness,'' Coats said.\n\n   Most babies are born with about 20-400 vision, which generally\ndoes not become 20-20 until about age 6 months.\n\n   Babies born prematurely also are at risk for vision loss from\nother conditions like lazy eye. About 10 percent of the tiniest\nbabies will become extremely nearsighted and will have to wear\nglasses with lenses as thick as Coke bottles for life, beginning in\nthe first year.\n\n   Infants born months prematurely have immature eyes, and the\nblood vessels that nourish the retina are often absent. Normally,\nat about the fourth month of fetal life, blood vessels begin to\ngrow from the optic nerve in an orderly fashion until they reach\nthe outer limits of the retina. That usually occurs about the time\na full-term baby is born.\n\n   At best, the blood vessels will continue to grow normally,\nreaching the outer margins of the retina at term without requiring\ntreatment. But in some premature infants, development of blood\nvessels goes awry and results in ROP. A prevailing theory is that\nthe immature retina produces a chemical that stimulates growth of\nblood vessels. Why ROP does not develop earlier than a month after\nbirth is not well understood.\n\n   ROP is the new name for what was called retrolental fibroplasia\nabout 30 years ago. At that time, doctors were detecting the\ncondition in its most severe form, after the retina had detached.\nDoctors also discovered that the blindness resulted from a baby's\nbeing given excessive amounts of oxygen. Doctors still believe that\noxygen plays a role, but they can better control the amount. And\nthey know that laser and freezing can prevent the retinal\ndetachment.\n\n   The test to detect infants whose eyes show the most severe,\nabnormal growth patterns, begins with a drop of a dilating drug in\neach eye. An hour later, the ophthalmologist adds a drop of local\nanesthetic to minimize the infant's discomfort during the\nexamination.\n\n   Looking through an ophthalmoscope, Coats determines the maturity\nof the retina by examining the optic nerve, which is a direct\nextension of the brain, and other areas. Then he looks at the blood\nvessels, studying their width and growth pattern and looking at how\nfar they have spread. He must also determine if there is a smooth\ntransition from the areas without blood vessels to those with them,\nas it should be, or if there is a sharp border, as it should not.\n\n   In reporting damage, the doctor describes it as on a clock: He\nmay pinpoint a problem between ``one and three o'clock.'' At the\nend of the examination, Coats checks the infant's eye muscle\nmovements and reaction to a bright light. The examination takes a\nfew minutes.\n\n   If the blood vessel growth is normal, Coats checks again every\nweek or so until the retina matures and the child is no longer at\nrisk for ROP.\n\n   But if the blood vessel growth pattern goes awry, and the baby\nis at high risk for developing irreversible blindness, treatment is\nstarted within three days.\n\n   In the past, ophthalmologists relied on written notes and their\nmemories in following the progress of development. Now Coats sets a\nspecial camera made by the Massie Research Co., in Dublin, Calif.,\non top of the baby's eye and obtains photographs that are about the\nsame quality as what he sees through an ophthalmoscope.\n\n   Treatment is recommended when the ophthalmologist sees abnormal\ngrowth of blood vessels in at least five contiguous, or eight\nnon-contiguous, hour zones.\n\n   Doctors can choose between two therapies, either a laser or\nfreezing technique. Neither treatment is aimed at the abnormal\nblood vessels, but at the retina that has not yet developed a blood\nsupply.\n\n   Each procedure takes from 45 to 90 minutes. It can be done by\nthe bedside or in the operating room under general anesthesia to\navoid dealing with a moving or crying child.\n\n   Using a laser, Coats flashes a beam on the retina from 500 to\n2,000 times in each eye, depending on the severity of the\ncondition. The laser beam is directed in a full circle at the\nperipheral retina with the hope of stopping production of the\nchemical growth factor.\n\n   In the freezing technique, known as cryotherapy, the\nophthalmologist inserts a device along the side of the eye and the\nbone, pushing it until it reaches the retina in the back of the\neye. Then the doctor continually freezes the retina until the\nentire outer section of the retina is treated. The procedure does\nnot harm the muscle, sclera and other eye tissues.\n\n   After treatment, a child with severe ROP will be left with only\na small amount of normal retina and a less severely affected baby\nwith a larger area. Laser or cryotherapy is generally a one-time\napplication. But treatment a second time is needed in about 5\npercent of infants.\n\n   ``We don't have a cure for this disease,'' Coats said. ``We have\nan intervention, which will usually result in a good visual\noutcome, but not always.''\n\n   Despite treatment, about 12 percent of treated infants develop a\nretinal detachment in one or both eyes. In general, the more\npremature the baby, the more likely the outcome will be poor.\n\n   If the retina detaches, doctors will perform other procedures to\nreattach it. But, at best, such procedures restore only partial\nvision.\n","Headline":"\nTHE DOCTOR'S WORLD: STAVING OFF BLINDNESS IN THE TINIEST OF\nINFANTS \n","Text":["\n   As a nurse holds the hands and head of one of the seven\nsurviving octuplets born in Houston in December, a doctor peers at\nthe back of the eyes through an ophthalmoscope.
