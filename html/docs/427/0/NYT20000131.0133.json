Kennebeck, an optometrist\npracticing in Kansas City from the 1930s to the 1970s, and if you\ncan provide details about his treatment technique, call Joseph\nMiele in New Jersey at (732) 671-5550. He is gathering information\nfrom former patients in an attempt to piece together Kennebeck's\nmethodology.\n\n   Joseph J. Kennebeck may have been onto something.\n\n   From the 1930s to the 1970s, Kennebeck practiced optometry in\nKansas City, but his methods were different from those used by most\noptometrists then or now. He believed he could improve vision or at\nleast prevent further losses by putting patients through a regimen\nof eye exercises and teaching them a different way of reading.\n\n   Kennebeck died in 1977, but not before putting his thoughts into\na book titled Why Eyeglasses Are Harmful for Children and Young\nPeople.\n\n   Theories similar to Kennebeck's have come in and out of vogue\nover the years. And now a group of optometrists from across the\ncountry is seeking former patients and colleagues who could shed\nlight on the sort of unorthodox work done by Kennebeck.\n\n   Joseph Miele is one of them.\n\n   ``There's a whole group of people who are interested in the kind\nof things Kennebeck was trying to do,'' said Miele, who practices\noptometry in Middletown, N.J.\n\n   The ideas being explored, he said, are similar to the ones\nKennebeck used decades ago in his practice downtown and, later, on\nthe Country Club Plaza and in Brookside.\n\n   Kennebeck's daughter, Sister Rose Joseph Kennebeck, is with the\nBenedictine order in Nauvoo, Ill. She worked in her father's office\na couple of summers in the 1940s and remembers patients ``from all\nover the United States'' who would come for treatment of\nnearsightedness, farsightedness and crossed eyes.\n\n   Although she is fuzzy on the particulars of his approach, she\nthinks he usually began by lobbying his patients to give up their\nglasses. She says her father had boxes and boxes filled with\ndiscarded spectacles.\n\n   His theory, as she recalls, was that he could strengthen eyes by\nforcing them to focus without glasses. She remembers seeing 30\npersons at a time seated in the office with various lenses over\ntheir eyes. They would then look either out the window at a distant\nlandmark or at a book nearby, depending on their vision problem.\nSome patients looked through glass lenses of varying strengths, and\nothers peered through tiny pinholes poked in metal lenses.\n\n   Richard Carney, a retired Kansas City priest, sought out\nKennebeck's therapy in the early 1950s. Carney's glasses were a\nnuisance during the baseball and basketball games he played while a\nstudent at Conception Seminary in northern Missouri. He had heard\nthat Kennebeck favored jettisoning spectacles.\n\n   Although two other optometrists had told Carney he needed\nglasses, he got rid of them at Kennebeck's urging _ flung them out\nthe car window as he was driving over the Missouri River, in fact,\non his way back from Kennebeck's office.\n\n   ``I didn't wear glasses for 20 years,'' he said. ``I was 41 when\nI got glasses again.''\n\n   Kennebeck convinced Carney that his sore, watery eyes were the\nresult of poor reading habits.\n\n   ``I would stare at the lines and never blink my eyes,'' Carney\nsaid. ``My eyes never relaxed, and got sore. Watering was a\nreaction to soreness. He said, `You have to blink more.' ''\n\n   Brookside resident Don McDonald Sr., a nephew of Kennebeck, has\nseen letters from former patients testifying to how much their\nsight improved with Kennebeck's unorthodox treatments.\n\n   McDonald remembers that the optometrist refused to ever wear\nglasses.\n\n   Kennebeck definitely was an outsider in his profession. He spoke\nto a group of optometrists at Columbia University about his\ntechnique early on, but he never gained a following, according to\nhis daughter. He then kept his theories to himself, recalls Louis\nBono, a retired optometrist who grew up as a neighbor of\nKennebeck's in Brookside.\n\n   Although Bono didn't embrace Kennebeck's approach, he recalls\nthat patients reported success. Men rejected by the Air Force\nbecause of vision problems often sought out Kennebeck's services.\nAnd Bono says many of them improved their vision enough to be\naccepted as pilots in World War II.\n\n   ``He could bring them perhaps from 20-30 to 20-20'' by teaching\nthem tactics to make sense of blurry images, according to Bono.\n\n   Behind Kennebeck's approach was the premise that some vision\nproblems are caused at least in part by the way people use their\neyes. Refractive disorders _ nearsightedness and farsightedness _\noccur when light rays, which are bent or refracted by the lens and\nthe cornea, meet either in front of or behind the retina, causing\nblurry vision. The distance is too long, from front to back, in the\ncase of nearsightedness (also known as myopia), and too short in\nthe case of farsightedness (hyperopia).\n\n   The role of reading and other ``near work'' in the development\nof myopia ``is a topic of great debate in the research community,''\nsaid Karla Zadnik, an associate professor at the Ohio State\nUniversity College of Optometry. ``It's an ongoing debate.''\n\n   Kennebeck believed that children should not wear glasses at\nleast until the age of 10 or so, when eye growth mostly ceases.\n\n   Studies involving different animal species have established that\neye growth during childhood is affected by environmental factors _\nspecifically, the clarity of the images eyes are exposed to. An eye\nexposed to a fuzzy image will grow in such a way as to compensate,\nto some degree, for the vision impairment, according to Michael\nOberdorfer, a grants administrator for the National Eye Institute\nin Rockville, Md.\n\n   The federal government is financing a study of 450 nearsighted\nchildren to determine whether early eye strain exacerbates myopia,\nZadnik said. The study also might show whether the strain that\nresults from ``near work'' contributes to myopia.\n\n   Half of the children are being fitted with standard single-lens\nglasses and half with progressive bifocals to minimize the strain\nof reading and other close work. In the next three years the\nresearchers will compare the two groups' myopia. The results might\nsuggest that early eye strain promotes nearsightedness, which would\nreinforce Kennebeck's belief.\n\n   ``They're talking about retarding the future development of\nmyopia,'' not regaining vision that's already been lost, Zadnik\nsaid. She characterized Kennebeck's claims as ``pretty dramatic.''\n\n   David Guyton, too, is circumspect about Kennebeck's apparent\nbelief that he could prevent or in some cases correct certain\nvisual problems. Guyton is a professor of ophthalmology and\ndirector of the Krieger Children's Eye Center at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity in Baltimore.\n\n   Many doctors who treat vision problems acknowledge that glasses,\n``especially for close work, can make your nearsightedness worse,''\nGuyton said. ``That we know pretty well. The way to keep it from\ngetting worse is not to push glasses on people.''\n\n   That leaves the problem of how people with refractive errors\nwill compensate for whatever visual problems they have, he noted.\n\n   As for Kennebeck's theory that children and young adults, at\nleast, could exercise their way to improved vision, Guyton said:\n``There are certain exercises for eyes that are misaligned that can\nmake them better. There's not much that can be done in the way of\nexercises to change refractive errors that we know of. There's been\na fringe element of people out there all this time who have claimed\nthere are ways to do this.\n\n   ``This type of treatment is looked at by most ophthalmologists\nand optometrists as a type of quackery. And yet, there are certain\nthings that these `quacks' have done that do work. You can't say\neverything is wrong. Some of the things they are doing have merit,\nand some don't. Separating them out is a bag of worms.''\n","Headline":"\nGROUP REKINDLES INTEREST IN KC OPTOMETRIST'S UNORTHODOX METHODS \n","Text":["\n   Were you a patient?\n","\n   If you were a patient of Joseph J.
