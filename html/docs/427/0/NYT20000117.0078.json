This\nchemical reaction destroys the tiny vessels and seals off the\nbleeding, without damaging the overlying retina's vision cells.\n\n   ``This is the first treatment (for wet macular degeneration)\nthat's been shown effective in large clinical trials,'' said Dr.\nJoan Miller, an eye surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear\nInfirmary, where the procedure was developed. Miller and her\ncolleague, Dr. Evangelos S. Gragoudas, suggested as far back as\n1991 that PDT, which has previously been used in treating cancer,\nmight be a novel weapon against wet macular degeneration.\n\n   AMD, in its wet form and the more common but less severe ``dry''\nform, is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 50,\naffecting an estimated 25 to 30 million people worldwide. Most of\nthe serious vision loss is caused by the wet form, which involves\nthe leaking, abnormal blood vessels. It strikes about 10 to 15\npercent of all AMD patients.\n\n   The exact cause isn't known, but risk factors, in addition to\nage, may include genetics, smoking, cataracts, excessive sun\nexposure, and a diet low in certain antioxidants.\n\n   ``Macular'' in AMD refers to the macula, the circle of\ndensely-packed light-sensing cells in the center of the retina,\nwhich are used for reading and detailed vision. When the macula is\ndamaged, a person loses central vision, often forcing him or her to\ngive up driving, making reading difficult or impossible, and\nblotting out the details of faces.\n\n   Patients often become dependent on low-vision aids _ like\nmagnifiers and reading machines _ and on human helpers. As their\nworld shrinks, they may become withdrawn and depressed.\n\n   The new treatment, PDT, is not a cure. Nor does it bring back\nvision that's been lost. But in many cases it can prevent the\ndisease from worsening _ for how long isn't yet known _ and it has\neven slightly improved sight in a small number of volunteers.\n\n   Dr. Neil Bressler, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine\nophthalmologist, said that while the treatment won't enable\npatients to resume driving, for example, it will help preserve\nvision, ``so that it's more likely you can do more things for\nyourself, like using magnification aids to read your bills, so you\ndon't have to wait for your daughter to come over and read them for\nyou.''\n\n   Massachusetts Eye and Ear's Miller and Gragoudas carried out\nanimal tests that demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT and\nestablished treatment guidelines. They then led clinical tests that\nbegan in 1995 and produced favorable results that CIBAVision, of\nDuluth, Ga., submitted to the FDA seeking approval to commercialize\nit.\n\n   One of the first patients to be treated in the clinical trial\nwas Suzanne Deuchler, 70, of Aurora, Ill. She said recently that\nPDT treatments at Mass Eye and Ear have enabled her to continue her\npolitical lobbying work in Illinois, where she is a former member\nof the state legislature.\n\n   ``I have pretty much held my own'' against the disease since\nentering the PDT clinical trial in 1996, she said in a recent\ninterview after her latest dye-and-laser treatment. Following a few\nsessions, she's actually found her vision not just stabilized but\nimproved slightly. ``I could look at the hands and numbers of my\nwatch, and they were much sharper,'' she said.\n\n   Richard Regan, a 67-year-old electronics engineer, got PDT\ntreatment in his left eye, which was virtually blinded by wet\nmacular degeneration.\n\n   After several treatments, he says, ``I have now recovered a\ngreat deal of the sense of an image. It's poorly defined; it's\nmottled and distorted as if looking through a Coke bottle bottom _\nbut it's better than it was.''\n\n   Even those most enthusiastic about PDT caution that it is not a\nmagic bullet for wet AMD. Only about 30 percent of people with the\nproblem will be good candidates, based on the location of the\nleaking vessels. In addition, because the vessels often grow back,\nmost patients in the trials have needed repeated treatments.\n\n   Nevertheless, ``I think the enthusiasm is totally justified, and\nI think it will be widely used,'' said Dr. Carmen Puliafito,\ndirector of the New England Eye Center, where about 100 macular\ndegeneration patients underwent PDT treatment as part of the\nclinical trials. ``There was nothing we could do about this in the\npast.''\n\n   PDT treatment takes only a half-hour or so, and begins with an\nintravenous injection of the light-sensitive dye into the patient's\narm. The dye makes its way through the circulation and accumulates\nin the abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina. After 15 minutes,\nthe doctor shines a low-powered laser through the pupil: when it\nhits the dye in the abnormal blood vessels, the dye releases\nsubstances that destroy them.\n\n   The patient has to wear dark glasses and stay away from sunshine\nand fluorescent lights for a few days, but otherwise there are no\napparent side effects.\n\n   Last fall, researchers published results of the latest phase of\nthe PDT clinical trials, comparing patients who received the\nlight-sensitive drug and laser treatment to those who got an\ninactive placebo drug by injection.\n\n   One year after treatment, 61 percent of those who received the\nactive drug had a small or no loss of vision, compared to 46\npercent of those on the placebo. That's significant, though not\ndramatic. But in a subgroup of patients who had what's called the\n``classic'' form of wet AMD, meaning that the errant blood vessels\nare growing under the center of the retina and their extent is\nwell-defined, the results were stronger: 67 percent of the treated\nvolunteers lost little vision, compared to 39 percent of placebo\npatients.\n\n   There's similar optimism at CIBAVision, which is marketing the\ntreatment under the name Visudyne. (A separate company, QLT\nPhotoTherapeutics of Vancouver, makes the Visudyne dye.) ``We feel\nconfident'' that the agency will act favorably, said Stephen Lang,\na marketing executive with CIBA Vision. The procedure is expected\nto cost about $1,500 per treatment.\n\n   Because most AMD patients are on Medicare, the cost of\ntreatments _ and retreatments _ presumably will fall mainly on the\nfederal government. Reimbursement policy won't be set until the\ntreatment wins FDA approval, said a spokesman for the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n   Some eye specialists want to see more data on PDT's\neffectiveness before they wholeheartedly endorse it.\n\n   ``It's not clear how much you're gaining'' in extra months or\nyears of vision, said Dr. Michael Marmor, a retina specialist at\nStanford.\n\n   ``If it turns out that 80 percent of people stabilize with\nuseful reading vision for five years, then it would be\nworthwhile,'' said Marmor, speaking on behalf of the American\nAcademy of Ophthalmology. ``But if you're only prolonging useful\nvision by three to five months, then I don't think it's\neconomically reasonable in the long run.''\n\n   Marmor, however, called the technique ``powerful'' and said\nresearch should continue in hopes of improving PDT's effectiveness.\n\n   What is not clear from the trials so far is how frequently\npatients may need retreatments to shut down maverick blood vessels\nthat regrow following PDT. In the clinical trials, most patients\nneeded retreatment, some as often as every three months. Miller at\nMass Eye and Ear says that after several treatments the blood\nvessels may be less prone to re-forming, but only longer followup\nwill determine that.\n\n   Meanwhile, other efforts to combat wet AMD continue. Some\nresearchers are working with angiogenesis inhibitors, substances\nthat curb the growth of new blood vessels. None has yet proven\nsuccessful, but research go``There's huge interest in\nangiogenesis inhibitors here,'' said senior scientist Ann Elsner at\nthe Schepens Eye Research Institute in Boston.\n\n   What has driven her to spend the past 12 years trying to find\nanswers to macular degeneration, she said, ``is that we see the\nawful outcome every day. It's just a huge public health problem.''\n","Headline":"\nNEW TECHNIQUE MAY HALT VISION-LOSS CONDITION IN ELDERLY \n","Text":["\n   Snaking beneath the thin retina at the back of the eye, tiny\nblood vessels grow where they shouldn't be growing, leaking blood\nand fluid and buckling and damaging the light-sensitive tissue in\ntens of thousands of people each year.\n","\n   As a result of this process, referred to as the ``wet'' form of\nage-related macular degeneration (AMD), the central zone of vision\nblurs and darkens, leaving a ring of less-sharp peripheral sight.\n","\n   ``Living with macular degeneration means living in a half-veiled\nworld,'' wrote Henry Grunwald, former editor in chief of Time, in a\nrecent account of his struggle to cope with this insidious disease.\n","\n   Until the last few years, there was no treatment for wet AMD,\nexcept for blasting the abnormal blood vessels with a powerful\nlaser, which inevitably damaged the retina.\n","\n   But a new procedure conceived in Boston and tested at eye\ncenters in the United States and abroad is expected to be approved\nby the US Food and Drug Administration, possibly as soon as next\nmonth.\n","\n   Called photodynamic therapy, or PDT, it attacks the rogue blood\nvessels, which doctors fill with a light-sensitive dye that is then\nactivated by a laser that is beamed through the pupil.
