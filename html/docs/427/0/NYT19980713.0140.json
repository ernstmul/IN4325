Most cosmetic products have\npreservatives to slow that process, but the bacteria eventually win\nout, and a meeting between bacteria and the surface of the eye can\nhave devastating consequences.\n\n   The danger is greatest with mascara, because it's worn the\nclosest to the eye. Fortunately, protecting yourself requires\nfollowing only a few simple precautions recommended by the American\nAcademy of Ophthalmology.\n\n   --First, if your eye makeup has been open more than three\nmonths, throw it out and replace it -- especially mascara.\n\n   --Second, never share cosmetics with anyone, because you could\nbe sharing an infection as well.\n\n   --Third, opt for hypoallergenic products and disposable\napplicators wherever possible.\n\n   --And fourth, if you do develop an eye infection, throw out all\nyour old makeup -- contaminated cosmetics could re-infect you.\n\n   Contact lens wearers need to exercise extra care when using\ncosmetics, because some products can damage eyes and lenses. Use\nonly water-based mascara -- avoid mascaras labeled\n``lash-building'' or ``guaranteed waterproof'' because they contain\nrayon or nylon fibers that can fall into the eye, slip under a\ncontact lens and injure the cornea.\n\n   The same thing can happen with frosted or iridescent eye shadows\n-- they contain ground oyster shells and tinsel. Avoid them, and\ngenerally speaking, don't buy makeup that may not have been\nthoroughly tested for safety.\n\n   Your morning makeup-and-lens routine can be critical, too. Use\nhair spray and other aerosols first, and wait for the mist to clear\nbefore inserting your contacts. Put your lenses in before applying\nyour makeup, and take them out before removing it.\n\n   Be careful with eyeliner and don't apply it inside the lower\nlashes. Apply face powder gently to keep it away from your eyes.\nAnd throughout the process, wash your hands with a pure,\nadditive-free bar soap.\n\n   One final safety tip -- don't put on your makeup in the car,\neven if you're not driving. One abrupt stop or pothole could mean a\npainful meeting between a mascara brush and your eye -- and a trip\nto the ophthalmologist.\n\n   -----\n\n   Elliot M.
