For\nevery U.S. dollar, a visitor to Canada gets about $1.48 Canadian.\n\n   Another is a complex pricing structure in the United States that\nadds to the expense with doctor referral fees, and a $260 premium\nthat doctors must pay to the laser manufacturer every time they use\nthe machine.\n\n   ``The American people are currently being ripped off,'' said\nMichael R.

Henderson's company has been marketing to U.S.\ncustomers with newspaper ads and seminars.\n\n   The company estimates that about 30 percent of the customers at\nits 11 Canadian clinics come from the United States.\n\n   Colleen Lemza of Warrensburg, N.Y., said cost was only one\nfactor when she chose to have her eyes corrected with laser surgery\nin 1995, the same year the procedure was approved in the United\nStates by the FDA.\n\n   ``At that time it was the experience factor,'' said Lemza, since\nlaser surgery had already been approved in Canada several years\nearlier.\n\n   On a recent day, Dr. Stephen Fichman, an ophthalmologist who\nruns Laser Image Center in downtown Montreal, had nine patients\nfrom the United States scheduled for surgery. He estimated that\nabout a third of his practice is Americans from Vermont, New York\nand New Hampshire.\n\n   ``We have more expertise here, we've been doing it longer,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   And surgeon experience is key, according to the American Academy\nof Ophthalmology.\n\n   Dr. Sandra Belmont, a spokeswoman for the Academy and an\nophthalmologist in New York City, has advised prospective patients\nto look not only at surgeons' credentials but at the volume of\nprocedures they perform.\n\n   As with many operations, including open heart surgery, doctors\nwho perform laser eye surgery get better with practice.\n\n   With most insurance companies no longer covering the cost of\ncataract surgery, health specialists say there is a financial\nincentive for doctors to get into the booming business of laser eye\nsurgery as a way to make ends meet.\n\n   Recent federal approval of laser eye surgery for farsightedness\nhas added millions potential patients.
