I don't know,'' said Smolik, whose\nfamily immigrated to Texas from Moravia after the Civil War. ``It's\npitiful. I don't know where to start.''\n\n   He then dropped the brim of his cowboy hat and raised his right\nthumb and forefinger to his eyes to catch the tears.\n\n   Families returned to homes wrenched from their foundations by\nfloodwaters that rose more than 10 feet in four hours and swept\nthrough Cuero like a tidal wave.\n\n   Statewide, the death toll from the devastating floods rose to 27\nThursday as the bodies of five more victims were discovered.\n\n   The Guadalupe River crested here at 49.78 feet early Monday and\nsent water surging over its banks and through portions of the city\nat 138,974 cubic feet per second.\n\n   The force of the water left homes standing in the middle of\nstreets, boats balancing precariously on the hoods of pickup trucks\nand debris hanging from fencelines.\n\n   ``We had two-thirds of our city affected, probably of that\ntwo-thirds, half of that is what I call a war zone.

He said\ndamage cost estimates had not been determined.\n\n   ``My main concern is the public safety right now, trying to do\nas much as a I can for these people; 3,000 of the 7,000 people here\nhave been affected,'' he said.\n\n   Red Cross officials fed 1,700 people displaced by the flood\nTuesday and had sheltered more than 1,000 the night before.\n\n   The flood surge cut through Cuero just before noon Tuesday,\nwithout warning.
