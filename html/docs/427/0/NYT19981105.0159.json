Instead of going\naway, it gets worse, and the itch gets ferocious. You try not to\nscratch. This is no mosquito bite on your ankle.\n\n   When it's your eyes that itch, scratching seems like a bad idea.\n\n   With weeks to go before the ragweed ends its fall riot, it's\ntime for eye drops _ one more weapon in the allergy armory.\n\n   Itchy eyes often signal an allergic reaction to contact with\nallergens such as dust, animal hair and pollen. Like a runny nose,\na wheezy cough or a ballistic sneeze, eyes made itchy by allergy\ncan be helped by taking antihistamine capsules or tablets.\n\n   But these alone may not relieve the wickedly itchy eye.\n\n   ``You may need to use eye drops for a local allergic reaction,''\nsaid Benjamin Interiano, associate professor of medicine at Baylor\nCollege of Medicine in Houston.\n\n   Make sure your drops contain antihistamine or they won't help\nthe itching caused by allergies. Some drops aren't intended for\nallergy, but to help with dry or irritated eyes. Since the itching\nmay also be caused by infection or a dry eye, make certain that\nallergy is the culprit.\n\n   Over-the-counter eye drops that contain antihistamines include\nNaphcon-A, Naphoptic-A, Naphazoline Plus, Opcon-A and Vasocon-A.\nEach of these except Opcon-A have generic equivalents, according to\nthe Methodist Hospital Drug Information Center. Your doctor may\nprescribe an alternative.\n\n   Interiano said cold weather will tame the pollens that have been\nparticularly heavy this year after a mild winter. He suggests\navoiding early morning outdoor exposure, when pollens are at their\nworst. Unless, of course, you are out so early that dew will keep\nthe pollen down. Late afternoon is the best time to be out, he\nsaid.\n\n   Three other very common conditions can also cause itchy eyes,\nsaid Baylor ophthalmologist Eric Holz.\n\n   Women are particularly susceptible to dry eye, he said. When the\neye gets dry and irritated, he said, eye drops designed to clear\nredness can actually make the condition worse because the\ndecongestant in them causes the blood vessels in the eye to\noverdilate as the drops wear off.\n\n   Instead of routine use of eye drops, the solution for dry eyes\nis artificial tears, Holz said. These are available over the\ncounter.\n\n   Blepharitis is another extremely common condition, Holz said.\nThe culprit here is a bacterial infection of the tiny oil glands in\nthe eye lids that interferes with the proper coating of the eye.\nThis is a chronic but treatable condition, he said.\n\n   Cleansing the eyelids with no-sting baby shampoo or a special\neyelid scrub will remove the grit, debris and bacteria that build\nup.\n\n   Holz said contact lens wearers must be careful about redness and\nirritation because it can indicate an allergy to the contact lens\nsolution, to the protein buildup on the lens or to the composition\nof the lens itself. This can lead to very serious eye infections.\nIf taking the contacts out for a while doesn't take care of the\nproblem, he suggests a visit to the optometrist or ophthalmologist.\n\n   Out of drops and your eyes are driving you crazy?\n\n   It's not professional advice, but Lenz said that occasional\nmoderate rubbing of the eyes probably won't damage them unless\nyou've had recent surgery.   \n   \nXXXEND OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nWHEN RAGWEED ATTACKS YOUR EYES, IT'S TIME FOR EYE DROPS \n\n","Text":["\n   First it's a little tickle and you ignore it.
