This\nsounds stupid, but I can see what I'm doing in the shower.''\n\n   The work by Dr. James Salz at Cedars-Sinai and the Freedom\nVision Laser Center, and by others around the country, led to\nFederal Drug Administration approval in November for laser surgery\nto correct farsightedness. And Salz and others are now conducting\ntrials to correct farsightedness complicated by astigmatism.\n\n   Salz is working with 35 Southern California volunteers out of\n200 cases nationwide for the astigmatism study, which he expects\nwill be done by August. The previous study, with about the same\nnumber of patients, ran from February 1997 until FDA approval in\nNovember.\n\n   In 94 percent of those cases, patients were restored to at least\n20/40 vision, he said.\n\n   Nearsightedness, or myopia, results when the eyeball is too\nlong, forcing light rays to focus in front of the retina instead of\non it. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the eyeball is too\nflat, so light rays reach the retina before they come into focus.\n\n   Astigmatism is an unequal curvature of the cornea, which can\ncause further distortion beyond near- or farsightedness.\n\n   The FDA had long ago approved use of the laser to correct\nnearsightedness, which affects about 60 million Americans.\n\n   And with the federal approval, the 30 million farsighted people\nin the country now have a chance to see without glasses that fog up\nin the heat or get splattered in the rain, or contact lenses that\ndry up in air conditioning or float away during a swim.\n\n   ``And what if there's an earthquake and you can't get to your\nglasses, or a fire?'' Redline said.\n\n   Calliopi Ash of Encino constantly felt uncomfortable wearing\nglasses or contacts. After her surgery in September, she said her\nvision improved about 80 percent.\n\n   ``I can't see like I used to see when I was a young girl, but I\ncan see without the glasses,'' Ash said.\n\n   And suburban West Hills ophthalmologist Samuel Masket, who has\nbegun using the laser to treat farsightedness, said those people\n``are among the happiest patients I've ever seen.'' His wife,\nBarbara, will soon have the surgery herself.\n\n   Nearsighted people can at least see at close range, Masket said,\nbut a farsighted person ``past a certain age doesn't have good\nvision at any range.''\n\n   Masket said about 5 percent of laser-surgery cases have\ncomplications, which can include improper cuts or infections that\ncan result in a corneal ulcer. Permanent damage is extremely rare,\nand the result of most complications is vision correction that\nisn't quite as good as it should have been.\n\n   Salz's laser research opened the door for two types of surgery\n-- PRK and LASIK, both of which were already being used for\nnearsightedness. Once the FDA approved the use of the laser to\ncorrect farsightedness, ophthalmologists were free to perform\neither type of work.\n\n   With PRK, or photorefractive keratectomy, the surgeon cuts away\nat the surface of the cornea. With LASIK, or laser in-situ\nkeratomileusis, the doctor shaves a flap from the surface of the\ncornea, then uses the laser to sculpt the less-sensitive inner\ncells of the cornea. So LASIK involves a slightly greater risk, but\nresults in a shorter recovery period and less chance of pain, Salz\nsaid.\n\n   ``The results are actually pretty similar,'' he said. ``People\nobviously want the easy way out if they can get it.''\n\n   Myopia is easier to fix, because it involves shaving some tissue\noff the center of the cornea, making it flatter. Fixing\nfarsightedness is a little tricker, as the surgeon must use the\nlaser to trim around the center of the cornea to make it steeper.\n\n   Medicare, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross don't cover the laser\nprocedures, which can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 per eye, the\ndoctors said.\n\n   But Redline and the other patients compared the cost to\ncontinual replacement of eyeglasses or contact lenses.\n\n   ``It's expensive, but then so too are a lot of things,'' Redline\nsaid. ``It wasn't too much or I wouldn't have done it.''\n\n   With the right tools and the proper training, the surgery isn't\nvery difficult, Salz said. But visions of someone cutting into the\neyeball like a butcher slicing luncheon meat, or incinerating part\nof the cornea with a laser, can be a little intimidating.\n\n   ``You have to be a little brave,'' Ash said.\n\n   The patient is awake during the entire procedure, which takes\nonly a few minutes. The only anesthesia is eye-numbing drops.\n\n   ``I was scared, which I think is natural, because it's your\neyesight,'' said Redline. ``If you lose it, you don't get it\nback.''\n\n   But after the operation, ``they sit you up and you see.

It's just amazing.''\n\n   XXX\n","Headline":"\nFARSIGHTEDNESS CAN BE A DISTANT MEMORY WITH NEW LASER TECHNIQUE\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES -- As revolutionary as a laser procedure that vastly\nimproves nearsightedness, a newly approved technique now is\navailable to just about reverse farsightedness.\n","\n   The breakthrough surgery was perfected by a doctor during\nclinical trials at his suburban Encino eye clinic and at\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n","\n   After years of waking up to a blurry world, Kathy Redline wept\nwhen she saw her face clearly in the mirror for the first time in\ndecades.\n","\n   ``I was putting makeup on and the whole time I was crying\nbecause I could see what I was doing,'' said Redline, 54, a\nsuburban Newbury Park resident. ``And I can shave my legs.
