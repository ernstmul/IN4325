The goal\nis to see if light prevents arteries from re-clogging after a\nspecial type of heart surgery, said Francis P. Gasparro, who helped\norganize this week's 13th International Congress on Photobiology.\n\n   In recent years, a popular kind of heart surgery has involved\nthe insertion of a long catheter, which carries a small balloon,\ninto an artery feeding into the heart. The catheter is routed\ntoward the artery through a wide vein in the leg.\n\n   Once the catheter reaches the desired artery, surgeons inflate\nthe balloon. The balloon flattens out accumulated plaque that is\nblocking blood flow. Ideally this method (known as trasluminal\nballoon angioplasty) allows the resumption of normal, unblocked\nblood flood into the heart.\n\n   However, in a small percentage of cases, the artery clogs again\nwithin months.\n\n   What might be done to prevent such re-clogging of the artery? A\nsolution, now being tested on lab animals, involves sliding a\nfiber-optic tube through the catheter into the heart. The\nfiber-optic line can transmit an intense beam of light to the site\nof the clogging.\n\n   Scientists suspect that by illuminating the arterial interior\nfor several minutes, they might be able to hasten the healing of\nscar tissue that would otherwise seed future clogging.\n\n   Past research indicates that light accelerates wound healing in\nsurface skin, perhaps by stimulating the skin's immune system. It\nis therefore worth seeing if the same thing will happen inside\narteries, Gasparro said.\n\n   Lab tests of the procedure on rabbits and pigs have been ``very\nencouraging,'' said Gasparro, a professor of physical chemistry at\nThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is not directly\nconnected with the research.\n\n   However, ``it's too early to say whether this approach is\nefficacious. No one has yet done a clinical study in humans,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Human tests could begin within a year at the Mayo Clinic in\nRochester, Minn., and elsewhere.\n\n   The science of photobiology began to attract public attention in\nthe 1970s, when scientists began fearing a future epidemic of skin\ncancer caused by increasing solar ultraviolet (UV) light.\n\n   UV levels would rise, they forecast, because pollutants called\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were slowly destroying the atmospheric\nozone layer. The ozone layer normally provides a shield from\ncancer-causing solar radiation.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   Scientists at the meeting also said they still have not found\nconvincing scientific evidence that suntan lotions protect against\na wide variety of skin cancers.\n\n   There is ``limited evidence'' that suntan lotion protects\nagainst one type of cancer and another, pre-cancerous condition,\nGaparro said. However, he warned, there is no clear evidence that\nthe lotion protects against many types of skin cancer.\n\n   Gasparro based his comments on a report at Tuesday's sessions by\nA.R. Young of St. John's Institute of Dermatology in London.\n\n   Young reported ``limited evidence'' that suntan lotion may\nprotect against a type of skin cancer called squamous cell\ncarcinoma and a pre-cancerous condition known as actinic keratosis.\n\n   Yet science still has not established the ability of suntan\nlotion to protect against skin cancer in general, Young cautioned\nin an abstract of his talk.\n","Headline":"\n      LIGHT MAY HELP KEEP ARTERIES UNCLOGGED \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists say light could help prevent a small\npercentage of heart attacks if doctors shine it into the interior\nof human arteries.\n","\n   Sometime within the next year, researchers at the Mayo Clinic\nand elsewhere may begin beaming light into human arteries.
