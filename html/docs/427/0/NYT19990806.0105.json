Police are\nwarning that gridlock is nearly inevitable and advise travelers to\nstay away from the roads during peak times and to carry bicycles to\nget around. The last total eclipse in Britain, in 1927, attracted\nmore than 3 million people to Yorkshire in Northern England. At\nleast 1 million are expected in Cornwall.\n\n   In addition to the hassle of so many people, some local\nofficials are fearful about the historic sites. Mike Rosendale, an\nofficial with the Penwith district council, is worried about the\ninflux of alternative groups\n\n   that place special significance to the eclipse and its passage\nthrough what is seen as a mystically rich land.\n\n   ``This area has the highest concentration of prehistoric\nmonuments in Western Europe and the eclipse and the Millennium are\ndisaster for them,'' Rosendale said. ``They have never been under\nso much pressure, never faced this level of threat for 4,000\nyears.''\n\n   Consequently, about 30,000 acres near Penzance have been sealed\noff to protect monuments. Additional police and military forces\nwill be on alert during the week.\n\n   Andrew Norfolk, a member of an organization called the Pagan\nFederation, believes these concerns are exaggerated. Norfolk has\nbeen on the speaking circuit for months warning fellow pagans to\nbehave themselves. ``It is the most important event for pagans this\ndecade,'' he said. ``The Millennium has no significance for us, but\nan eclipse sees the major symbols of paganism coming together,\nwhere masculine and feminine forces are balanced and it is a time\nfor great chance.''\n\n   ``We want people to avoid lighting fires, burying things or\ndoing things with candles,'' Norfolk said.\n\n   Bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and even spare rooms are largely\nbooked up.
