Slight problem in the left eye. Time for\nan appointment.\n\n   She remembered an ad for a free eye exam at an eye surgical\ncenter and made an appointment for Oct. 29. After dilation and an\nhour of charts and lights, the doctor offered this somber finding:\nCataracts in both eyes, beginning of glaucoma in both eyes, and a\n``wet'' retina, indicative of bleeding.\n\n   Stunned, Nellie asked: ``What can I do?''\n\n   The glaucoma, of course, was treatable, and cataract removal is\nan outpatient procedure. The doctor's upbeat observation was that\nfor $2,500 an eye, Nellie could get corrective laser surgery, which\nwould, at the same time, take care of the cataracts.\n\n   ``You won't have to wear glasses anymore,'' he said.\n\n   First, of course, he added, she would want to get a specialist\nto look at that retina.\n\n   Our HMO pushed buttons and got her an appointment with an\nophthalmologist in three days. The new doctor was most reassuring.\nHe had trained at Yale, worked between two offices and had his own\nsurgical eye center. Like the earlier examination, the procedure\nwas very thorough. Different results, though.\n\n   ``That first doctor was way off base,'' the HMO's doctor said,\nevidently perplexed. He found no cataracts. As for glaucoma, the\nreadings were only ``suspect.'' And, he told Nellie, she did not\nhave a wet retina.\n\n   ``You have a macular hole in your left eye.''\n\n   That didn't sound good. And it wasn't. The macula is the lining\nof the retina that contains the photoreceptive cells necessary for\nvision. ``You will slowly lose sight in that eye,'' the doctor\ninformed her.\n\n   How could this happen? Bad luck, the doctor said. What about\ndrops, surgery, anything? How could she teach tennis?\n\n   Even as the doctor shook his head, he saw that she was\npanicking. ``You can still play your tennis,'' he assured her.\n``Babe Ruth played baseball with one eye.''\n\n   Nellie broke down. She didn't want to believe that there wasn't\nat least some particle of hope of saving her vision. ``I'm going to\nget another opinion!'' she blurted out.\n\n   ``Get as many opinions as you want,'' he replied. ``But that's\nthe story.''\n\n   It was raining as Nellie sat in her car and cried.\n\n   Then she did seek another opinion, an opinion she paid for\nherself because she wrongfully concluded that the HMO had taken her\nas far as it would go. The next day she went to an optometrist,\ndesperate to hear someone, anyone tell her that she would not lose\nvision in her left eye.\n\n   The optometrist asked if she had seen a retina specialist. No,\nshe replied, she had seen the ophthalmologist on the HMO list, and\nhe had told her that it was pointless to go farther.\n\n   ``If it were my eye,'' the optician said, ``I would see a\nspecialist and get his opinion.''\n\n   Now Nellie went back to her primary care physician and insisted\nthat the HMO send her to a retina specialist. Dutifully, the HMO\nobliged, getting her an appointment in three weeks. Nellie saw the\nretina specialist, and this time the exam was exhaustive. She was\ninjected with dyes and dozens of pictures were taken inside her\neye. With his results spread before him, the doctor said:\n\n   ``You do not have a macular hole.''\n\n   ``Swear it,'' Nellie said, fervently.\n\n   ``I swear,'' the doctor said. ``You do not have macular\ndegeneration,'' he pointed out. ``You do not have cataracts. Years\ndown the road you might have glaucoma. What you do have is a\nmembrane that's grown over the macula, a puckered film that\ndistorts your vision.''\n\n   He showed her the pictures. She saw the wrinkled membrane that\nexplained the wavy lines on the tennis court.\n\n   ``And something can be done?'' my wife wondered hopefully.\n\n   ``Well, how bad is this problem?'' the doctor asked. ``Can you\nlive with it? There is a surgery that can remove the membrane, but\nin 60 percent of the cases, a cataract forms within the year which,\nof course, must be removed.''\n\n   Since the specialist assured her that the condition will not get\nworse or affect her reading or driving, Nellie has decided that she\ncan put up with the occasional wavy line on the tennis court\n\n   My wife is grateful. Grateful for the optician who said if it\nwere his eye, he would consult a specialist. Grateful for our HMO,\nwhich moved on her request even though its own ophthalmologist said\nit would be pointless. Grateful for a doctor who correctly\ndiagnosed her condition. Grateful enough to want their names known\n_ optometrist Dr. O.K. Haugen for the referral, Health Options for\nhonoring her wishes, and retina specialist Dr. Randy Katz for going\nthe extra mile.\n\n   I see no reason to name others who offered what I am sure were\ndefensible opinions, given their limitations. I'll leave the final\nwords to Nellie. ``When it's your health or your life at stake,\ninsist on a second or third or even fourth opinion. Remember that\ndoctors aren't Gods, they're fallible human beings.''\n\n   Ron Wiggins writes for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach,\nFla.
