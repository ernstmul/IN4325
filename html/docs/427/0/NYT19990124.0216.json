And today, Sun's\ntechnology wizard will reveal what he hopes will be the next wave\nof magic for the computer industry.\n\n          Joy, along with McNealy, will preside over the official\nintroduction of Jini, a technology designed to let consumer devices\nconnect easily to networks. With it, a person on the way home from\nwork theoretically could turn on the lights and the TV, turn up the\nheat and start to defrost the chicken, all by sending simple\ninstructions over a pager, cell phone or handheld computer.\n\n   Initially, the technology will work its way into\nmore-businesslike applications, such as letting the user of a\nnotebook PC connect to a network in an airport business lounge and\nimmediately have the use of a scanner or printer.\n\n   Allowing different kinds of devices to communicate with one\nanother is seen as the next big goal for the computer industry.\nIt's a mammoth challenge, given the wide disparity in chips and\nsoftware that run computers ranging from handheld digital\nassistants to mainframes, as well as a panoply of peripheral\ndevices such as printers and modems.\n\n   Sun of Mountain View isn't the only company on the connectivity\ntrail. Microsoft is hot on Sun's heels with Universal Plug and\nPlay. Also in the game are Lucent Technologies, the big\ntelecommunications supplier, and a consortium that includes\nelectronics giants Philips and Sony.\n\n   But Sun seems to have a head start, thanks largely to Joy, who\nhas spent the past four years conjuring up Jini at the Sun Aspen\nSmallworks research and development lab in Aspen, Colo.\n\n   Joy, 44, is one of four men who co-founded Sun in 1982. But\nunlike McNealy, who became the company's high-profile leader, Joy\npreferred the ivory tower atmosphere that he had enjoyed while\ntinkering with Unix at the University of California at Berkeley.\n(The software he developed there as a grad student became Sun's\nSolaris operating system, which runs the company's powerful\nworkstations and network servers.)\n\n         The corporate life was not for Joy. ``For me, it's enjoyable\nbeing part of the creative process in the beginning,'' he said.\n``And it's also fun to be in a situation in which only a small\nnumber of people are involved.''\n\n   Joy has spent most of this decade in Aspen, where he was\ninstrumental in the development of Java, the Internet programming\nlanguage that has made Sun a major Internet player.\n\n         Java lets developers write programs that can be run on\ncomputers regardless of their operating systems. It has been key to\nbringing animation and interactivity to the World Wide Web.\n\n         Jini is an extension of Java and works with it to enable\nnetworks to open themselves up to small devices. Here's how Jini\nworks: When you connect a Jini-enabled device to a Java-enabled\nnetwork, the device announces itself to the network, which places\nthe capabilities of the device on a sort of electronic bulletin\nboard shared by other devices on the network.\n\n   If the device is something like a smart phone, it gets access to\nother resources on the network. If the device is something like a\nprinter, it becomes available to other users on the network.\n\n   In December, with Jini nearly complete, Joy emerged from his\nwizard's tower to be point man for the new technology. He was named\nchief scientist, a largely ceremonial post that he said reflected\n``Scott's desire for me to take a more mainstream role in the\ncompany.''\n\n   His job now is to explain Jini to the media and persuade other\ncompanies to build it into their devices.\n\n   ``Keep in mind that for this to work, Sun needs to have a\ntremendous number of partnerships,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin of\nSan Jose's Creative Strategies.\n\n   Sun will introduce a number of agreements with companies who are\nhopping on the bandwagon. Already, Cisco Systems has developed a\ncable modem for Jini networks, and Quantum plans a Jini-enabled\nhard disk. Other companies reportedly interested in Jini include:\nIBM, Xerox, Sony and Philips.\n\n   The first Jini products are expected to ship sometime this year,\nmost likely before Microsoft _ which hasn't set a date yet _ debuts\nits universal connection system. Nevertheless, analysts say Sun\nwill quickly face competition from Microsoft, Lucent and others.\n\n          ``You've got all these different efforts, so there's going\nto be another one of these battles over standards and protocols,''\nsaid Fran Firth, senior analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group in\nNewton, Mass.\n\n   Both Microsoft and Sun bring key advantages to the fray. Because\nmost of the world uses Windows, Microsoft already has the network\nend of the equation wrapped up. All it needs is to persuade\ncompanies to put its software in the devices that connect to the\nnetwork.\n\n   Sun has a similar edge in that Java has become nearly as\npervasive as Windows. Even Microsoft uses it. Sun also may hold an\nadvantage over Microsoft because Jini software code is very small\nand can easily fit into a handheld device. Microsoft could have\ndifficulty creating a similarly small solution based on Windows CE,\nits operating system for small devices.\n\n   Another question is whether Jini can generate significant\nrevenue for Sun _ something Java has not done because Sun doesn't\ncharge royalties for licensing it.\n\n         As with Java, Jini technology will be available for free to\ndevelopers, with the hope that it will find its way into lots of\ndevices. Sun will require, however, that Jini versions made by\nother companies be compliant with a standard set by Sun, thus\nensuring that any Jini device can work with any other one.\n\n   Sun has made the same compatibility demand for Java, and even\nsued Microsoft when it decided to develop an altered version of the\nsoftware that Sun claimed worked best on Windows.\n\n   Revenues from Jini could come primarily from trademark fees that\ncompanies will have to pay on products carrying the Jini logo.\n\n   That in itself probably won't result in much revenue.
