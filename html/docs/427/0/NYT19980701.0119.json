That organization has a special site at\nhttp://www.weather.com\n\n   /safeside/heat/ devoted to dealing with the heat.\n\n   You'll learn right away that staying cool in the extreme heat is\nmore than just a way of being comfortable. It can save your life.\nYou are reminded, high up on the page, that: ``In 1995, extreme\nheat contributed to the deaths of almost 500 people in Chicago. And\nthat same year, it killed more people in the United States than all\nother natural disasters combined.''\n\n   So pay attention as you follow the well-thought-out links on\nthis page. At the click of your mouse, you can be whisked to areas\nthat tell you what you can do to stay cool (and safe) during a heat\nwave; how to determine if your age or physical condition put you at\nspecial risk; and how to prepare for a heat emergency.\n\n   While sunburns aren't as serious as a heatstroke, they are very\ncommon in the South. And since long exposure to the sun can\nincrease your risk of skin cancer, it's worth your time to learn\nabout protecting your skin from serious burns. So before we leave\nthe excellent Weather Channel site, let's drop in at http://www\n\n   .weather.com/health/sunpro\n\n   .html.\n\n   You'll find out about sunscreens and lotions, but _ for those\nwho want to be really scientific about fighting the sun _ you can\nalso follow a link from this page to learn how to read the Weather\nChannel's ultraviolet forecast maps that show the intensity of\nthese rays in different parts of the country. The UV ratings _\nwhich start at zero and go to levels beyond 10 _ can call for\nprotection as simple as wearing a hat (at levels of 2 or below) to\nstaying inside if you can (when levels are 10 or higher).\n\n   Our next site also originates in Atlanta. It's from the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention. The page, called ``Extreme Heat\n_ A Prevention Guide to Promote Your Personal Health and Safety''\ncan be found at http://www.cdc\n\n   .gov/nceh/programs/emergenc\n\n   /prevent/heat/heat.htm. While the information isn't as\nwell-organized as what's offered by the Weather Channel, you will\nfind links from this page to topic areas that offer the same sort\nof common-sense advice you got from your mother. For instance, you\nare told to drink plenty of fluids, pace yourself when working in\nthe heat and to wear appropriate clothing. While most people who\nhave enough sense to come in from the heat already know these\nthings, you'll find plenty of details and tips that may come as a\nsurprise. For instance, it's smart _ on a really hot day _ to avoid\nextremely cold beverages since the contrast in the temperatures can\nactually produce a harmful shock to your system in some instances.\n\n   In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency site, the last\nheat-related page on our tour of hot sites says that even a cool\nshower after coming inside from hot temperatures can ``result in\nhypothermia, particularly for elderly and very young people.''\n\n   So even common sense can fail you in hot weather. But, as long\nas you're inside in air-conditioned comfort surfing the Web, you're\nsafe from even the hottest day.\n\n   Bill Husted writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n\n     \nNYT-06-29-98 1047EDT  \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Just about the coolest thing a person can do on the\nInternet at this time of the year is to find ways to get out of the\nheat.\n","\n   There are plenty of Web sites that suggest ways to stay cool\nduring the hot summer.\n","\n   Our first stop is at the Atlanta-based Weather Channel site at\nhttp://www.weather.com.
