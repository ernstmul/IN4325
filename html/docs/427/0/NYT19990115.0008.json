Times News Service clients)  \n By BOB YOUNG  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   With the start of training camp looming early next week, the\nSuns and many of the NBA's other 28 teams can do nothing but wait\npatiently while Phoenix free agent star Antonio McDyess makes up\nhis mind.\n\n   It appears that McDyess will decide between the Suns and his old\nclub, the Denver Nuggets. The Nuggets might have the edge, even\nthough the Suns can pay more.\n\n   The Houston Rockets still are interested but apparently are\nzeroing in on Chicago Bulls free agent Scottie Pippen. Orlando\napparently has tried to enter the McDyess sweepstakes, and Chicago\nBulls General Manager Jerry Krause is making a strong drive for\nhim.\n\n   McDyess, Pippen and Minnesota free agent Tom Gugliotta are the\nmost attractive players on the market, and until their decisions\nare made, very little else can fall into place.\n\n   The Suns have not given McDyess any kind of deadline, said one\nof McDyess' agents, James Bryant.\n\n   ``I think everyone wants to know what's going on as soon as\npossible,'' Bryant said. ``But there haven't been any demands. We\ndon't know when Antonio is going to make a decision. We feel like\nit's all starting to crystallize. I'd expect one pretty soon.''\n\n   The NBA deal is expected to be finalized Monday or Tuesday,\nwhich will bring a wave of free agent signings.\n\n   The Suns would like an answer as quickly as possible, Bryant\nsaid, to determine where they go next if McDyess leaves. And those\noptions may be drying up.\n\n   League sources said Thursday that Gugliotta has come to terms\nwith the Timberwolves. Minnesota still could sign him and make a\ntrade, but either way, the Suns apparently are out of the picture.\n\n   So where do they go if Gugliotta is off the board and McDyess is\nholding a news conference in Denver?\n\n   Because of the new collective bargaining rules, few options\nremain. League sources said that Chicago center Luc Longley is\nready to make a deal with Phoenix.\n\n   The Suns probably would make an offer to their own free agent\nforward, Clifford Robinson, who has had an offer from the Detroit\nPistons.\n\n   Then the Suns still could go after another, less expensive free\nagent such as Miami's Brent Barry, whom the club wanted to draft in\n1995.\n\n   Sign-and-trade scenarios are possible, but most teams probably\nwould want the Suns' first-round draft pick obtained from Dallas\nlast summer in the trade that sent Steve Nash to the Mavericks. The\nSuns might be better off holding on to that chip.\n\n   The Suns gambled in October 1997 when they traded guard Wesley\nPerson, forward Tony Dumas and four draft picks _ two first- and\ntwo second-round selections _ in a three-team deal with Cleveland\nand Denver, to get the 6-foot-10, 220-pound McDyess.\n\n   The risk was that the club might not be able to re-sign McDyess\nwhen he became a free agent at the end of the season.\n\n   Why would McDyess consider the Nuggets, a team that won 11 games\nlast season?\n\n   First, the Nuggets fired General Manager Allan Bristow, who\ntraded McDyess and said he wasn't worth a $100 million contract.\nMcDyess said last season that he would not consider playing in\nDenver again if Bristow were there. He was replaced by Dan Issel,\nwhom McDyess likes.\n\n   Second, the Nuggets traded for Nick Van Exel. McDyess and Van\nExel have become friends, and there is speculation that he will\nagree to go to Denver if the Nuggets give Van Exel a new deal next\nsummer when his contract is up. By the way, they have the same\nagents.\n\n   Third, McDyess is a small-town guy who still feels connected\nwith some of his friends in Denver and would feel comfortable with\nVan Exel around. His two closest friends with the Suns were Nash,\nwho was traded, and John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, who won't be\nre-signed.\n\n   Finally, it's possible McDyess never wanted to leave the Nuggets\nin the first place. He fired his last agent, Arn Tellem, and hired\nBryant and Tony Dutt, reportedly because Tellem forced a trade from\nDenver by demanding a $100 million contract from the Nuggets.\nTellem apparently didn't tell McDyess what the Nuggets had on the\ntable.\n\n   Bryant said McDyess likes the Phoenix organization, Coach Danny\nAinge and his teammates with the Suns, who apparently have been\nletting him know they want him back.\n\n   ``It's just a different situation with these new rules,'' Bryant\nsaid. ``It's almost like choosing a college now. The money is about\nthe same wherever he goes. You have to consider a lot more factors,\nlike the style of play, the makeup of the team, how you fit into\nthe plan, how competitive the team has a chance to be. There is a\nlot to consider.''\n\n   McDyess could not be reached for comment. A friend who is\nscreening calls made to McDyess' home and cellular numbers said\nMcDyess will not speak with reporters until he has made his\ndecision.\n\n   If the Suns renounce the rights to McDyess, they will be about\n$10.7 million below the salary cap if they keep their five contract\nplayers and do not renounce Robinson, Rex Chapman and Marko Milic.\n\n   Robinson reportedly has been offered a contract by the Detroit\nPistons, but if McDyess leaves, the Suns likely would offer him\nsome of their available cap space to keep him in Phoenix.\n\n   Still, McDyess would be a huge loss.\n\n   McDyess was arguably the Suns' best player over the last month\nof the 1997-98 season and during a first-round playoff loss to the\nSan Antonio Spurs.\n\n   During April, in which the Suns were 8-1, he averaged 19.3\npoints, 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 blocked shots and 1.89 steals, and shot\n62.2 percent.\n\n   For the season, he averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds and\njoined Alvan Adams and Garfield Heard as the only Suns to have at\nleast 100 blocked shots and 100 steals in a season.
