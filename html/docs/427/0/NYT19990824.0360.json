Times News Service    \n\n   MINNEAPOLIS _ Most cities root unabashedly for their big\nhometown companies. But here _ where Northwest Airlines has its\nheadquarters, employs 21,000 and controls 80 percent of the airline\nseats out of the city _ many people are rooting for Sun Country\nAirlines, a small local charter airline that started flying a\nregular schedule to a mere 15 destinations in June.\n\n   ``Northwest is doing anything it can to put Sun Country out of\nbusiness,'' said the Rev. Brian Kimbler, a pastor in Brainerd,\nMinn. He recently flew with Sun Country to New York with his wife\nand a group of eight teenagers from his church, paying $228 apiece,\nbelow Northwest's advanced-purchase fare of $308 and a world away\nfrom its $1,200 midweek round-trip fare. ``I like competition,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Mike Hatch, Minnesota's attorney general, also likes\ncompetition. In January, after Sun Country said it would begin\nscheduled service, he sent a letter to John H. Dasburg, Northwest's\nchief executive, putting him on notice that the attorney general's\noffice would be watching the airline's reaction to Sun Country. For\nlocal news organizations, the David-versus-Goliath battle between\nthe two airlines has been one of the biggest stories of the year.\n\n   The Department of Transportation in Washington, after being\nalerted by a letter from Hatch in April, told Northwest, the\nnation's fourth-largest airline, to report each competitive action\nit takes in relation to Sun Country.\n\n   Northwest says that such scrutiny is unwarranted. ``The impetus\nhere is not to penalize or punish Sun Country,'' said Douglas M.\nSteenland, executive vice president and general counsel at\nNorthwest.\n\n   Even with all the support Sun Country is receiving, its\nexperience shows how difficult it is for a small airline to make it\nin head-to-head competition with one of the industry's giants at\nits so-called fortress hub.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS)\n\n   Scores of new airlines have been started since the industry was\nderegulated in 1978, but only one _ America West Airlines, a unit\nof the America West Holdings Corp. of Tempe, Ariz. _ has managed to\nenter the ranks of the majors. The rest have struggled to stay\nalive or have folded, either as a result of mismanagement, ruthless\ncompetition from the major airlines or a combination of the two.\n\n   Over the same two decades the industry has consolidated into a\ncadre of giant competitors, each of which dominates one or more of\nthe nation's major airports, where they are able to charge premium\nprices.\n\n   Fifteen years ago, Northwest and Republic Airlines each carried\nroughly 40 percent of the passengers in the Twin Cities. But in\n1986, Northwest bought Republic, giving the airline a dominant\nposition overnight.\n\n   A recent study by the General Accounting Office found that fares\nin Minneapolis were, on average, 49 percent higher than those at\ncomparable airports where there is competition.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIMS)\n\n   Northwest now controls 54 of the 70 gates at the main terminal\nof Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, forcing Sun Country\nto use the Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal, a converted hangar on the\nopposite side of the tarmac. That and Sun Country's comparatively\nlimited schedule make it difficult for the airline to attract the\nlucrative business travelers.\n\n   Sun Country executives say that Northwest has matched its low\nfares on routes where the two compete and has even added flights on\nsome competing routes. They also say that Northwest has threatened\nto retaliate against travel agents who book flights on the airline\nand has even stopped sharing spare parts with the airline, a\ncourtesy commonly extended between airlines.\n\n   Northwest denied pressuring travel agents and said that it had\nmatched Sun Country's low prices selectively, leaving in place many\nof its higher walk-up fares. It said it had stopped sharing parts\nwith Sun Country, but only because Sun was asking for so many.\n\n   Steenland added that Sun Country likes to present itself as a\nstruggling upstart but is really a potent competitor because its\nowners, the La Macchia family, also own the Mark Travel Corp. of\nMilwaukee, one of the biggest package-tour companies in the\ncountry, with more than $1 billion in annual sales. (Northwest's\nrevenues last year were $9 billion.)\n\n   ``When it comes to competing primarily in the leisure markets of\nLas Vegas and Orlando, they are the Goliath and we're the David,''\nhe said.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS)\n\n   Despite what it sees as Northwest's unfair tactics, Sun Country\nis not giving up. In June, the airline announced that it would\nlease six new long-range Boeing 737's to replace some of its aging\n727's and to expand its fleet. Last week, Sun Country announced\nthat, beginning this fall, it would add a second daily flight to\nDetroit and Milwaukee and expand its service from Minneapolis with\nnew flights to San Diego, Harlingen, Texas, and three Florida\ncities.\n\n   ``We're the gum stuck to the bottom of their shoe,'' said Bill\nLa Macchia Jr., 33, Sun Country's president. Then he paused and\nadded, ``And they just can't get us off.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIMS)\n\n   Resentment against Northwest _ long referred to unaffectionately\nhere as ``Northworst'' _ has been simmering for years. It grew\nafter two outside investors, Alfred A. Checchi and Gary L. Wilson,\ntook it over in the early 1990s, loading the airline with debt in\nthe process. But the situation boiled over last fall when Northwest\npilots went on strike, shutting the airline down for 15 days and\nstranding thousands of travelers all over the Midwest.\n\n   After the strike, calls went out from politicians and community\ngroups to find some way to relax Northwest's stranglehold on the\ncity. Sun Country and La Macchia stepped forward.\n\n   Sun Country, which is based in nearby Mendota Heights, started\nas a charter airline in 1983, carrying gamblers to Las Vegas, Nev.,\nand shoppers from around the country to Minneapolis' giant Mall of\nAmerica. The La Macchias decided to buy 75 percent of the airline\nin 1997 to guarantee that flights would be available for their\npackage-tour company.\n\n   But almost immediately, the purchase seemed to be a disaster.\nSun Country lost $11 million in 1997. Rather than let the airline\ndie, the La Macchias invested an additional $5.5 million to buy the\n25 percent they did not own. ( La Macchia, whose father founded and\nstill runs Mark Travel, would not say how much the family paid for\nits initial stake.)\n\n   Sun Country was profitable in the first eight months of last\nyear. But it went into the red in the last four months, when the\ncharter market traditionally declines. One of Sun Country's biggest\ncustomers had been Northwest's package-tour company. But in recent\nyears, La Macchia said, especially after Sun Country quietly\nstarted offering some scheduled flights in 1996, Northwest began\nsteering more business to its own charter airline.\n\n   The Northwest strike convinced La Macchia that he could balance\nSun Country's wobbly revenues by expanding scheduled service and\npromoting it heavily. ``Northwest, with its lock on this market,\nreally presented the company with an opportunity,'' said Paul\nMiller, a Northwest veteran who is now Sun country's vice president\nfor market planning.\n\n   Earlier this year, Sun Country began a newspaper advertising\ncampaign claiming credit for bringing low fares to Minneapolis and\noffering the chance to win free flights for a year. The airline\nreceived more than 80,000 responses, including many handwritten\nnotes of support.\n\n   ``Bill, it would be great to fly out of Minneapolis and be\ntreated like a paying customer, not a\ntake-it-or-leave-our-service-stinks attitude like Northwest!,'' one\ncorrespondent wrote. ``And I am a gold member at Northwest.''\n\n   La Macchia, who spent 10 years working for Mirage Resorts, Inc.\nin Las Vegas, has followed in the footsteps of his old boss, the\ncasino magnate Stephen A. Wynn, by starring in his company's ads.\n\n   A first set of arch television spots shows La Macchia going door\nto door in a white shirt and tie, introducing himself to mystified\nTwin Cities residents. ``All we want to do is make air fares\nreasonable,'' La Macchia tells one indifferent housewife. ``Our\nwalk-up fares are very reasonable,'' he explains to two young boys,\nas the three sit on a curb licking popsicles.\n\n   La Macchia's strategy is to offer superior service at a lower\nprice. Customers are not penalized for buying one-way tickets and\nare not required to stay over a Saturday night to get a low fare, a\nfeature designed to appeal to business and other travelers who are\nforced to pay exorbitant fares for last-minute travel during the\nweek on large airlines.\n\n   If a recent flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport\nto Minneapolis is any guide, the strategy may soon pay dividends.\n``It's clean, it's nice, and it gets me there,'' said Don Eatz,\npresident of Monterey Fashions of Manhattan, one of the few\nbusiness travelers on board. He was skeptical at first but agreed\nto fly Sun Country when he compared the $318 fare with a $1,200\nfare on Northwest.\n\n   Several Sun Country employees also appeared to be happy with the\nnew management. Cathy Steffens, a flight attendant, joined Sun\nCountry in 1989 after 20 years at Northwest. She said she was very\nimpressed with the changes at the airline under the La Macchias and\nthat morale was much higher at Sun Country than at Northwest.\n\n   ``I think the girls are grumpy and growly,'' she said of her\nformer Northwest colleagues.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Sun Country is also working hard to make the disadvantage of\nbeing at the old Humphrey terminal into a plus. Though it is far\nfrom the main terminal and has no rental car facilities, its small\nsize makes it easy to navigate.\n\n   After coming under intense public pressure, the Minneapolis-St.\nPaul Metropolitan Airports Commission, the public agency that\noperates the Twin Cities airport and has long been seen as an\nextension of Northwest, agreed this year to spend $73 million to\nbuild a new Humphrey terminal that will be occupied primarily by\nSun Country in 2001. In the meantime, the commission earmarked\n$450,000 to spruce up the existing terminal.\n\n   In June, Sun Country's first month flying its new schedule, the\nairline managed to fill 64.3 percent of the seats on its 15 jets,\nwhile Northwest filled 80 percent of the seats on its fleet of 419\nairplanes. James R. Olsen, one of Sun Country's founders and now\nvice president for strategic planning, said that the July figure\nwas 70 percent and that the airline might be profitable for the\nmonth of August.\n\n   But it is unlikely that Sun Country can maintain that\nperformance in the fall, when leisure travel traditionally drops.\nThe airline is still little known outside Minneapolis, where 85\npercent of its passengers now originate. It also does not offer\nfrequent-flyer benefits and must persuade skeptical travel agents\nthat it is a viable alternative to Northwest. Most Minneapolis\ntravel agents depend on Northwest for the bulk of their business\nand receive incentives from the airline if they book more of their\npassengers on Northwest.\n\n   Sun Country plans to introduce a frequent-flyer program soon,\nthough La Macchia said it would not be like those offered by other\nairlines. He explained that he wanted it to be more like the\n``relationship marketing'' he learned in Las Vegas, with prizes\nlinked to local merchants, like pizza chains.\n\n   Two Sun Country executives pointed out that it took five years\nfor Vanguard Airlines of Kansas City, Mo., and the Denver-based\nFrontier Airlines, two other low-price airlines, to begin to show\nprofits. Are the La Macchias willing to wait that long?\n\n   ``We are definitely in this thing for the long haul,'' La\nMacchia said. ``We are prepared to do what it takes.''\n","Headline":"\nFIRING ON FORTRESS NORTHWEST \n","Text":["\n   MINNEAPOLIS _ Most cities root unabashedly for their big\nhometown companies.
