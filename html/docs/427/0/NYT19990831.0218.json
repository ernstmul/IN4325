A warning\nlabel flashes across the television screen at the end of this\npublic service announcement: ``Exposure to the sun's UV rays can\ndamage your skin.''\n\n   As August melts into September, the public service announcement\nserves as a timely reminder: Just because summer is ending doesn't\nmean the sun isn't going to get you. And keep getting you. The PSA\nis part of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\nfive-year ``Choose Your Cover'' campaign, an effort co-sponsored by\nthe American Cancer Society Skin Protection Federation that urges\nAmericans to ``Slip! Slop! Slap!

Melanoma and basal and squamous cell carcinomas now occur\nmore frequently than all other cancers combined in the United\nStates and are increasing, with approximately 1 million new cases\nannually _ 80 percent of them linked to the sun's burning rays.\n\n   This year, 44,200 Americans are expected to learn that they have\nmalignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. That's up\n6 percent from 1998.\n\n   The increase in skin cancer appears to be related to increases\nin voluntary sun exposure. We're apparently asking for trouble.\n\n   Skin cancer experts say huge increases in weekend and childhood\nexposure to the sun's rays have made a big difference. Blasts of\nblistering exposure, especially in crucial early years of life, are\ntaking a lot of the blame for the increase.\n\n   The solution? What we've heard before, but obviously need to\nhear again: Protect your skin. The Department of Health and Human\nServices estimates that about one-third of adults take measures to\nprotect their skin from the sun's UV rays.\n\n   Three new polls show there is a lot we either don't know about\nskin cancer prevention or foolishly choose to ignore.\n\n   For example, although health professionals agree that children\nunder 6 months should not be exposed to the sun's harmful rays at\nall, more than 70 percent of people polled for Discovery Health\nMedia say they believe infants can be protected with sunscreen, and\n62 percent think, wrongly, that light-colored clothing offers the\ngreatest protection from the sun.\n\n   In fact, a typical dry, white cotton T-shirt offers only about\nan SPF level of 8 to 10, as does an SPF-15 sunscreen if applied\nonly sparingly. Closely woven, long-sleeved shirts provide the most\nprotection; wet T-shirts provide hardly any. Infants should never\nbe exposed directly to the sun, no matter how much sunscreen they\nhave on.\n\n   The poll also shows that Americans don't understand sun\nprotection factors (SPF) found in sunscreens. More than half\nbelieve incorrectly that sunscreen with an SPF of 30 offers twice\nthe protection of a sunscreen with SPF 15.\n\n   In a second poll, conducted in behalf of Cancer Care Inc., the\nmajority of respondents (82 percent) said they have experienced a\nserious sunburn that resulted in blistering or peeling, yet\nslightly more than half (52 percent) said they rarely or never\napply sunscreen to their exposed skin when planning to spend more\nthan 15 minutes outside in the sun.\n\n   Almost two-thirds of those polled said they have never been to a\ndermatologist to get their skin checked for abnormal moles. That\nsurvey also found that men are much less likely than women to apply\nsunscreen when they're outdoors, though more men are found to have\nmelanoma (and die from it) each year.\n\n   The third poll, conducted earlier this summer for the Cancer\nSociety's Youth Sun Exposure and Skin Protection Study, found\nalmost three-quarters (72 percent) of youths ages 11 to 18 get\nsunburned in the summer.\n\n   Dr. Martin Weinstock, chairman of the Cancer Society's Skin\nCancer Advisory Board, says the findings confirm that people do not\nuse sunscreen properly and do not take other measures to cover up\nwith hats and protective clothing.
