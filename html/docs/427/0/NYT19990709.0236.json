If you recognize yourself\nin the risk factors below, make doubly sure you slop on the\nslippery stuff:\n\n   _ Light eyes.\n\n   _ Fair skin.\n\n   _ Light hair.\n\n   _ Family history of skin cancer.\n\n   _ Chronic sun exposure throughout life.\n\n   _ Blistering sunburns as a child or adolescent.\n\n   Those at high risk should start getting annual skin-cancer\nscreenings in their early 20s. From then on, ``check your birthday\nsuit on your birthday,'' says dermatologist Donna Ann Zeide.\n\n   Sizing up skin cancer\n\n   Not sure if that mole is something to mull over? Remember the\nABCDE's of melanoma's warning signs:\n\n   Asymmetry _ One half of the mole does not match the other.\n\n   Border _ The edges are ragged, notched or blurred.\n\n   Color _ The pigmentation is not uniform, with variable degrees\nof tan, brown or black. Also look out for red, white or blue moles.\n\n   Diameter _ Diameter greater than 6 millimeters (or bigger than a\npencil eraser). Any increase in size should be of particular\nconcern.\n\n   Elevation _ The mole isn't flush with the surface of the skin.\n\n   ``But none of those things really tell the whole story,'' says\nDr. Ira Schlesinger.\n\n   When in doubt, have your dermatologist check it out.\n\n   And don't wait for a questionable area to hurt; skin cancers\nseldom cause pain.\n\n   Here comes the sunscreen\n\n   No need to adopt a vampire's aversion to the sun. Solar-smart\nfolks follow this advice:\n\n   Wear sunscreen every day, even if you're only going from house\nto car and car to office.\n\n   The range of products is wider than ever: spray-on sunscreens;\nstick sunscreens; sunscreens for acne sufferers; foundations or\nmoisturizers blended with sunscreens. Find a product you like and\napply it religiously.\n\n   ``There's no point in torturing yourself every day,'' says\ndermatologist Donna Ann Zeide says. Adds Schlesinger: ``If you're\nnot going to use it, it's not worth anything.''\n\n   Look for broad-spectrum UVA and UVB protection. The key\ningredients? Titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or Parsol 1789. And never\ndip below SPF 15.\n\n   ``It's like using a condom with a hole in it,'' Zeide says.\n``There's no point.''\n\n   Protect the oft-neglected eyelids, earlobes and lips. Women\ndevelop fewer skin cancers on their lips than men do because they\nenjoy the physical protection of lipstick.\n\n   Cover up your kids. Children especially need sunblock _\ntwo-thirds of sun damage happens before the age of 15. But don't\nput sunscreen on babies under 6 months of age; keep them out of\ndirect sunlight.\n\n   ``Parents know it's good to prevent sunburn, but they don't know\nit's good to prevent sun,'' Schlesinger says.\n\n   Replace your sunscreen annually. Unopened, sunscreen has a shelf\nlife of up to three years. Once opened, the SPF starts breaking\ndown. It's a good idea to buy new products at the beginning of each\nsummer.\n\n   Spray on your tan. For those who can't warm to the thought of\nalabaster skin, bronzing powders and self-tanning lotions now color\ncosmetic counters, and the new formulas forgo the telltale orange\ntint of yesteryear.\n\n   Complete all outdoor activities before 10 a.m. or start them\nafter 4 p.m. to avoid the sun at its strongest.\n\n   Get to know your skin. Practice self-exams to familiarize\nyourself with your own landscape. That way, you can more easily\nnotice mole changes such as growing, bleeding or crusting.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Everybody's free to wear sunscreen, but\nfor some bodies, it's an absolute must.
