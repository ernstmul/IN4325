Times News Service clients)  \n By NORM FRAUENHEIM  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX - The Dallas Mavericks have been called Suns East and\nthe Phoenix junior varsity. The two teams have more links than some\nfamilies have cousins.\n\n   Suns guard George McCloud has a home in Dallas. Mavericks\nforward Cedric Ceballos has one in Phoenix.\n\n   But these days, the Suns and Mavericks are linked by more than\njust a shared past. Their respective futures also are tied to one\nanother in what could become an interesting tug of war between\nex-colleagues.\n\n   It's a rivalry, all right. The stakes were created by a trade\nlast July, when the Suns acquired forward Pat Garrity and an\nunconditional first-round draft pick for playmaker Steve Nash.\n\n   The key is the draft pick.\n\n   The jury is out on Garrity. He's shown some promise, but it's\nimpossible to judge a rookie based on nine games.\n\n   Nash, a third-year guard, struggled through Dallas' first eight\ngames. In a loss Friday to Golden State and a victory Saturday over\nthe Los Angeles Clippers, he began to play with the efficiency of\nlast year, when he was a backup to Jason Kidd and Kevin Johnson.\nNash is still trying to adjust to a new team in an abbreviated\nseason after the chaotic NBA lockout.\n\n   ``I think I maybe didn't realize what a tough situation this\nis,'' said Nash, who faces former Phoenix teammates tonight in his\nfirst return to America West Arena since the trade. ``We had two\nweeks of training camp before we saw what was going to happen in a\ngame, and then, it's like wildfire.\n\n   ``This reminds me of my rookie year (1996-97) in Phoenix when we\nstarted 0-13. This team has a lot more life than that team. But\nit's going to be a tough season.''\n\n   Nash struggled with a foot injury during the off-season and then\nmissed 40 of his first 50 attempts from the floor. He since has hit\non 14 of 22 attempts and displayed floor leadership that was a key\nto the Mavericks' first two victories. It's early, but he doesn't\nget the free pass given to Garrity.\n\n   Fair or not, Nash's playmaking ability will determine whether\nthe Suns get a lottery pick (No. 1 through No. 13) or a choice late\nin the first round of the next draft. If he plays better, the\nMavericks figure to win more. The more the Mavericks win, the later\nthe Suns will pick.\n\n   So Nash is still an important part of the Suns' future. But this\ntime, the Suns will be hoping for turnovers instead of assists.\n\n   The Suns have the option of giving the pick from Dallas or their\nown to the Chicago Bulls to complete the Luc Longley trade. They\nalso can wait until 2000 to give the Bulls a first-round pick.\n\n   At this stage it looks as if the Bulls will have to wait. The\npotential for a lottery pick has not gone unnoticed by the Suns.\nFact is, it was there long before Nash ever put on a Mavericks\nuniform.\n\n   The Mavericks have not been in the playoffs for eight years _ a\nfutility streak that is the NBA's longest. There's a solid chance\nit will grow to nine. The Mavericks are 2-9.\n\n   The Suns have adjusted their scouting strategy in the event of\npick among the first 13.\n\n   ``It changes a little bit,'' said Dick Van Arsdale, the Suns'\nsenior vice president for player personnel. ``We're not looking at\nit as though we might be able to find a player who could slip to\nthe 25th pick. We're looking for somebody who can play now. There's\na chance we could have a top pick.''\n\n   As the college season nears March Madness, the Suns' scouting\nprocess is in high gear. The club already is judging players\naccording to how they fit the Suns' needs.\n\n   ``We're being more specific,'' Suns scout Al Bianchi said.\n``We're zeroing in on the type of guys we might want.''\n\n   After just nine games, the Suns have found themselves to be\nwithout the sort of dynamic, athletic talent provided by Antonio\nMcDyess, who left Phoenix for Denver. There might not be a McDyess\namong the current college prospects, but there are great leapers\nand shooters.\n\n   ``The big guys, all seniors, are players we've pretty much put\non the back burner,'' Van Arsdale said. ``We're looking at the\nfirst 10 to 15 players. We like the Kobe Bryants of the world.''\n\n   Van Arsdale was referring to Bryant's athletic talent and not\nhis lack of college experience. The Suns are unlikely to expend a\nhigh pick on high school players. Their immaturity and uncertain\ndevelopment make the investment too risky.\n\n   But there are some intriguing prospects in the colleges.\n\n   Some names: Rhode Island small forward Lamar Odom, Auburn\nswingman Chris Porter, Duke power forward Elton Brand, Maryland\nguard Steve Francis and Connecticut guard Richard Hamilton.\n\n   ``With a top-five pick, you'd probably get a good player, one\nwho could play right away,'' Bianchi said.\n\n   But, for now, it all depends on what Dallas does.\n\n   Or doesn't do.  \n","Headline":"\nSUNS' FORTUNE TIED TO MAVS'MISFOR TUNE \n","Text":["\n   PHOENIX - The Dallas Mavericks have been called Suns East and\nthe Phoenix junior varsity.
