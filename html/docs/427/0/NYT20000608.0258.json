CHANDLER  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n\n  \n\n   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Superman, watch out: A University of Rochester\nscientist is developing technology that could someday make ``super\nvision'' a reality for almost anyone.\n\n   David Williams, professor of medical optics at the New York\nstate college, says his techniques if used in humans could push far\nbeyond merely correcting people's vision to the standard 20/20, and\nactually produce a kind of enhanced vision that could equal the\nlegendary sharp eyesight of eagles.\n\n   In addition, the research could lead to improved methods for\ndiagnosing some eye diseases and monitoring the progress of\ntreatment, Williams said.\n\n   Williams's techniques come from the same ones astronomers have\nused over the last few years to improve the sharpness of telescope\nimages. Williams is developing the concepts in his newly\nestablished Center for Vision Excellence at the university, and\ndescribed his research here Thursday at a meeting of the American\nAstronomical Society.\n\n   Williams ``has been way out in front, exploring how we could\nenhance people's vision beyond what is normally thought of as\nperfect vision,'' said Scott MacRae, a cornea specialist and\npioneer in refractive surgery who has joined Williams at the new\nvision center. ``In the old days, we were just trying to correct\npeople's vision problems and treat disease. This new research takes\nwhat we consider normal vision and enhances it. This is truly\nrevolutionary.''\n\n   While the researchers stress that the work is still in an early\nstage and any real applications to human vision are a few years\naway, it already attracted the interest of the contact lens company\nBausch & Lomb, which has licensed the technology and is working\nwith the university to develop it.\n\n   The key to the new method is the use of a device that shines\ndozens of narrow light beams into the eye. The beams are reflected\nback out and collected by a ``wavefront sensor'' so that computers\ncan then analyze in detail the tiny imperfections in the eye's\ncornea and lens.\n\n   Traditional vision correction deals with the overall average\nshape of the cornea and lens, but the equipment used is unable to\ndetect or correct the smaller-scale variations picked up by the\nadaptive optics method. The kind of subtle imperfections in the\nlens and cornea that are detected by this system are so small that\nphysicians didn't even know they existed until Williams's lab\ndeveloped this technique.\n\n   When you look through this laboratory system, Williams said,\n``The world looks crisper. In some people, the ability to pick up\ncontrast, such as minute patterns of stripes, is increased by a\nfactor of six. It allows for a level of vision correction that's\njust not available today. It's like needing glasses and getting\nthem for the first time. Everything suddenly looks sharper and\nclearer, no matter how good your eyes are normally.''\n\n   Ultimately, Williams said, the system should make it possible to\nperform a detailed analysis of an individual's eyes and produce\ncustomized glasses or contact lenses _ or perhaps even customized\nlaser surgery _ designed to correct all of these subtle\nimperfections.\n\n   He said that experiments show the system could lead to a\ndoubling, or better, of the amount of detail that humans could see,\nthus nearly equaling the visual acuity of eagles and other\npredatory birds.\n\n   The improvements should be even more dramatic in the case of\nnight vision, Williams said. While his tests have shown that the\nupper limit of human vision as measured by standard vision tests is\nabout 20/10, or about double the sharpness of ``normal'' vision,\nthe effects of these corrections are most pronounced in night\nvision because the iris is wide open and more of the eye's lens is\nused, exposing more of its imperfections. This effect is not\nreflected in the usual vision tests.\n\n   Tests have shown that the normal maximum detail the human eye\ncan see is a grid of 60 lines per degree. Cats have much poorer\nvision, able to see only about 5 lines per degree, while predatory\nbirds can see as many as 150 lines per degree.\n\n   Part of the reason for the sharp-eyed vision of eagles lies in\nthe superior lenses of their eyes, which can be matched by the new\ncorrection methods. But eagles also have smaller, more closely\nspaced light receptors on their retinas, which cannot be\nduplicated, Williams said.\n\n   As a side benefit of his research, Williams has been able for\nthe first time to take pictures of the retinas of human subjects\nthat clearly show every individual cone _ the receptors that pick\nup light and color. Normally, the distortions of the eye's lens\nblur such images, making it impossible to distinguish the\nindividual cones. The only way such images could be obtained before\nwas by surgically removing the retina after the patient's death.\n\n   The research has also made it possible for the first time to\ndetect the three different kinds of cones, sensitive to different\ncolors of light, which make color vision possible, and to see how\nthese different cones are distributed through the visual field.\n\n   The arrangement and relative numbers of the cones for different\ncolors is quite random, and varies greatly among individuals. This\nis very different from the eyes of fish, for example, which show an\nabsolutely regular crystal-like pattern of color cones.\n\n   This method of viewing the detailed structure of the retina,\nWilliams said, could someday be used to monitor the progression of\ndiseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, which causes a slow\ndegeneration of the retina, and to observe directly the effects of\nexperimental treatments for the disease.\n\n   ``Ultimately, this could be a very useful clinical tool,''\nWilliams said.\n\n   Some of his experimental results were recently published in the\nJournal of the Optical Society of America, and a meeting last month\nof the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology devoted\na whole symposium to reports from Williams and other researchers on\nthe topic of ``enhanced vision.''\n\n   One of the pioneers of that telescope technology, Jerry Nelson\nof the University of California, who designed the innovative\noptical systems for the Keck telescopes in Hawaii _ the world's\nlargest telescopes _ visited Williams's lab this week.
