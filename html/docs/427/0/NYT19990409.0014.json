Times News Service clients)  \n By BOB YOUNG  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   SALT LAKE CITY _ Last week, when the Suns were in the midst of\nlosing five of six games, Suns Coach Danny Ainge looked over the\nNBA standings and said not much had changed for his team.\n\n   ``We're still one of five teams fighting for the last couple of\nplayoff spots in the West,'' Ainge noted.\n\n   That's where the Suns are tonight as they begin the 15-game\nstretch run against the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center.\n\n   But all things are not equal.\n\n   If the Suns are going to extend their streak of playoff\nappearances to 11 years, they're going to have to do it against\narguably the most difficult schedule of the teams fighting for the\nlast three of eight Western Conference playoff berths.\n\n   And that's only if some of the other contenders stumble against\nsome bad teams.\n\n   Otherwise, the Suns are headed to the draft with two lottery\npicks in a draft that's considered mediocre by many analysts _\ndepending on which underclassmen declare themselves eligible.\n\n   ``We have no time to be tired,'' guard Jason Kidd said after the\nSuns beat Minnesota _ one of those five teams Ainge spoke about _\non Wednesday night.\n\n   ``We've only got 15 games left. The most important thing is for\nus to make sure we're healthy and make sure we get into the\nplayoffs, and then we all start over again.''\n\n   It is no easy task. Here's how it breaks down for the Suns:\n\n   The Suns (17-18) play only seven of their final 15 games against\nteams that had sub-.500 records through Wednesday night's games.\nThey get Dallas twice, Seattle twice, Vancouver once, Denver once\nand Sacramento, which is on their heels, once.\n\n   The other eight games include three against the defending\nWestern Conference champion Jazz, two against San Antonio and\nMinnesota and one against Houston. They play seven of the 15 at\nhome, where they have struggled.\n\n   The Kings (15-20) appear to have the easiest path. First,\nthey've clinched a tiebreaker with Phoenix should the two end up\ntied.\n\n   The Kings play 12 of their final 15 against sub-.500 clubs,\nincluding three against the Nuggets, two against Vancouver and two\nagainst the Clippers. They get 11 of 15 games at home, where they\nare 7-7. However, they also are two games behind the Suns and three\nbehind Seattle in the loss column.\n\n   Seattle (17-17), which moved a half-game ahead of the Suns for\nthe No. 7 spot by beating Portland, 87-86, on Thursday night, has a\nschedule that's comparable to the Suns' in difficulty. The\nSuperSonics have 16 remaining, with nine against sub-.500 teams.\nSeven are at home, and they get the Clippers, Denver and Dallas\nonly once each, and Vancouver twice.\n\n   Golden State (14-21) has a mixed bag. The Warriors will play 11\nof 15 against sub.-500 teams, but they get only six of the 16 on\ntheir home court, where they are 10-9. The Suns have the tiebreaker\non the Warriors.\n\n   Minnesota (20-14), which played the Clippers in Los Angeles on\nThursday night, appears to be in the best shape to clinch. The\nTimberwolves had a 2{-game lead on the Suns before Thursday's game.\nTheir final 15 games include eight against sub-.500 teams and seven\ngames at home. The schedule includes one game each against the\nClippers, Dallas and Vancouver, and two against the Suns.\n\n   Of course, there are other ways to look at what the Suns face.\n\n   ``We play our best against the better teams, so maybe it will\nwork out better for us,'' guard Rex Chapman said.\n\n   The Suns also are the only team among the five with a winning\nrecord on the road. They have beaten Seattle, San Antonio and the\nLos Angeles Lakers on the road this season, and they've come close\ntwice in Portland.\n\n   With some luck, the Suns are capable of finishing the season\nwith a .500 record and extending the playoff run.\n\n   ``This is the part of the year when we need to step up our game\nto make that push for a playoff spot, whether it's the eighth spot\nor what,'' forward Clifford Robinson said. ``The important thing\nnow is for us to string some wins together.''  \n","Headline":"\nSCHEDULE DOES SUNS NO FAVORS IN PLAYOFF BID \n","Text":["\n   SALT LAKE CITY _ Last week, when the Suns were in the midst of\nlosing five of six games, Suns Coach Danny Ainge looked over the\nNBA standings and said not much had changed for his team.\n","\n   ``We're still one of five teams fighting for the last couple of\nplayoff spots in the West,'' Ainge noted.\n","\n   That's where the Suns are tonight as they begin the 15-game\nstretch run against the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center.\n","\n   But all things are not equal.\n","\n   If the Suns are going to extend their streak of playoff\nappearances to 11 years, they're going to have to do it against\narguably the most difficult schedule of the teams fighting for the\nlast three of eight Western Conference playoff berths.\n","\n   And that's only if some of the other contenders stumble against\nsome bad teams.\n","\n   Otherwise, the Suns are headed to the draft with two lottery\npicks in a draft that's considered mediocre by many analysts _\ndepending on which underclassmen declare themselves eligible.\n","\n   ``We have no time to be tired,'' guard Jason Kidd said after the\nSuns beat Minnesota _ one of those five teams Ainge spoke about _\non Wednesday night.\n","\n   ``We've only got 15 games left.
