One day while updating a\nprescription for contact lenses, her optician detected vision\ntrouble, prompting further examination. An ophthalmologist found a\nsmall cancerous tumor on her retina.\n\n   ``It was just really odd and scary to think that there's\nsomething like that in your eye that's just sitting there, and you\nhave no idea,'' says Rose. ``When that kind of news is delivered, I\nthink you do go into shock. I don't know if it still has sunk in.''\n\n   The tumor in Rose's eye creates a hole in her vision. Dr.\nWilliam Freeman, professor of ophthalmology at Shiley Eye Center at\nthe University of California, San Diego, says Rose can't see the\nhole because her brain compensates for the loss, ``telling'' her\nother eye to fill in the gap.\n\n   ``Your brain kind of wants there to be a full picture, and it\nfills it in,'' Freeman says.\n\n   Based on this phenomenon, Freeman and his research colleagues,\nin conjunction with Microvision Inc. of Bothell, Wash., developed a\nmachine that informs doctors precisely where vision is blocked,\nallowing a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of the problem.\nCalled entoptic perimetry, it borrows electronic display imaging\ntechnology first developed for military applications.\n\n   Among the mix of patients in trials, entoptic perimetry has been\nused to diagnose peripheral scotomas caused by cytomegalovirus\nretinitis, an opportunistic infection experienced by people in\nadvanced stages of AIDS.\n\n   ``What we have found in AIDS patients is that patients who are\ncompletely unaware that they have an infection in the retina can\nimmediately see that there's something wrong,'' Freeman says.\n\n   The test could also be used to diagnose vision problems among\nbrain tumor patients and others. ``When the doctor or your\npediatrician looks in the eye with a little hand-held\nophthalmoscope, that only shows him really the very center, he\nwould miss a retinal detachment, peripheral diabetes, tumors of the\nretina, and things like that,'' says Freeman.\n\n   RETINAL IMAGE PROJECTION\n\n   Daniel Plummer, Ph.D., visual psychophysicist at Shiley Eye\nCenter, says that when Rose looks into the lens of the testing\ninstrument with her bad eye, she sees an image projected directly\ninto her eye, an image similar to the ``snowstorm'' on a TV screen\nthat is not tuned in.\n\n   ``It's also cool that people are looking inside this machine\nwhich doesn't have a screen inside of it, and yet they're seeing\nthe computer monitor inside their eye,'' says Plummer.\n\n   The exam also increases patient awareness and responsibility in\ntreating their disease, serving to motivate patients to stick to\ntheir drug regimen in cases when the eye can be healed. ``If you\nbreak your leg, you know that your leg is broken. Something hurts.\nYou have pain. They're able to suddenly somehow understand what's\ngoing on in the retina and why they need treatment,'' says Plummer.\n\n   In the test, dots projected onto the eye move so fast that the\nbrain doesn't have time to fill in the missing parts of vision. In\na darkened exam room, staring into the examination lens, the only\none in the world, Rose is asked about the relative location of the\nhole that she perceives.\n\n   ``They draw on the computer monitor where they see the defect,''\nsays Freeman, considered a retinal specialist. ``That corresponds\nvery closely to exactly where the tumor or infection, or whatever\nit is, on the retina.''\n\n   With the test, Rose reports a black hole toward the side of her\nvision. ``That whole area was blocked out,'' she says. ``It's just\na dark triangle. It's just black. So you would think that I\nwouldn't be able to see out of that corner of my eye or that I\nwould notice the blockage.'' Doctors estimate she had been\nsuffering the condition for a year.\n\n   The test takes under a minute, and early studies show it's\nhighly accurate, with a detection sensitivity figures of 95 percent\nand specificity of greater than 95 percent. While the test is\npresently only available in the San Diego area, the researchers\nhope it will become a standard test used by optometrists and other\neye care practitioners when it becomes widely available, most\nlikely in 2001.\n\n   Insurance companies have yet to announce whether they'll cover\nthe cost.\n\n   -----\n\n   (The HealthSurfing.com Web site at http://healthsurfing.com\ncontains further information.)\n\n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)\n","Headline":"\nCOMPUTER FINDS HIDDEN VISION PROBLEMS  \n     \n","Text":["\n   Shannon Rose can see the recipes in the cookbook she uses, but\nher right eye isn't seeing the full page.
