ANASTASI  \n c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  \n\n   LOS ANGELES _ You've wanted to fish. You have no idea how.\n\n   This story's for you.\n\n   Know the difference between an improved clinch knot, a Palomar\nknot and a forget-me-not? Read no further.\n\n   Have you ever kept nightcrawlers in your refrigerator? Do you\neven know that nightcrawlers are !ital!worms?!off! Answer yes, and\nthere's nothing here for you.\n\n   Can you tell a treble hook from a treble clef? A rod from A-Rod?\n\n   Stop, stop, stop.\n\n   This is a story for those who've never been but always wanted to\ngo.\n\n   Trout season opens April 29 in the Eastern Sierra, and it's\nexpected to be the best opener in years. You will catch fish\nbecause anyone can catch fish on this day. Al Davis will limit out.\nDonald Sterling will limit out. Susan Lucci will limit out, on\nSaturday.\n\n   Trout fishing is the easiest fishing, yet among the most\nenjoyable. The Eastern Sierra - the place our water comes from - is\nfantastically gorgeous. You don't need a lot of money. You don't\nneed a lot of time. You can drive there in time to eat your next\nmeal. Yes, there are a bazillion people but there are a bazillion\nfish and plenty of space.\n\n   Welcome to the great outdoors.\n\n   For at least one weekend, even the most-urban corporate warrior\namong you can imagine what it might have been like to be a pioneer.\n\n   What do I need?: For starters, a fishing license (fee: $28.10),\navailable at most sporting-goods stores. In California, your\nlicense must be visible as you fish; you can buy a nifty holder\nthat you can pin to your shirt. And you can keep no more than five\ntrout a day. There are fishing cops, called game wardens, who will\ngive you a very expensive ticket if you don't follow fishing rules.\nA copy of the regulations is available at the same place you buy\nyour license.\n\n   And then: A rod and reel. If you're over 12, don't buy a\nspincasting outfit. You want spinning gear, a rod that releases\nline using your index finger.\n\n   Buy the cheapest rod you can that doesn't have line already spun\non the reel. You're not advanced enough yet to appreciate the\ndifference from a more-expensive outfit, but the pre-spun reels\ntend to cause a lot of problems for anglers who don't have a lot of\npractice casting.\n\n   Casting?: Do I need an agent?!off! You do need a little\npractice, maybe 10 minutes to master the basic over-handed throw.\nGo online to www.gofishing.org for instruction.\n\n   Now what?: Now buy your ``stuff.'' Every angler has way more\nstuff than he actually needs or uses, but that's part of the\nunwritten code of angling that you will learn soon enough.\n\n   There are two ways to attract fish: lures, which one casts and\nreels in to simulate something swimming in the water (an insect or\nvery small fish, for example) and bait, which lies still. There's\nartificial bait like PowerBait, the most popular brand of trout\nattractant, and organic bait, such as worms and salmon eggs.\n\n   In an atmosphere like the Eastern Sierra, they all work roughly\nas well.\n\n   Why's that?: Because the state's Department of Fish and Game\nraises and then ``plants'' millions of trout in the Eastern Sierra\nevery year. It puts more than 400,000 trout in Crowley Lake alone.\nThey're hungry.\n\n   What kind of bait?: Get a jar of PowerBait (green is a\nfavorite), a jar of pink salmon eggs and a cup of nightcrawlers.\nStart with the PowerBait and go from there.\n\n   And lures?: When you're comfortable with bait fishing, you can\ntry casting lures. It can be more rewarding and engaging, but it's\neasier to mess up. Buy these trout staples: Thomas Buoyant, Rooster\nTail, Super Duper, Kastmaster and Rapala.\n\n   How do I attach it?: You need to know how to tie a basic knot,\nthe Palomar being the easiest (illustration this page; you can also\nbuy knot-tying pamphlets at sporting goods stores). The lure or\nhook attaches via what's called a swivel snap. Buy a package of\nthose, too.\n\n   With baits, you'll need to use a leader. Basically, you attach a\nsmall weight to the end of your line. From that, you attach a\n3-foot-or-so line with the hook attached to the end. The weight\nwill fall to the bottom of the water, and the bait will float up.\n\n   That's a drag: Now, put 4-pound line on your reel (4-pound test,\nin angling parlance). What's 4-pound line? That means you should be\nable to land a fish weighing up to 4 pounds before it breaks,\nthough that's not really true. Skilled anglers can land much\nheavier fish.\n\n   Now set your drag (ask for help on this if you can't figure it\nout) to 1 pound. The drag controls the tension on the line. Imagine\na game of tug-o-war: 10 guys on one side and one on the other (the\none being the fish) is a heavy drag, two guys on one side and one\non the other is a light drag.\n\n   The proper way to set your drag is to hang a 1-pound weight to\nyour line; when it starts the reel spinning, you're there.\n\n   Why does that matter?: Lighter line means less line that's\nvisible to fish; also the lighter the line and the lighter the\ndrag, the better the fish's fight.\n\n   Why do you want the fish to fight? Because that's the fun of\nfishing. If you want only to pull the fish out of the water easily,\ngo to Ralphs.\n\n   What do I wear?: Whatever you want, but the key is to be\nprepared for everything. It can be sunny and 85 degrees in L.A. and\nsnowing in the Eastern Sierra. It also can be sunny and 85 degrees\nthere. Be prepared for snow, rain and sunshine. Bring sunscreen.\nSkin-burning UV rays bounce off the snow and water; it can be 45\ndegrees while you're being seriously burned.\n\n   Where do I go?: The Eastern Sierra is a straight shot up Highway\n395, which is off the Antelope Valley Freeway (14). If you don't\nknow where to go, head for Crowley Lake. It's the most accessible,\nmost well-stocked and largest fishery. Figure six hours to drive\nthere, and figure plenty of CHP presence.\n\n   I'm there, now what?: Toss in your line with PowerBait, and\nwait. You will feel your line tug when a trout is nibbling. When\nthe pole bounces, ``set'' your hook; that is, hook the fish. Do\nthat easiest by yanking upward. Remember this is a trout, not a\nshark; you don't need to yank too hard.\n\n   I have nothing: Give a spot 15 minutes; if you don't have\nanything, move on. PowerBait !ital!will!off! work if there's fish,\ngenerally. Still no luck? Switch baits and lures. You never know\nthe mood of the fish.\n\n   I've got one: Play the fish. Reel gently and steadily. If the\nfish fights, let it go. Wait until it tires and reel again. Keep\npressure on the line. If the fish swims right, point your rod left\nand vice versa.\n\n   Fish aren't stupid: Fish do have eyes. If you make a commotion\nas you approach, they will probably swim to somewhere where things\nappear calmer. Skilled anglers actually sneak up to their spots\nbecause they know big fish don't get that way by sticking around\nwhen there's trouble.\n\n   But some people are: It is most definitely uncool to intrude\nupon someone else's fishing space - defined here as the distance\none can cast on all sides. If that person is catching fish after\nfish, and you're not, that's too bad. Get there earlier next time.\n\n   Need a bribe?: Mammoth Mountain has a small, yet respectable\noutlet mall. And spring skiing is great, with a 7- to 10-foot base\nat Mammoth.\n\n   And lastly: Fishing is like anything else: It takes a little\nknowledge and practice. Give yourself some time.\n","Headline":"\nTROUT FISHING MADE EASY FOR ROOKIES\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ You've wanted to fish.
