Times News Service clients)  \n \n      Between the dark and the day light, \nWhen the night is beginning to lower, \nComes a pause in the day's occupa tions, \nThat is known as the children's hour. \n _ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  \n By BARBARA YOST  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\nWhen night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour begins.\n\n   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's\nplaytime is just beginning. Under the moon light, he races his\nbike, catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom.\n\n   Sunshine is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would\ncause his skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill\nhim.\n\n   Collin, 9, is a child of the night.\n\n   Born with a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, in\nwhich the cells of the body lack the ability to repair DNA damage\nfrom ultraviolet rays, Collin's best chance for survival is to\navoid all sunlight.\n\n   Windows in his family's Gilbert home are tinted and covered with\nblinds. The family van is outfitted with blackout curtains. When\nCollin goes outside during the day, he is swaddled head to toe in\nlong sleeves, long pants and a cap with a flap in the back that\nmakes him look like the youngest soldier in the French Foreign\nLegion. He huddles under a blanket.\n\n   His parents, Cindy and Tony Cassinat, estimate their son is ex\nposed to no more than five minutes of sunshine a week.\n\n   ``Bad'' is how Collin describes his sheltered life. Yet he's a\nbright, chipper youngster with an impish personality and no lack of\nfriends. Two little girls have appointed themselves his escorts\nbetween school buildings when he is wrapped so tightly against the\nsun he can't see through his protective garb.\n\n   At recess, classmates vie for the chance to stay indoors with\nCollin and play field hockey in the halls.\n\n   He admits there are advantages to having XP.\n\n   ``I get spoiled,'' he said with a grin, ``by my teacher, then my\nmama, then my dad, then my principal.''\n\n   Collin was once invited to a sleep-over at the Phoenix Zoo.\n\n   Last summer he went to Camp Sundown in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where\nyoung campers with XP enjoyed indoor activities during the day and\nplayed outside long into the night.\n\n   But sitting alone in a darkened van parked where he can watch\nhis sister's soccer practice, his eyes get a bit teary as he counts\ndown the minutes until sunset when he can break out of the van and\nrun free.\n\n   At 5:34 p.m., the Collin hour begins.\n\n   Cindy Cassinat first noticed something alarming about her third\nson in February 1989. Six weeks old, Collin had been sitting\noutside in his stroller, bundled against the chill. The next day he\nappeared to have eczema on his cheeks _ crusty, scabby, oozing\npatches.\n\n   With a little research, Cindy learned that sunlight could help\ndry up eczema, so she took Collin outside again. When the\n``eczema'' spread to his arms, her pediatrician prescribed a\ncortisone salve.\n\n   Diagnosis: Fair Irish skin. Treat ment: Keep that boy out of the\nsun.\n\n   Collin spent his toddler years covered in sunscreen, playing in\ndoors or in the shade. He wore hats and long-sleeved shirts. ``His\nskin was always dry and cracky a little bit,'' Tony Cassinat said.\n\n   In 1995, Cindy read a newspaper article about Julian Nieves\nArmenta, a 4-year-old Mexican boy being treated for XP at Maricopa\nMedical Center and introduced at a Univer sity of Arizona medical\nsymposium. Multiple skin cancers covered his head and dotted his\neyeballs.\n\n   Julian's condition, minus the nu merous malignancies, sounded re\nmarkably like Collin's, Cindy thought.\n\n   A UA dermatologist confirmed her suspicions. In 20 years of\npractice in pediatric dermatology, Dr. Ron Han sen had seen just\ntwo cases of XP. Julian was one. Collin was the other. Most doctors\ndon't see any.\n\n   Only about 130 cases exist in the country, with an estimated\n1,000 worldwide. Collin's is the only known case in Arizona, the\nCassi nats say.\n\n   Extreme freckling and photopho bia _ severe discomfort in the\nsun _ are the earliest symptoms. Those signs should be detected by\nage 1 or 2; then protection can begin. ``We're talking a nocturnal\nperson,'' Hansen said. ``Even a minute or two of sun is enough DNA\ndamage to have skin cancers.''\n\n   Sunscreen is a puny weapon.\n\n   Armed with a diagnosis, the Cassinats devoted themselves to\nshielding Collin and instilled in him a sense of self-protection.\nIf some one opens a window or raises a shade, he'll cry out,\n``You're killing me!'' Cindy said with a laugh.\n\n   Sadly, his cries are all too true.\n\n   Undiagnosed and unprotected, children with XP usually die by the\nage of 10. Protected, they can enjoy a life expectancy of about 20\nyears.\n\n   Thanks to his parents, Collin should have nearly a normal life\nspan, Hansen said: ``Collin will do much better. They were very\ncare ful.''   \n`NOT ONE TO MOPE'\n\n   At Greenfield Elementary School, third-grader Collin blends in\nwith the other pupils. Only his UV-protective jacket gives him\naway.\n\n   Classroom windows are shaded, doors to the outside kept shut.\nCollin spends his day inside, except for a weekly dash to the\nbuilding next door where art classes are held. That's when Diana\nHancock and Amanda Schreck guide their friend across campus. ``They\nhelp me so I don't run into stuff,'' Collin said.\n\n   Sometimes he does run into stuff _ the school, a tree. Sometimes\nhe trips. But he picks himself up and forges on.\n\n   ``He is not one to mope,'' said his teacher, Sue Villa. ``He\ndoesn't feel sorry for himself. . . . He's a great little kid.''\n\n   Villa takes Collin's special needs in stride. When the school\nhad its fall festival, she arranged indoor events. When the class\nwas man dated to clean up school grounds for a lesson in ecology,\nshe sent them to the cafeteria to pick up trash. She creates indoor\nscience projects.\n\n   ``There are always other ways to do it,'' she said.\n\n   Collin's future in school is uncer tain. When he graduates to\nGreen field Junior High School in three years, his parents will\nhave to evaluate the facility for safety. Are windows tinted? Will\nall classes be in one building?\n\n   The Cassinats pray the next school will be as accessible as this\none. Cindy pulls her van as close as possible to the front door at\nGreen field Elementary, and Collin races in. Once, when the\ndriveway was blocked by a van collision, she commandeered the\ndelivery en trance.\n\n   ``We hope we can continue in a normal school,'' Tony said.\n``That's very important.''\n\n   If the junior high proves unac ceptable, the Cassinats won't\nhesi tate to ask for modifications to protect their son. If the\nbuilding can't meet their needs, they'll be forced to home school\nhim, further isolating a boy who already lives a life apart.   \nA CALCULATED SCHEDULE\n\n   The odds that Collin would be born with XP are phenomenal. To\nproduce the condition, both parents must be carriers of an aberrant\nrecessive gene. The chances of one partner being a carrier are one\nin 250,000.\n\n   Somehow, fate determined that Cindy, who grew up in California,\nand Tony, a native of Wyoming, should meet, marry and have four\nchildren. And one of those children would inherit a pair of XP\ngenes.\n\n   News of that genetic fluke came as a blow, Tony says.\n\n   ``They look at you and say your son can not go outside any more.\nThe next day we told the kids. That was hard.''\n\n   Although Tony insists Collin's needs don't control their lives,\nthey live on a calculated schedule.\n\n   On any given day, Cindy knows exactly when the sun sets. Collin\nheads outside 10 minutes later. In the summer, that can be as late\nat 8 p.m.\n\n   There have been just two family vacations _ to Lake Tahoe in\n1996 and to Camp Sundown last year.\n\n   While his two brothers, Chris, 16, and Craig, 12, and sister\nCourtney, 8, are hooked on sports, Collin shines in the chess club.\n\n   Visiting a restaurant before sunset means wrapping Collin ``like\na soft taco,'' Cindy said, and ignoring the stares of patrons. The\nexplanation, when asked for, is that the boy is allergic to the\nsun.\n\n   Shortly after Collin's diagnosis, the family moved from a\n1,100-square foot house into a new 4,000-square-foot house, quadru\npling Collin's indoor world. With living room furniture kept\nsparse, he was allowed to roller skate inside until the wheels\nbecame too dirty. Tracks in the carpeting were a small price to pay\nto let a boy burn off energy.\n\n   But Collin still lives life upside down. When other children are\nplaying outside, he's peering at them from his front window. When\nhe's outside, his friends are already in for the night.\n\n   ``It's a sunshine world out there,'' Tony said. ``People open\ntheir windows and let the sun shine in. This goes against what\nsociety is brought up with.''\n\n   Because XP is so rare, little scientific research is being done.\nFor the time being, treatment means vigilance.\n\n   ``The word is `no sun.' We make judgment calls on what is worth\nwhile,'' Tony said.\n\n   The Cassinats are scrupulous about checking Collin's skin for\nsuspicious spots. So far, he's had more than 30 removed; 20 were\ncancerous.\n\n   ``We're used to it,'' Cindy said, ``but we wish they wouldn't\nkeep popping up.''\n\n   Still, Collin is lucky. Some chil dren with XP suffer blindness,\nhearing loss, neurological impair ment and mental retardation, al\nthough the connection is unclear. Despite some minor learning disa\nbilities, Collin is smart and healthy.\n\n   For a boy whose enemy is the sun, Arizona would seem the evil\nempire. In truth, the Valley of the Sun is Collin's best friend.\nPhoenix has no more ultraviolet rays than cloudy Seattle. Clouds do\nnot block UV rays.\n\n   And where else could a boy play outside after dark all year\nround? Not Minnesota. Not North Dakota.   \nSUPPORT GROUP OF 1\n\n   Because Collin is the only child with XP in Arizona, there is no\none with whom to commiserate. He is a support group of one.\n\n   Cindy said, ``You're looking at XP-AZ right here.''\n\n   The Internet (www.xps.org/) is the Cassinats' link to XP parents\nacross the country. At Camp Sun down, they learned families cope as\nbest they can with the rare illness, keeping abreast of the few\ndevelop ments in the field.\n\n   A UV monitor, which detects ultraviolet rays, can alert parents\nto dangerous levels of sunlight. But it is an expensive tool the\nCassinats can't afford.\n\n   Another promising innovation is a pint-size space suit developed\nby NASA. When perfected, it will shield children from UV light out\ndoors. Although several models have been constructed, however, the\nXP Society has not yet endorsed any design, believing current suits\noffer only a false sense of security.\n\n   Collin tries to be patient.\n\n   ``He wants one,'' Cindy said. ``He asks for one all the time.''\n\n   Playing outside during daylight hours is still only a dream for\nCollin.\n\n   The reality can break a mother's heart.\n\n   ``I don't get down,'' Cindy said, ``but I can just start\nthinking about him and start crying.''\n\n   ``I never ask, `Why us?' '' she said, with a smile she's been\npracticing for a decade, sustained by the words of a friend who\ntold her, `` `He's here for a very important reason. He has this\ndisease for a very important reason.' ''\n\n   After sunset, those reasons mean little to a boy at play. Collin\nhas captured a toad, and in his victory, the child of the night\ncomes alive.  \n","Headline":"\nSUN IS DEADLY ENEMY FOR GILBERT 9-YEAR-OLD\n","Text":["\n   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's\nplaytime is just beginning.
