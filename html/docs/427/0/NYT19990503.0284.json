(af)  \n By ANDREW POLLACK   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   A drug activated by shining light into the eye could offer hope\nfor people suffering from age-related macular degeneration, the\nleading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly.\n\n   The condition, a deterioration of the retina, affects an\nestimated 25 percent of Americans over the age of 65. It is now\nvirtually untreatable.\n\n   But in a clinical trial involving about 600 patients, 61.4\npercent of those who took the drug, known as Visudyne, had vision\nthat was either stable or improved after one year, compared with\n45.9 percent of patients in a comparison group.\n\n   While such results show only modest effectiveness, ``when you\nhave a modest difference for a huge disease it's pretty\nimportant,'' said Dr. Neil M. Bressler, a professor of\nophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\nand the principal investigator in the trial.\n\n   Indeed, announcement of the results touched off a huge gain in\nthe stock of the drug's developer, QLT Phototherapeutics of\nVancouver, Canada. QLT intends to apply to the Food and Drug\nAdministration for approval to sell the Visudyne in partnership\nwith Ciba Vision, a division of Swiss drug giant Novartis AG.\n\n   Macular degeneration gradually destroys the macula, the central\npart of the retina that picks up the finest details of what people\nsee. People with the condition experience a partial or complete\nloss of central vision.\n\n   They usually can still see out of the side of the eye, but such\nperipheral vision is often not sharp enough to allow them to read,\nwatch television, recognize faces or drive.\n\n   Some 80 percent to 90 percent of cases are of the so-called dry\nform, in which yellow deposits accumulate on the retina. The more\nserious wet form is marked by the growth of abnormal, leaky blood\nvessels behind the retina.\n\n   Visudyne is only for the wet form, which, while less common,\naccounts for most of the cases of blindness caused by the\ncondition. The company estimates there are 200,000 new cases of the\nwet form diagnosed in North America each year.\n\n   The only treatment now available is to destroy the blood vessels\nwith a laser. But this treatment is suitable for only a small\npercentage of patients. Also, the laser can injure healthy cells.\n\n   But photodynamic therapy, as the use of light-activated drugs is\ncalled, ``is more like a smart missile,'' said Dr. Richard B. Rosen\nof the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.\n\n   Visudyne accumulates preferentially in the fast-growing blood\nvessels behind the retina. The drug is given intravenously, and\nabout 15 minutes later a red laser is shined into the eye for about\na minute and a half. The drug is activated and destroys the\nabnormal cells while doing little damage to surrounding tissue.\n\n   Photodynamic therapy has been used with limited success against\ncancer, but it appears to be finding its niche in macular\ndegeneration. Miravant Medical Technologies of Santa Barbara,\nCalif., is testing another light-activated drug for macular\ndegeneration, in partnership with Pharmacia & Upjohn.\n\n   Dr. Julia G. Levy, president of QLT, said her inspiration came\nin part from the fact that her own mother, who has since died, got\nthe disease at 85 and three years later could not watch television\nor read.\n\n   ``She used to try to convince herself she could see better than\nshe could,'' Dr. Levy recalled. ``She didn't want people to know\nshe couldn't see.''\n\n   Many desperate patients are expected to flock to Visudyne if it\nis approved. But some experts say the trial results were not that\nimpressive. Even when vision was stabilized, meaning a loss of\nfewer than three lines on a standard eye chart, it rarely improved.\n\n   Only 16 percent of treated patients registered an improvement of\nat least one line on the eye chart, compared with 7 percent in the\ncontrol group. Moreover, the stabilization does not appear to be\npermanent and the drug cannot repair already-damaged retinal\ntissue.\n\n   Other possible treatments being tested include radiation\ntherapy, surgery and anti-angiogenesis drugs, which block the\nformation of blood vessels and have attracted attention as a new\napproach to cancer therapy.\n\n   While a cure remains elusive, Bressler said, ``We'll chip away\nslowly and surely and make the quality of life for these people\nbetter.''\n","Headline":"\nDRUG OFFERS HOPE FOR ELDERLY WITH EYE DISEASE \n","Text":["\n   A drug activated by shining light into the eye could offer hope\nfor people suffering from age-related macular degeneration, the\nleading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly.\n","\n   The condition, a deterioration of the retina, affects an\nestimated 25 percent of Americans over the age of 65.
