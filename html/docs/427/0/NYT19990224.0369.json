Times News Service   \n\n   After wearing glasses for 31 years, Debrah Ward jumped at a\nchance last May to give them up. Instead of receiving laser\nsurgery, an alternative to contact lenses and eyeglasses, Ms. Ward\nhad clear polymer arcs implanted in her near-sighted right eye.\n\n   The arcs, known as Intacs, are an experimental treatment made by\nKeravision, a tiny California company. The arcs, which can be\ninserted during a 10-minute procedure in an ophthalmologist's\noffice, flatten the cornea to correct mild nearsightedness, or\nmyopia, a condition that affects some 22 million Americans.\n\n   ``I never had vision this good,'' said Ms. Ward, a 38-year-old\naccountant in Olathe, Kan., who took part in the Intacs clinical\ntrials. Her eyesight improved from 20/20 with glasses to 20/10 with\nthe implants. ``It's nothing short of amazing,'' she said. ``I've\ngone around and told all my friends about it.''\n\n   If the Food and Drug Administration, as expected, approves\nIntacs this spring, it will be the first surgical corneal implant\nfor vision correction to be sold in the United States. At the same\ntime, companies like Bausch & Lomb, the contact lens giant, and\nStaar Surgical, a small California concern, are racing to develop\nother types of eye implants, technologies that are similar to\nIntacs and essentially are permanent contact lenses.\n\n   Still other developments are under way. Presby Corp., a tiny\nbiotechnology company in Dallas, is developing a plastic implant\nthat would eliminate the need for reading glasses and bifocal\nlenses. Early clinical trials are set to begin in the United States\nnext month. All these products, which could be available in the\nnext several years, are aimed at grabbing a share of the $11\nbillion Americans now spend each year for glasses and contact\nlenses.\n\n   While doctors and analysts are leery of predicting how popular\nvision-corrective implants may become _ they will cost as much as\n$2,500 an eye and they involve surgery _ their development is a\nresult of the recognition that many graying baby boomers are eager\nto spend lots of money to turn back the effects of time.\n\n   The excitement last year over Viagra, Pfizer Inc.'s impotency\npill, showed that there was an increasing demand among middle-aged\nAmericans for medical treatments that make their lives easier and\nmore fulfilling.\n\n   Americans increasingly are willing to undergo cosmetic surgery,\nthe kind of procedure needed to wear optical implants. Americans\nhad 697,000 cosmetic operations in 1996, the latest year that\nstatistics are available, according to the American Society of\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgeons _ a 71.6 percent increase from\n1992.\n\n   Thomas M. Loarie, Keravision's chief executive, says he expects\nthat many of his customers will be 38 to 42 years old, who have no\nproblem spending on cosmetic surgery.\n\n   ``This age group has more income,'' he said. ``They are not\nafraid of trying something new.''\n\n   Many analysts also say that Americans may snap up implants\nbecause they increasingly are becoming frustrated with contact\nlenses. After expanding for years, the contact-lens market in the\nUnited States is barely growing. The number of annual replacement\nsoft contact-lens wearers, who account for 36 percent of the\nmarket, declined 7.9 percent last year. The only boom in the market\nis for daily disposable soft contacts, sales of which increased 44\npercent last year.\n\n   ``Intacs should have a broad appeal,'' said Katherine\nMartinelli, an analyst with S.G. Cowen Securities Corp. ``People\nwon't have to worry about cleaning or replacing them. One of the\nkeys is that the products are going to have to be able to work in\nbroad range of people.''\n\n   But the potential seen in implants comes with a number of\ncaveats.\n\n   Given the manufacturers' small size _ Keravision had only\n$835,000 in sales last year _ analysts are worried that the\ncompanies lack the resources to make their products best sellers.\nEven after an FDA advisory panel recommended Intacs for approval\nlast month, shares of Keravision, which is based in Fremont,\nCalif., continue to trade below their July 1995 initial offering\nprice of $13.50. The shares closed Wednesday at $12.0625 in Nasdaq\ntrading.\n\n   Possible side effects and complications range from blurred\nvision with Intacs to a slim risk of cataracts with the Staar\nSurgical lens. The implants are expensive, costing some $5,000 for\nsurgery to both eyes. Only 2,000 people have Intacs worldwide,\nleaving their long-term safety unclear.\n\n   ``This is not a casual procedure,'' said Ken Taylor, a vice\npresident at Arthur D. Little, a corporate consulting and research\nfirm. ``Eyesight is very precious to people. They are going to have\nto be confident about the procedure and the product before they\nwill have it.''\n\n   So far, the implant technology has been received favorably by\ndoctors. Made of a clear polymer that is used to correct cataracts,\nIntacs are two arcs that are inserted surgically in the periphery\nof the cornea. The arcs flatten the cornea to correct vision\nprimarily between 20/40 and 20/300, a treatment that could be used\nby nearly one-third of the 70 million Americans who suffer from\nmyopia. The surgery takes about 10 minutes and requires a local\nanesthesia administered through eyedrops.\n\n   Insertion of Staar Surgical's intraocular contact lens, made of\na bendable polymer, takes about 20 minutes. Like Intacs, the lens\ncan be inserted in a ophthalmologist's office under local\nanesthesia, but the procedure is slightly more invasive. The\ncontact lens fits just over the eye's natural lens behind the iris.\n\n   Though several years away from market, Bausch & Lomb is\ndeveloping a lens that fits in front of the iris, a position that\ndoctors believe should reduce the risk of cataracts. The device has\ntwo thin Z-shaped arms with tiny foot plates to help hold it in\nplace.\n\n   Doctors say there is a slightly greater risk of infection from\nthe lens procedures, but their uses are far broader. Intacs\nprimarily correct mild nearsightedness, while the implanted lenses\nhave proved effective in early clinical trials as a remedy for a\ngreater range of myopia and farsightedness. With both procedures,\nthe implants can be easily removed. In the Intacs clinical trials,\nwhen the lenses were removed, the patient's eyesight went back to\nits uncorrected vision in most cases.\n\n   Melanie Yourdon, a 30-year-old registered nurse near Kansas\nCity, Kan., had Intacs implanted in her left eye two years ago as\npart of the trial. She became frustrated when she realized that her\nvision was not 20/20. When her doctor looked at her incision, he\nrealized that it had not healed properly. It took him 10 minutes to\nremove the Intacs implant.\n\n   ``My incision healed once the ring was out,'' said Ms. Yourdon,\nwho has worn Intacs in her right eye since 1994. ``My vision went\nback to what it was before, and I decided to have a laser\nprocedure. Now I see fine. The only thing is that when you go into\ncorrective eye surgery, you want to know that you'll have perfect\nvision when you come out of it.''\n\n   (MORE) Â  \n\n   Of the 410 people who were evaluated after a year in the Intacs\nclinical trials, 98 percent achieved 20/40 vision or better, while\n78 percent attained vision that was 20/20 or better. Especially\nnoteworthy was that 56 percent achieved 20/16 vision or better.\nEven though the data were not conclusive enough for the FDA\nadvisory panel to allow Keravision to state that Intacs provided\nbetter vision, the results still caught doctors' attention.\n\n   ``Getting better eyesight is a bonus with the rings,'' said Dr.\nR. Doyle Stulting, a professor of ophthalmology at Emory University\nin Atlanta who participated in the Intacs clinical trials.\n``There's no guarantee that the rings will give you vision that is\nbetter than what you had before with contacts or glasses. But when\npeople discover that there's something better out there, in this\ncase better than 20/20 vision, they'll want to have it.''\n\n   Staar Surgical also reported excellent results in early trials\nof its lens. In the trials' first phase, 9 of 10 patients who had\nbeen legally blind without glasses achieved 20/20 vision or better\nafter receiving an implanted lens. The company began the third\nphase of the trials last fall on some 300 patients.\n\n   But not all wearers of such implants may be thrilled with the\ndevices. Given the cost of the procedure, side effects, while\nminor, may prove a deterrent. Roughly 4.8 percent of the people in\nthe third phase of the Intacs clinical studies experienced\ndifficulty with night vision, while 2.9 percent reported blurry\nvision. Other side effects included seeing double images, glare,\nhalos and fluctuating distance vision.\n\n   The Staar Surgical lens caused no notable side effects during\nits early clinical trials. John R. Wolf, Staar Surgical's chairman,\nacknowledges that there is a slim chance that the lenses may cause\ncataracts as a complication from poorly performed surgery. A\nspokeswoman for Staar Surgical, which is based in Monrovia, Calif.,\nsaid that there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of cateracts\nin the 7,000 lenses that had been installed worldwide so far.\n\n   ``With the Staar lens, since it tucked underneath the iris, the\npatient is less likely to experience glare and halos,'' said Dr.\nSheri L. Rowen, director of the eye and cosmetic center at Mercy\nMedical Center in Baltimore. ``But you have to be gentle installing\nit. You don't want to move the lens around.''\n\n   Further reducing the allure of implants, patients still may need\nglasses following the procedure. ``Eventually, 100 percent of all\npeople need reading glasses,'' said Dr. Penny A. Asbell, a\nprofessor of opthamology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in\nManhattan who participated in the Intacs clinical trials. ``A\nnearsighted person who gets Intacs will also need them. There's no\nsurgical procedure yet that can change that.''\n\n   Doctors also share analysts' concerns about the small size of\nStaar Surgical and Keravision, the leading implant companies. Staar\nSurgical had sales last year of some $54.5 million compared with\nBausch & Lomb's $2.36 billion in sales and Johnson & Johnson's\n$23.6 billion. Keravision's finances are especially precarious. The\ncompany, which has yet to post a profit in its 13-year history,\ngets the majority of its financing from bond and stock offerings.\n\n   Given the size of Staar Surgical and Keravision, analysts have\nspeculated that either company could be acquired by a contact lens\ngiant, like Johnson & Johnson or Bausch & Lomb. Several analysts\nand doctors said they would applaud such a deal.\n\n   ``The big question here really is execution,'' Ms. Martinelli,\nthe Cowen Securities analyst, said. ``It's great technology, hands\ndown. But great technology does not always mean great sales.''\n","Headline":"\nANALYSTS AND DOCTORS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IMPLANTED EYE LENSES \n","Text":["\n   After wearing glasses for 31 years, Debrah Ward jumped at a\nchance last May to give them up.
