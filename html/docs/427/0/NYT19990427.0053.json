HOWE  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Laser eye surgery has become so effective and widely accepted\nfor correcting vision problems that more than 1 million Americans\nare expected to have the procedure done this year and next. But\nit's no surprise that many people still get squeamish hearing the\nwords ``eye,'' ``laser'' and ``cut'' in the same sentence.\n\n   Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration approved\nwhat may be an attractive new option for some mildly nearsighted\npeople leery of having part of their eye burned off: tiny plastic\nrings that are inserted on the edges of the cornea to flatten it\nand sharpen up the patient's view of distant things.\n\n   European and Canadian doctors have been implanting the Intacs\nrings for up to three years already. The main selling point is\nthat, unlike laser surgery, the procedure can be undone if patients\nare unhappy with their new vision.\n\n   However, many national eye specialists are skeptical the\nimplants will ever become more than a narrowly used alternative to\nlaser surgery. They cite several reasons: The rings cost as much or\nmore (roughly $2,000 per eye), installation hurts more, and for the\nforeseeable future they will fix only a small range of mild\nnearsightedness.\n\n   ``The advantages are few, and I bet in Boston it's going to be\nsomething that really doesn't take off,'' said Carmen A. Puliafito,\ndirector of the New England Eye Center in Boston and chairman of\nthe Tufts Medical School ophthalmology department, who performed\nMassachusetts' first laser eye surgery in December 1990.\n\n   Dr. Dimitri T. Azar, a top surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and\nEar Infirmary who has been to Paris to learn the procedure, said,\n``Our plan is to start very carefully and not jump into it, because\nthere could be some hidden surprises.''\n\n   At least for the first several months, Azar said, the infirmary\nwill require patients choosing rings to go to an operating room\nwith an anesthesiologist assisting, because of the pain of one\nmotion where the eye is simultaneously pulled and turned. The laser\neye surgeries can be done in a room set up like a dentist's office\nwith a reclining chair.\n\n   The potential market for any of the operations is immense.\nAccording to American Academy of Ophthalmology estimates, a quarter\nof all Americans are nearsighted and another 22 percent are\nfarsighted. Nearly 150 million people, the academy says, wear some\nkind of eyewear, including non-prescription reading glasses.\n\n   Since 1996, an estimated 500,000 Americans have paid for laser\nsurgery _ which virtually no health plan covers _ to reduce or\neliminate the need for contact lenses or eyeglasses. Currently, the\ntwo most frequently performed visual correction surgeries are\ncalled Lasik, which stands for laser-assisted in-situ\nkeratomileusis, and PRK, for photorefractive keratectomy.\n\n   People have trouble seeing either near or far because their eyes\nhave less than the optimal curvature to focus images on the retina,\nthe membrane at the back of the eye that receives visual images.\nBoth Lasik and PRK slightly reshape the surface of the eye, making\nit either flatter to improve distance vision or more steeply\npitched to improve near vision.\n\n   In PRK procedures, lasers guided by computer calculations shear\noff very thin layers of tissue _ a fraction of the thickness of a\npiece of paper usually _ from parts of the cornea surface to\nproduce a shape that yields clearer vision.\n\n   Lasik has been dubbed ``flap and zap'' because it involves a\nsurgeon using an automated cutting device like a carpenter's plane\nto slice an ultrathin flap from the surface of the eye, which is\npeeled back to allow a laser to vaporize tissue underneath.\n\n   The flap is then replaced and patients heal much faster than\nwith PRK, in perhaps two days instead of a week. Also, immediately\nafter leaving the operating chair patients see better instead of\nhaving to wait up to 20 days to know how their vision has been\nimproved, which is the case with PRK.\n\n   Neither technique is foolproof, however. Flap complications\noccur in about 1 to 2 percent of Lasik cases, but usually can be\nsurgically fixed. A comparably small percentage of people\nundergoing both types of operations complain about blurry vision,\nhalos, glare, problems seeing at night or are simply disappointed\nthe procedure didn't yield the improvement they hoped for,\naccording to several US studies.\n\n   Lasik is considered best suited to people with high to severe\nnearsightedness or farsightedness. It has boomed to more than 80\npercent of all eye surgeries since it was introduced in 1996,\naccording to Irving J. Arons, managing director of Spectrum\nConsulting in Peabody, Mass., a leading authority on the\neye-surgery market.\n\n   KeraVision, the Fremont, Calif., company that produces the new\nIntacs implants, apparently sees a market among people who dislike\nthe idea of making a permanent, irreversible change in their eyes\nor fear complications, which are rare.\n\n   The rings, made of a polymer used for decades in cataract\nsurgery, are inserted about 1/3 of an inch from the center of the\neye through two small incisions.\n\n   ``The best selling point seems to be the fact that they are\nremovable, there's a second chance and all your marbles aren't in\none basket,'' said Dr. Richard L. Abbott, codirector of corneal and\nrefractive surgery at the University of California at San Francisco\nMedical Center, who was a principal investigator in Intacs trials\nat 11 teaching hospitals.\n\n   However, Abbott said that he sees the rings as only ``a niche\nproduct. The idea is that this technology would be expanded'' for\nuse on more myopics as well as people with hyperopia\n(farsightedness) and astigmatism.
