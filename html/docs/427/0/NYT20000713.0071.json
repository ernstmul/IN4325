HOTTON  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Q. We're moving into a steel-beamed condo soon. The windows are\ndouble pane and rated highly for wind resistance. My concern is\nabout UV rays from the sun, fading carpet, and furniture. I have\nheard of a film that can be applied to block the rays. Are such\nfilms effective, and how well do they hold up under washing?\n\n   RUBY ANN PRITCHETT, Virginia Beach, Va.\n\n   A. If your double-paned windows have Low E glass, they are\nalready UV resistant, and nothing more need be done. Low E glass\nincreases the window's insulating value and tends to reflect heat\nand cold, and it helps filter out UV rays. To find out, check with\nthe manufacturer of the windows or the contractor.\n\n   If the windows do not have Low E Glass, you can have them tinted\nor coated. Find a company that does this in the Yellow Pages under\n``glass coating and tinting.'' Properly done, these coatings should\nlast through many washings. They are professionally installed.\n\n    \n\n   Q. We are renovating a 20-year-old, U-shaped ranch and would\nlike to add ridge vents when we redo the roof. We have four gable\nvents now, with an attic fan in one of the vents, and soffit vents\nall around. Do we keep the gable vents when we add ridge vents?\nAlso, the soffit vents, which are 12-inch rectangles every 6 to 8\nfeet, are rusted and bad looking, and my husband wants to replace\nthem with continuous vent strips. Would this work?\n\n   MADELINE and AlAN ARON, Charlotte, N.C.\n\n   A. What you suggest doing is the best thing you can do for your\nattic ventilation and for the house. The ridge vent on all ridges\nis state of the art, and the continuous 2-inch-wide vent strips in\nthe soffits will complete the ventilating scheme. Those rectangular\nsoffit vents are OK except for the rusting, but are way too far\napart to be effective.\n\n   It is generally recommended that when ridge and soffit vents are\ninstalled, the gable vents should be closed, because open, they\nwill interfere with the efficiency of the ridge and soffit vents. I\nagree.\n\n   You can get rid of the attic fan, unless it is used as a whole\nhouse fan, drawing air from outdoors into the first floor and out\nthe attic vent. If it is a whole house fan, you can leave it in\nplace and use it as needed.\n\n    \n\n   Q. We are considering changing our screened-in porch to a\nsunroom, with good windows and screens, but we are afraid we would\nbe creating a hothouse. We don't want to get into heating and air\nconditioning. What considerations should be keep in mind?\n\n   MARY SONNER, Zionsville, Ind.\n\n   A. Your idea of converting the porch into a sunroom is a good\none, particularly if it's on the sunny side of the house. The idea\nof a sunroom is to bring sun and heat into the room and into the\nhouse in winter.\n\n   In summer, shading and ventilation are important to keep the\nroom from getting superheated. Also, keeping it separate from the\nhouse, that is, closing it off with an insulated door in summer, is\nequally important.\n\n   Venting can be done by keeping the windows open for\ncross-ventilation, and shading the windows as well. Because heat\nrises, it might be a good idea to put in some louvered vents above\nthe windows. These, of course, should be closed in winter, but in\nsummer will allow any heated air to escape more readily than\nthrough lower windows.\n\n   Shading can be done with window quilts, if you can get them in\nthe Midwest, sold in specialty home shops. These are most\nexpensive, but room-darkening shades will be helpful. Outside\nawnings also will do a lot toward shading the sunroom.\n\n    \n\n   Q. My son bought a 1930s Tudor-style house in Beverly. Roll\nroofing was used to make the siding look like stucco. It is dirty\nand weathered, and he'd liked to paint it, but the painters said\nasphalt cannot be painted. Is that so? If so, what can he do?\n\n   FRANK SHEA, Marblehead, Mass.\n\n   A. It ain't necessarily so. There are paints designed to cover\nasphalt, but if you cannot find such a paint, consider painting the\nsiding with Reroof, a special, rubberized coating normally for\napshalt roof shingles. It's made by Masters Choice of Jamestown,\nN.Y., 800-766-7622.\n\n    \n\n   Q. Have you ever heard of vinyl shingles, instead of the\nstandard vinyl siding (horizontal clapboards)? Are they any good,\nor better than the siding?\n\n   BRIAN McMAHON, Dorchester, Mass.\n\n   A. Yes, we have heard of them, and have seen them at home shows.\nThey are different from the standard siding, but they are still\nvinyl and, in my opinion, not worth putting on your house. If you\ncan't opt for wood, consider fiber-cement siding that comes in\nclapboards and shingles. While it is an artificial siding, I think\nfiber-cement is the best of the non-wood siding. Call 888-542-7343.\n\n     \n(Globe Handyman on Call Peter Hotton will answer reader questions.\nWrite him at the Boston Globe, Boston, Mass., 02107, or e-mail him\nat hotton(at)globe.com)\n","Headline":"\nDO SUNBLOCK FILMS FOR WINDOWS REALLY WORK? \n","Text":["\n   Q.
