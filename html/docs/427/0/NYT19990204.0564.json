Financial flexibility was a theme for the season. They had\nabout $15 million to spend.\n\n   But then the owners locked out the players. For the Suns, there\nwas double meaning in the term lockout. They were the optimistic\nshopper with a fistful of cash, who suddenly couldn't get into the\nstore.\n\n   A summer plan for negotiations and news conferences turned into\na long, anxious stretch full of wondering and hoping. They\nsucceeded with Plan B, the alternate hustle to sign Gugliotta after\nthe loss of McDyess.\n\n   But their real hope, Plan A, was to sign both. Widespread and\nwell-founded speculation about Scottie Pippen changed when he\nunderwent back surgery after last season's final championship run\nwith the Chicago Bulls.\n\n   Pippen's age, 33, and history of injury played heavily in the\nSuns' decision not to make a run at him. Instead, he went to\nHouston as the Suns waited in vain on McDyess before making a\nconcerted move on Gugliotta, who had supplanted Pippen as their\nprime target.\n\n   With the acquisition of 7-foot-2 center Luc Longley in a deal\nwith Chicago, the Suns' hope was for a front line of McDyess and\nGugliotta to flank the big man. It was intriguing and potentially\nimposing. But it didn't happen.\n\n   ``We're refocusing on a different team than I had expected,''\nSuns Coach Danny Ainge said. ``There was a time a couple of months\nago when we expected a different level of talent. Then there was\ntime a couple of weeks ago when I wasn't expecting anything at all.\nBut now, I'm optimistic.''\n\n   Fact is, McDyess might have slipped from the Suns' grasp,\nanyway. As it turns out, he was at least thinking about a return to\nDenver even before the owners locked their doors to the players.\n\n   There are questions about the Suns' timing and decision not to\nlock McDyess into a long-term deal before the work stoppage.\n\n   But Colangelo said he was confident at midseason last year that\na new deal could be reached with McDyess' agent at the time, Arn\nTellem. McDyess then fired Tellem and hired Tony Dutt last summer,\na lockout period during which NBA management was prohibited from\ntalking to free agents.\n\n   ``I had a hunch then that he wasn't coming back,'' Colangelo\nsaid.\n\n   But by then, the process was under way. General Bryan Colangelo\nwent to work under the revised salary cup rules and put together a\nLongely deal that was critical. It allowed the Suns more money to\noffer Gugliotta in the first season of his six-year, $58.5 million\ncontract. Instead of offering less than $6 million in the first\nyear, the Suns were able to offer Gugliotta $7.8 million because of\nsalary cap space cleared in the Longley acquisition.\n\n   They also were able to keep $3.5 million for a one-year contract\nfor Clifford Robinson and then a six-year, $22.1 million deal for\nRex Chapman.\n\n   Chapman was a given in any Suns plan. He had announced that he\nwould return for the league average salary.\n\n   Robinson became a key part of the plan as signs of McDyess'\ndeparture began to mount. All the while, the Suns were adding other\npieces along the way. Backup center Joe Kleine signed. George\nMcCloud re-enlisted for a second season. Rookies Pat Garrity, Toby\nBailey and Gerald Brown got standard contracts.
