In the United\nStates, about 1 million cases are diagnosed annually.\n\n   The most serious form, melanoma, accounts for about 44,200 cases\neach year. Although skin cancer can be treated if detected early,\nit kills about 9,200 Americans each year.\n\n   The Houston cancer center team, led by Drs. Laurie Hill and\nLaurie Owen-Schaub, identified the role of a particular gene\nproduct, a protein known as FasL, that plays a key role in\nresponding to sunburn and leading to the ``cell suicide.''\n\n   The mouse is considered a good model for human skin cancer\nstudies.\n\n   One potential implication of the study could be that humans\ndefective in the FasL protein may be at greater risk for developing\nskin cancer.\n\n   Owen-Schaub said it appears FasL helps protect the body from\nover-exposure to the sun.\n\n   ``You get DNA damage almost every time you go out,'' she said.\n``If you can get rid of the cells containing the DNA damage, you\nget rid of the cancer.''\n\n   One of the most important known players in ridding the body of\nmutated cells is a gene known as p53, which so far appears to be\nimplicated in half of all cancers.\n\n   When p53 fails to do its job, cancer can occur.\n\n   ``People need to know about p53 and how to protect their p53s,''\nsaid Christopher Kemp, a cancer biologist at the Fred Hutchinson\nCancer Research Center in Seattle.\n\n   Avoiding sun exposure, tobacco and charred meat are ways people\ncan protect their p53 genes, Kemp said.\n\n   The University of Texas study is interesting, he said, because\nthe research team found that FasL appears to work together with p53\nin ridding the skin of pre-cancerous cells.\n\n   ``It sheds light, no pun intended, on the mechanism of how cells\nget damaged by a toxic substance such as sunlight and respond to\nthat damage,'' said the UW's Berg.\n\n   This could lead to tests that might help identify those people\nat higher risk for skin cancer, Berg said. It could also lead to\nbetter treatment and prevention.\n\n   Thursday, doctors said they were concerned the study would be\nmisinterpreted. That fear, they said, stems from the public's\nmisunderstanding of the value of sunscreen lotions.\n\n   Although Owen-Schaub and Berg agreed that the proper use of\nsunscreens likely protects against skin cancer, they said no one\nknows for sure.\n\n   That unanswered question, Berg said, is complicated by a number\nof studies that found people who frequently use sunscreen have a\nhigher rate of skin cancer.\n\n   Some have interpreted this to mean that sunscreens somehow cause\nthe cancer, he said, when it may mean that people who use lotions\nspend more time in the sun.\n\n   ``They get a false sense of security ... and they over-expose\nthemselves,'' said Ananthaswamy.\n\n   He and the other cancer experts said the use of sunscreen\ntogether with limited exposure to sunlight is still the most\nprudent method for preventing the risk of skin cancer.\n\n   The University of Texas study was based on a comparison of mice\nwhich had normal protein FasL activity against mice that were bred\nto be deficient in this protein.\n\n   Both groups of mice were then exposed to UV radiation.\n\n   Among the normal mice, 5 percent had genetically damaged, or\nmutated, skin cells.\n\n   Among the FasL-deficient mice, 70 percent had mutated cells.\n\n   That indicates that the lack of FasL allowed more DNA damaged\ncells to persist.\n","Headline":"\nDOCTORS WORRY THAT STUDY ON SUNBURN, SKIN CANCER WILL BE\nMISINTERPRETED \n","Text":["\n   Scientists in Texas have found that sunburn may actually stop\nthe beginnings of skin cancer by ridding the skin of genetically\ndamaged cells.\n","\n   But the researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in\nHouston cautioned sun lovers that the finding is not at all an\nendorsement of serious tanning.\n","\n   ``This doesn't mean a sunburn is a good thing,'' said Dr.\nHonnavara Ananthaswamy, chairman of immunology at the University of\nTexas' M.D. Anderson center and a co-author of the study, published\nFriday in the journal, Science.\n","\n   Reacting to the study's findings, Dr. Daniel Berg, director of\ndermatologic surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle,\nsaid it's the sunburn that causes the damage in the first place.\n","\n   ``Believing sunburns will protect you against skin cancer is\nlike arguing that slashing somebody with a knife stimulates their\nbody's wound healing system.''\n","\n   The Texas team's research, based on mice, showed that skin\nburned by excessive exposure to the ultraviolet portion of sunlight\ntriggers a genetically programmed ``cell suicide'' mechanism that\nkills off heavily irradiated skin cells.\n","\n   But Ananthaswamy emphasized that the same sunburn also causes\nmoderate damage in cells that don't get eliminated.\n","\n   ``You might kill off those cells with excessive damage, but\ncells with less damage will persist, and may later develop into\ncancer,'' he said. ``This (study) isn't a license to go out and get\na sunburn.''\n","\n   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer.
