Later came contact lenses and the almost daily\nirritation caused by chronically dry eyes.\n\n   That all changed for the Keller High School honor student one\nmorning this month at a posh Arlington, Texas, clinic called TLC\n(The Laser Center). With the rat-tat-tat of a laser machine,\nmicroscopic amounts of tissue were removed from the cornea of each\neye. When the $4,600 procedure called LASIK surgery was finished\nafter only 15 minutes, McCormick could immediately read a wall\nclock without glasses or contacts, for her an almost unprecedented\nfeat.\n\n   ``Oh my gosh,'' McCormick said a few days after the surgery that\ncorrected her acute nearsightedness to virtually perfect vision.\n``Just today I got out of the shower and went to get my glasses,\nthen I thought, `Wait a minute. I don't need glasses anymore.' I\ntell people that it seems almost like magic. It's just incredible\nin that short of time you can have that much improvement.''\n\n   Such happy incredulity is increasingly familiar in a country\nwhere the number of LASIK patients has roughly doubled every year\nfor the past four. This year an estimated 1 million people will\nundergo the surgery. They are people who now play tennis, jog,\nwater ski, see the morning alarm clock, or shave their legs in the\nshower without glasses or contacts, many for the first time.\nCelebrities, from Tiger Woods to Troy Aikman, have cashed in on the\nLASIK craze, too.\n\n   So why then the spate of recent articles, which, while not\nexactly raining on the LASIK parade, have struck decidedly\ncautionary notes? It seems that somewhere in the growing\ncelebration, the stories say, an important message has been lost:\nWith LASIK, as in any surgery, there are risks, relatively minimal\n(less than a 5 percent risk of complications for experienced\nsurgeons using the best equipment), but risks nonetheless.\n\n   And some insist that the whole thing is moving too fast.\nInexperienced doctors eager to cash in, critics say, can be too\nprone to operate on high-risk patients, who themselves are too\neager to gain the seemingly miraculous benefits. Thousands can\ntestify to the irksome and occasionally disabling consequences.\n\n   Kirk Carver, an electrical engineer in Beaumont in East Texas,\nsaid no one at a bustling Houston eye clinic warned him that his\ndegree of astigmatism made him a poor candidate for the procedure.\n(The clinic did not return a recent telephone call inquiring about\nCarver's case.) After two LASIK surgeries, in September and\nDecember of last year, Carver's sight is much worse than it was\nbefore. His career has been disrupted. He can no longer drive at\nnight. His condition, which pitched him into a severe depression\nfor weeks, is not correctable with available technology.\n\n   Through an Internet site devoted to the risks of LASIK\n(www.surgicaleyes.org), Carver has encountered scores of people,\nmany of them with LASIK outcomes even worse than his own.\n\n   ``I don't want people to think we're down on the surgery\nitself,'' Carver said. ``For the right person with the right doctor\nand right equipment, it's very good surgery. But the problem is\nthat the industry has gotten ahead of itself, and there are\ncasualties being created because of it.''\n\n   _\n\n   For almost a half-century, specialists around the world have\ntargeted the cornea, the eye's curved, transparent outer layer, in\ntheir attempts to find surgical remedies for the most common visual\nmaladies. The reason is that much of the eye's refraction, or\nbending of light to form an image inside the eye, takes place\nthrough the cornea. A cornea too steeply curved commonly produces\nnearsightedness, one too flat, farsightedness.\n\n   As far back as the 1960s, specialists in Japan and the Soviet\nUnion reshaped corneas with a series of incisions, a procedure\nknown as radial keratotomy, or RK. But the surgery was painful,\ngenerally took months to heal and was prone to complications, and\nthe cornea often failed to retain its new shape. Largely as a\nresult, RK never really took hold in the United States.\n\n   Enter the excimer laser, which was first developed in the 1970s\nas a tool to etch computer microchips. The laser's precision was\nsuch that it could cut notches in a strand of hair without severing\nit. And the excimer was a cool laser, meaning it would not burn\ntissue if applied to surgical use.\n\n   Dr. Stephen Trokel, a Columbia University ophthalmologist, was\namong the first to realize that potential application. In the early\n1980s, in a visit to a computer lab, Trokel experimented with the\nexcimer on the eye of a calf. A few years later at Louisiana State\nUniversity, the laser was tested on the eyes of humans whose\nblindness was believed to be irreversible, said Irving Arons, a\nMassachusetts-based consultant to the medical laser industry. One\nof those patients had her vision restored, Arons said.\n\n   The excimer emergence first spawned a procedure known as PRK\n(photorefractive keratectomy) in which the cornea's outer layer was\ngently scraped away with a scalpel and the laser then used to\nreshape the tissue beneath. When the outer layer grew back, the\ncornea retained its corrected shape.\n\n   Although an improvement over RK, healing from PRK could still be\nslow and painful. That changed with LASIK, (laser-assisted in situ\nkeratomileusis), in which pain generally abates in a few hours and\npatients can gain visual benefits almost immediately.\n\n   MORE nn\n\n   The real advance of LASIK is not in the laser itself, but in the\nmethod of exposing the inner layer of the cornea for reshaping.\nUsing a device called a microkeratome, surgeons delicately peel\nback a layer of the cornea about the thickness of a grape skin,\nleaving one end of the layer attached to create a corneal flap.\n\n   In Karen McCormick's recent surgery at TLC, located at The\nBallpark in Arlington, the patient's nervous parents watched on a\ntelevision monitor as the microkeratome slid across her eye,\ncreating a flap that her eye surgeon, Dr. Robert Gillett, gently\nfolded out of the way. When the computer-controlled laser treatment\nwas finished, Gillett teased the flap back into place on the\ncornea, patting it down with several strokes of a small brush. The\nburning sensation in McCormick's eyes abated in a few hours.\n\n   In many ways, creating the flap is the most delicate and risky\nportion of the procedure, and not until the mid-1990s, when\nmicrokeratome technology had advanced enough to make it safe, did\nLASIK begin to find an audience among eye specialists and their\npatients. But once it did, because of the quick healing and almost\ninstantaneous results, LASIK became a snowball rolling downhill, a\nphenomenon that grew, at least in the early stages, by word of\nmouth.\n\n   Even today, as LASIK advertising accelerates, the experience of\nfriends, relatives and co-workers often is the most powerful\nendorsement. Carolyn Ender listened for months as colleagues at a\nLas Colinas investment firm spoke of their LASIK miracles. At the\nsame time, Ender's husband, Brad, had grown weary of putting in\ncontact lenses for his early morning jogs, inspiring the couple to\nundergo LASIK one after another, a few hours after McCormick's\nsurgery at TLC.\n\n   Then they had ``miracle'' stories of their own.\n\n   ``We had our procedure at 2, and at 8 that night my wife and I\nare both sitting there watching a movie without glasses,'' Brad\nEnder said. ``It's like you have a brand-new pair of contacts in,\nbut it's better than that.''\n\n   _\n\n   But there are other LASIK stories, those of annoyance, even\nheartbreak, that until recently have remained in the shadows. Just\nin the last few months, those tales have begun popping up in the\nAmerican media, from The New York Times to Forbes to an Oct. 11\ncover story in Time. The Time article did not ignore the successes,\nquoting the typically gleeful patients after procedures that went\nas planned.\n\n   But Time also pointed out, as would good doctors, that people\nrequiring a high degree of correction in glasses or contact lenses,\nor those with unusually large pupils, may not make good candidates\nfor LASIK. The story detailed the glare, starbursts and halos\naround lights that sometimes afflict LASIK patients, generally at\nnight.\n\n   Quoting industry studies, Time said that an estimated 10 to 15\npercent of LASIK patients must undergo a second surgery to get\ntheir correction right. Time's LASIK package also included the\npersonal story of a magazine staffer, who, after her own\nunsuccessful surgery, wondered whether she would ever see her\nchildren in clear focus again.\n\n   Letters from around the country poured in.\n\n   ``People responded to the fact that there was any downside\nmentioned at all,'' said Christine Gorman, who wrote the Time\narticle, ``that this was elective surgery on your eyes, and not\nsomething you should jump into. ... We got all kinds of letters\nfrom people with problems who said things like `I thought I was the\nonly one.' ''\n\n   Doctors also responded, Gorman said.\n\n   ``We had a really nice array of letters, including those from\nophthalmologists who do the surgery, thanking us for piercing the\nhype, so to speak,'' she said. ``Interestingly enough, some of the\nmore commercial doctors were not too happy.''\n\n   The message from such articles, one that would not be disputed\nby reputable physicians, is thus: Prospective patients, as eager as\nthey may be to discard glasses and contacts, need to take a deep\nbreath and do their homework. It is their only set of eyes, after\nall.\n\n   A Fort Worth woman says she was sobered by her recent LASIK\nsurgery in which her corneas were apparently overcorrected. It\nbecame dangerous for her to drive at night because of the myriad\ncircles that surrounded each lamp and headlight. She has been\nassured by her doctor that the problem can be corrected with a\nsecond surgery. But her case illustrates the fact that problems do\noccur.\n\n   ``Be sure to get a lot of information about what they're doing\nand what options there might be,'' the woman said of her advice to\npotential LASIK patients. ``But also they should ask themselves\njust how uncomfortable they are with contacts. It is a big deal. I\nthink they are doing so many and you see so much coverage on TV\nthat some people think it's like going to get a hamburger at\nMcDonald's. And it's a serious matter.''\n\n   So where does the LASIK truth lie?\n\n   ``This is surgery. It's not perfect. There will be\ncomplications,'' said Dr. Stephen Slade, a Houston surgeon who has\npioneered LASIK surgery in the United States. ``The good news is\nthe complication rate is very low.''\n\n   So low, Slade says, that eye doctors are undergoing LASIK\nsurgery in much larger percentages than the general public. And\nrisk, Slade says, can be minimized by patients who recognize the\nsurgery's seriousness and act accordingly.\n\n   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for a patient,'' he said.\n``The patient needs to look around, talk to different doctors and\ndifferent patients, read something. The best combination is an\nexperienced surgeon and an experienced patient.''\n\n   _\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com)\nnn\n","Headline":"\nIS RUSH TO LASER SURGERY SHOTSIGHTED?\n","Text":["\n   From her first losing encounter with an eye chart as a\nkindergartner, glasses were Karen McCormick's constant childhood\ncompanion.
