Times News Service    \n\n   Sharon McCormack of White Salmon, Wash., loved windsurfing the\nColumbia River Gorge, but she had a problem on the big jumps: Her\ncontact lenses washed out. ``Or I got dust under a lens,'' she\nsaid. ``That's incredibly painful.''\n\n   Ms. McCormack solved the problem by having laser surgery to\ncorrect her nearsightedness. More than 400,000 laser vision\nprocedures will be done this year, industry sources say, most of\nthem for nearsightedness, or myopia, like Ms. McCormack's. But next\nyear, farsighted surfers and others may be having laser surgery,\ntoo.\n\n   In July, the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Food and Drug\nAdministration recommended approval of a laser to treat\nfarsightedness, or hyperopia.\n\n   Final approval by the agency is expected by year's end.\n\n   ``I'm sure that Americans will be treated for farsightedness\nwith lasers next year,'' said Dr. Scott MacRae, associate professor\nof ophthalmology at the Casey Eye Institute at the Oregon Health\nSciences University in Portland. MacRae has also served on the FDA\nOphthalmic Devices Panel.\n\n   Now, two lasers used to treat myopia and myopia with astigmatism\nare approved by the federal agency. The basic procedures,\nphotorefractive keratotomy (PRK) and laser in-situ keratomileusis\n(Lasik), remove tiny bits of the cornea to flatten it so light\nfocuses more precisely on the retina. PRK shapes the cornea's\nsurface; Lasik, a mid-corneal method, vaporizes or ablates the\nmiddle of the cornea rather than the front to improve focus.\n\n   Farsightedness, however, is more difficult to correct, MacRae\nsaid. In the new procedure, a laser will be used to sculpture the\narea in the periphery of the cornea, in effect, making the center\nsteeper and bringing the focus from behind the retina to the\nretina.\n\n   ``What you're doing for the nearsighted is a crewcut to the\ncornea,'' MacRae said. ``For the farsighted, you have the trickier\njob of steepening the cornea.''\n\n   A variation of farsightedness that the new procedures will not\ntreat is presbyopia, the gradual, age-related condition of suddenly\nfuzzy print and the necessity of reading glasses. ``About the time\nyou turn 40, the eyes start to lose their capability to focus\nsharply for near vision,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Weaver, director of the\nClinical Care Center at the American Optometric Association in St.\nLouis. ``These new laser procedures won't affect presbyopia,\nbecause the condition is not due to the cornea. It comes about as\nthe lens loses its ability to accommodate or focus sharply for near\nvision, a loss of elasticity that is inevitable as we age.''\n\n   The new laser methods to treat farsightedness are expected to\ncost at least $4,000 and probably will not be covered by most\ninsurance policies.\n\n   Weaver cautions that any laser treatment should be approached\nthoughtfully. ``PRK and Lasik for myopia have been very\nsuccessful,'' he said. ``People are usually quite happy with the\noutcomes, unlike older surgeries like radial keratotomy.''\n\n   No matter how successful a procedure, though, risks remain.\n``Surgeons doing Lasik actually slice off the front surface of the\neye, flip it back, do the laser procedure, and then return the flap\nto its place,'' Weaver said. ``There's always the small possibility\nthat the flap may become dislodged. You have to weigh the risk\nagainst how much you want to get rid of your glasses or contact\nlenses.''\n","Headline":"\nLASERS MAY SOON BE USED TO THREAT FARSIGHTEDNESS \n","Text":["\n   Sharon McCormack of White Salmon, Wash., loved windsurfing the\nColumbia River Gorge, but she had a problem on the big jumps: Her\ncontact lenses washed out. ``Or I got dust under a lens,'' she\nsaid. ``That's incredibly painful.''\n","\n   Ms. McCormack solved the problem by having laser surgery to\ncorrect her nearsightedness.
