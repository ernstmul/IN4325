Chances are it's your buttocks, and the reasons are\nclear.\n\n   ``Eighty to 90 percent of the damage you normally associate with\naging is sun damage,'' said Dr. Mark Mitchnick, a Long Island\npediatrician and medical director of SunSmart Inc., a private\nresearch and development company specializing in sunscreens.\n\n   These days, most people are trying to protect themselves with\nsunscreens. But knowing how to decode the numbers can be confusing,\nand not all sunscreens are alike.\n\n   Many products say they offer a sun protection factor or SPF of\n15, 30 or 45 times ``your natural sunburn protection.'' Others\npromise all day protection that's waterproof or water-resistant.\n\n   Calling such claims misleading and confusing, the Food and Drug\nAdministration recently has issued new labeling guidelines to make\nit easier for consumers to know what they're buying. The rules are\nthe first to cover the testing and labeling of sunscreens since the\nFDA issued tentative standards in 1978 and 1993.\n\n   As of May 2001, words such as ``waterproof'' ``sunblock'' and\n``all-day protection'' will be banished because such claims ``could\nprovide the wrong message and a false sense of security,'' the FDA\nsays.\n\n   Also disappearing from the shelf will be any products labeled\nwith an SPF higher than 30, in favor of one label: ``30 Plus.'' As\nthe FDA explains it, the benefits of products above 30 are tiny and\ndifficult to accurately measure.\n\n   Dr. Mitchell Singer, a Schenectady dermatologist, agrees. ``It's\nbecome a numbers game,'' he said. ``You don't really get anywhere\nonce you get to a certain point.''\n\n   So how high should you go with sunscreen? To answer that\nquestion, you need to know how sunscreens are designed to work.\n\n   A sunscreen with an SPF 15, for example, theoretically means\nthat someone who would burn in 15 minutes could stay burn-free for\n3 hours and 45 minutes. Using an SPF 30 would lengthen the\nprotected period to 7.5 hours.\n\n   But those laboratory calculations don't take into account\nreal-world conditions, such as sweating, swimming or skimping on\nthe amount of sunscreen used. You should also know that the higher\nSPFs provide only slightly more protection.\n\n   For example, SPF 30 filters nearly 97 percent of sunburning\nrays, while SPF 45 filters only about 1 percent more.\n\n   Because there's not a lot of difference in the higher SPFs,\nSinger spends less time talking numbers with his patients than\ntrying to get them to use sunscreen daily, not just for the long\nday on the boat or at the beach. ``If you use it on a daily basis\nall else is equal,'' said Singer, who recommends an SPF 15.\n\n   Mitchnick believes applying sunscreen should be as routine as\nbrushing your teeth, since every moment in the sun can add up to\nproblems later. ``Most of the sun you get in your life is daily, in\nsmall incremental doses,'' he said.\n\n   On a daily basis, Michelle DiPasquale, 24, gets more than her\nfair share of sun as a summer lifeguard for the New York Department\nof Parks and Recreation, which issues sunblock with the uniform.\n\n   ``As I get older, I'm worried about it on my face,'' DiPasquale\nsaid. ``It does cause premature aging of the skin. You can tell.''\n\n   Some easy ways to protect yourself include wearing a hat, and\nusing sunscreen with at least an SPF 15 daily.\n\n   Mitchnick also counsels people to look for a sunscreen that\nprotects against both UVA and UVB rays. Not all sunscreens protect\nagainst UVA, and you should read the fine print on the label to\nfind out.\n\n   Finally, Mitchnick is a big proponent of zinc oxide. But since\nmost people don't want to spread the white paste all over their\nbodies, his company patented a transparent formula in the early\n1990s.\n\n   Two years ago, many of the large cosmetic and sunscreen\ncompanies, including Oil of Olay, Maybelline, Body Shop, Nu Skin,\nIguana and Basis, started using Z-Cote on a regular basis.\n\n   ``They work wonderfully,'' Singer said. ``It's like wearing long\npants and going outside.''\n\n   Remember, however, that no product offers total protection\nagainst the sun, and you shouldn't use sunscreen as an excuse to\nstay out longer.\n\n   ``It's a matter of using common sense,'' Singer said. ``Just\nbecause you're wearing a seatbelt doesn't mean you should drive 100\nmph.''\n\n       \n\n   (Sylvia Wood can be reached at 518-454-5445 or by electronic\nmail at swood(at)timesunion.com)\n","Headline":"\nFOUNTAIN OF YOUTH MAY BE FOUND IN THE SHADE \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Think of the part of your body with the\nsmoothest, softest, baby-like skin.\n","\n   If you're an adult, it's probably not your face, your arms or\nyour belly.
