About eight years\nago, his brother Larry, now 60, found out he had melanoma, the most\nfatal form of skin cancer. He contacted his other siblings and\nfound out that Frank, too, got the diagnosis. And Harry. And Gus.\nFortunately, all were caught in time and the brothers have lived to\ntell the tale.\n\n   ``My doctor thought we should have done ourselves a favor and\ngrown up in Alaska,'' said Robert Flynn, who has fair skin and blue\neyes.\n\n   Flynn's doctor believes he didn't get the disease because of his\nreligious use of sunscreen. But 30 years ago, there was less of an\nawareness by the general public that there was such a strong\nconnection between sunlight exposure and melanoma.\n\n   ``When we were young, mother just gave us 11 kids tomato\nsandwiches and sent us to the beach. No protection,'' Flynn said.\n\n   Half of all cancers diagnosed in the US this year will be skin\ncancer, making it the most common cancer diagnosis.\n\n   The incidence of melanoma, the least common but most deadly form\nof skin cancer, has doubled among Caucasians in the past 20 years,\nprobably due to a combination of factors including depletion of the\nearth's ozone layer _ which filters out the sun's most damaging\nultraviolet wavelengths _ and greater time spent outdoors on\nbeaches, golf courses, hiking trails, and the like.\n\n   While adults may suit up for the sun with a hat, sunglasses, and\nlong pants, children and teenagers usually have better things to do\nthan conjure up ways to avoid the sun.\n\n   But studies indicate that intense, early exposure to sunlight\nmay trigger many cases of skin cancer. Indeed, just a few severe\nsunburns during childhood may be all it takes to set the stage for\nmelanoma.\n\n   Although whites get melanoma at far greater rates than blacks,\nAsians, and Hispanics _ mainly because their skin has less\nprotective pigment _ no racial group is immune from the disease.\n\n   Last month a federal ``cancer report card'' noted that the\nnumber of new cancer cases declined significantly for most cancers\nbetween 1990 and 1996 _ except for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and\nmelanoma. The incidence of melanoma rose almost three percent a\nyear during the six-year period.\n\n   An estimated 44,200 new cases of melanoma are expected to be\ndiagnosed in the US this year, a six percent increase over last\nyear.\n\n   Yet, melanoma is one of the most preventable _ and if detected\nearly _ curable of the deadly cancers.\n\n   Because about 80 percent of a person's lifetime exposure to the\nsun was accumulated before he or she turned 18, it's important to\nput sunscreen on young children and drive home the point to\nteenagers, said Kenneth Arndt, chief of dermatology at Beth Israel\nDeaconess Hospital in Boston.\n\n   Adults who had even one severe sunburn during childhood increase\ntheir risk of developing melanoma by 40 percent, said Margaret\nTucker, chief of the genetic epidemiology branch at the National\nCancer Institute.\n\n   Dr. Gary Peck, director of the Melanoma Center at the Washington\nHospital Center in Washington, D.C., said he had a patient with\nmelanoma who could only recall one blistering sunburn during her\nchildhood. It was on the top of her foot, near the toes.\n\n   ``It was the exact spot where she got her melanoma,'' said Peck,\nwho added that he recently diagnosed a 12-, 13-, and 15-year-old\nwith melanoma.\n\n   So it's critical for people to check their skin for\nunusual-looking moles or moles that have changed in shape or color\nand to get an annual skin check by a primary care doctor or\ndermatologist, doctors say.\n\n   New York dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler said that she sees\nmore cases of melanoma than she did 10 years ago and in\nprogressively younger patients. In the early 1980s, for example,\nmost of the melanoma cases she saw were in adults in their 50s to\n70s. In the last four years, she has seen patients in their 20s to\n40s.\n\n   When a new patient comes in to see Wexler about facial wrinkles\nor acne, she requires each one to go through a full-body skin\ncheck.\n\n   ``They have to completely undress, including underwear. Even\nthough they frequently say `I've had a checkup or I have a doctor,'\n'' said Wexler. ``If I take care of their skin, I have to know if\nthey have any skin cancers. That's the first order of priority.''\n\n   Although melanoma is the most feared form of skin cancer, it is\nthe least common. Basal and squamous cell carcinomas are the most\nfrequent type _ they account for about 95 percent of all skin\ncancers _ and they are easy to remove. Basal cell carcinoma is\nrarely fatal, but if the squamous cell type is left untreated, it\ncan spread and be deadly.\n\n   Robert Flynn had two cases of basal-cell carcinoma, which occurs\nmost frequently on the face, ears, and arms.\n\n   ``My doctor said that the only reason I got basal instead (of\nmelanoma) was because I started using sunscreen as soon as it came\nout on the market,'' said Flynn, who added that he ``positively\nloves the sun'' and still goes to the beach every day.\n\n     \n(SIDEBAR)   \nSKIN CHECKS NOT USUALLY PART OF PHYSICAL   \n  \n\n   Patricia Gross wished her husband's primary care doctor had been\na little more forceful about having him go to a dermatologist.\n\n   In February 1996, the physician noticed a spot on her husband\nLouis' left shoulder and simply told him, `you should get it looked\nat,' Patricia recalls. Louis never did. Five months later, Patricia\nnoticed the mole and suggested that her husband see a\ndermatologist.\n\n   It turned out to be melanoma.\n\n   Surprising as it may seem, checking the skin for melanoma is not\na standard part of the routine physical exam, said Dr. Julie R.\nLange, assistant professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Medical\nInstitutions. She and her collegues conducted a study, published in\nFebruary in the Journal of the American Medical Association, that\nindicated that physicians were four times more likely than patients\nto detect early melanomas. The melanomas doctors caught were also\nsubstantially thinner than patient-detected tumors, meaning they\nwere found at an earlier stage.\n\n   Lange recommends that everyone take the initative and ask their\nprimary care physician to look at their skin during regular\nphysical exams.\n\n   However, fair-skinned, blue-eyed people of northern European\nancestry and those who have a lot of freckles and moles are most at\nrisk for melanoma and should talk to their doctor about whether\nit's necessary for them to see a dermatologist for a yearly exam,\ndoctors say.\n\n   It's important to keep in mind, however, that anyone, of any\nrace, can get melanoma, Lange said.\n\n   ``You can't assume just because you are not Caucasian,'' Lange\nsaid.\n\n   Reggae musician Bob Marley died of melanoma at age 36.\n\n   And those with a family history of melanoma are also at risk,\neven if they do not spend a lot of time in the sun; researchers are\nnot completely sure why this is but they suspect some people have a\ngenetic predisposition to the disease.\n\n   Once Larry Flynn found out he had a melanoma tumor, his doctor\nasked him to call his 10 siblings. Three brothers have had melanoma\nand only one sister has escaped skin cancer so far.
