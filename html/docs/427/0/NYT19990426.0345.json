I\nwant to take her to the park. I'd like to be able to take her to\nSeaWorld one day.''\n\n   Amanda, who had not been in the sun since she was 11 months old,\nclapped as about 20 family members at NASA's Rocket Park surrounded\nher. The girl, who suffers from numerous neurological problems\nassociated with the skin disorder, will be able to go outside for\nrecess Tuesday for the first time at Barrett Primary School, where\nher mother is a teacher's aide.\n\n   Erica, whose family moved to Houston from Honduras two years\nago, is planning to attend Chambers Elementary School in the Alief\nschool district next month.\n\n   Diagnosed after she came to this country, Erica, unlike Amanda,\ndoes not suffer from any neurological problems and has been taught\nat home by a homebound teacher, Carole Harrel.\n\n   Harrel said Erica was dying when her mother, Tomasa Silva,\nsneaked across the border to bring Erica to Houston for medical\nattention. The girl's father, Regoberto Lemus, stayed behind to\nsell their possessions before joining them.\n\n   The family is now going through steps to become legal U.S.\ncitizens. Erica's father, a 33-year-old air-conditioner repairman,\nran outside with his daughter after she put on her special suit.\n\n   ``She wants to go outside and play with other children,'' he\nsaid, ``and she wants to go to the beach in Galveston.''\n\n   They watched during the ceremony as Erica, their only child, was\nfitted with her light blue cotton and Lycra-blend suit.\n\n   The suits are made of machine-washable fabric that contains a\nchemical that blocks ultraviolet light, said Robert L. Dotts. He is\nassistant director of NASA's Technology Transfer and\nCommercialization Office, which designed the suits.\n\n   The suits will protect the girls from 99.9 percent of UV rays,\nhe said.\n\n   The office worked with Solar Protective Factory in California to\ndevelop the fabric and the Microclimate Systems Inc. in Michigan to\nprovide the cooling systems for the suits, Dotts said.\n\n   The suits, which include pants and a loose-fitting, long-sleeve\ntop, socks and gloves, are worn over regular clothes. Also included\nare a neckband and hooded cap with built-in dark, tinted goggles.\nOver the suits, the girls wore a white cooling vest equipped with\nfour gel packs,\n\n   which last for two to three hours. The vests can be recharged in\na refrigerator in 30 minutes.\n\n   After the girls received the suits during a presentation at\nSpace Center Houston, they put them on and boarded a tram for a\nshort visit to Rocket Park.\n\n   Though neither spoke _ Erica is shy and Amanda is unable to talk\n_ their enjoyment was evident.\n\n   To date, 21 children throughout the world who suffer from the\ndisease, as well as from other conditions that prevent them from\ngoing outside, have been fitted with the special outfits, Dotts\nsaid. Thirty others are on a waiting list.\n\n   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration got involved\nin creating the suits after being contact by Hampton, Va.,\nhomemaker Sarah Moody in 1986. She requested help for her nephew\nwho was born without sweat glands. Moody went on to found the HED\n(hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplastia) Foundation. With money donated\nto the foundation, the $2,000 suits are given to ailing children.\n\n   ``These children without NASA would still be confined to their\nhomes,'' Moody said Monday during the ceremonies in which the girls\nreceived their suits. ``It will give them a quality of life they\ncould never have had without NASA. We've opened the door from\ndarkness to sunlight.''\n\n   ``She's really going to get to go outside,'' said Amanda's\nstepmother, Veronica Clanton, 29, of nearby Kenefick in Liberty\nCounty. ``It's kind of scary to think that for the past 9 years\nAmanda has never gotten to go outside and now they're saying this\nsuit is going to enable her to do that.''\n\n   Amanda's mother and her father, John Clanton, 32, a centrifuge\nmechanic, knew something was wrong with their daughter when she was\n5 months old and was not growing at a normal rate. She was\ndiagnosed with the life-threatening disorder at 13 months of age.\n\n   Caused by a genetic disorder, the disease has been identified in\nless than 1,000 cases known worldwide.\n\n   Persons with xeroderma pigmentosum have no pigmentation and no\ndefense against ultraviolet light. The slightest exposure to the\nsun can cause skin cancer. A range of symptoms are associated with\nthose inflicted with the ailment _ including blindness and\ndeafness; blistering or freckling on minimum sun exposure;\ndevelopmental disabilities; dwarfism and hypergonadism; increased\nskin and eye cancers; and mental retardation.\n\n   Since there is no cure, those with the disorder can only curtail\nit by avoiding the UV radiation by staying indoors with sunlight\nblocked out or by using protective clothing, sunscreens and\nsunglasses.\n\n   Amanda, who has 17 different doctors, is non-verbal, 90 percent\nblind and 85 percent deaf.
