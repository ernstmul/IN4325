Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ In the waiting room of Dr. Mark Fromer's office in\nTrump Tower _ not so long ago filled with elderly patients seeking\ntreatment for cataract disease _ young professionals with expensive\nhaircuts whisper into cell phones as they wait for their 15-minute\nlaser eye surgery appointments.\n\n   Patients at the SoHo Integrative Health Center in Manhattan can\nsee Dr. Laurie Polis, the center's dermatologist, for a routine\nskin cancer check, then get the wrinkles in their forehead zapped.\n\n   Dr. Irwin Smigel, a prominent Manhattan dentist, passes people\nneeding routine fillings on to his associates; he is far too busy\napplying the latest tooth-whitening concoction on his patients.\n\n   Until recently, doctors who specialized in so-called lifestyle\nmedicine _ elective and largely cosmetic procedures _ were limited\nto rarefied corners of the medical profession. But facing declining\nrevenues because of reimbursement cuts by managed-care companies,\nthousands of doctors in New York and across the country are turning\nto cosmetic medicine to keep their practices lucrative.\n\n   The reason is simple: Because nearly every elective procedure\nintended to improve the appearance of a patient is not paid for by\ninsurance companies, patients must pay up front, often staggering\nsums. Laser eye surgery, for instance, costs about $5,000. For\ndoctors, that means no rejected bills, no paperwork and no reduced\npayments by managed-care companies.\n\n   In some practices, cosmetic procedures are supplementing basic\ncare; in others, they are nearly replacing it.\n\n   In the last 10 years, fees for many medical procedures dropped\nsignificantly because of third-party payers, said Timothy J.\nMurphy, chief executive of QVS Technology Group, a health care\nconsulting firm in Des Plaines, Ill., that helps doctors set up\nalternatives to their usual business. ``And when doctors lost\nthat,'' he said, ``like any red-blooded American, they thought to\nthemselves, `What am I going to do here?'''\n\n   And with a strong economy, there seems to be no shortage of\ndeep-pocketed consumers who feel their lives will be enhanced by\nhaving fewer wrinkles, perpetually hairless legs and a face free of\ncumbersome eyeglasses. In turn, explosions in technology have made\nmany of these aesthetic procedures more exacting and easier to\npractice.\n\n   Elective procedures make up nearly 25 percent of many medical\npractices like plastic surgery and dermatology in urban areas,\nexperts in the field said, up from 10 percent five years ago.\n\n   The trend is led by laser eye surgery, which in just a few years\nhas transformed ophthalmology; in the last two years alone, the\nnumber of Americans who underwent laser eye surgery to correct\ntheir vision problems increased more than 500 percent, and doctors\nwho do the procedure are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars\nmarketing themselves.\n\n   Doctors in a host of other medical specialties are also joining\naesthetics with medicine: Dermatologists, especially in major\ncities, are prescribing more Botox injections for wrinkles than\nthey are acne medicines, and many are selling anti-aging creams and\nother beauty products in their offices. Dentists are using the\nlatest in super-whitening techniques. And even\nobstetrician-gynecologists are offering laser hair removal to their\npatients.\n\n   The attraction of cosmetic medicine, with its fee-for-service\npayment structure and high demand, may mean that many doctors will\nnow shun more basic but less lucrative procedures like general eye\ncare and reconstructive surgery for accident victims.\n\n   ``What you will find is that the supply of the low-profit\nservices will decline,'' said Dr. David Friend, a health care\nmanagement consultant with Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Boston. ``The\nresult is a tiering effect, where the best doctors are doing the\nprivate stuff and doctors unable to succeed in those things will\nprovide the public service care. We have created an incentive for\neveryone who can to get out of low-margin businesses, and that\ncould have enormous policy implications.''\n\n   Dr. Alan R. Kling, who has a dermatologic and cosmetic surgery\npractice on Park Avenue, said that he is one such doctor. ``There\nare certain cases that I am not doing anymore,'' Kling said, citing\ncomplicated cancer surgeries for which he said insurance companies\nreimburse him only $100, much less than the cost to him.\n\n   Kling, whose hold music on his telephone is a running ad for\nliposuction and skin injections, said that in 1996, things like\nliposuction and Botox accounted for only 5 percent of his business.\nNow, they are closer to 25 percent. ``It used to be when people who\ncame out of school wanted to do cosmetics, they were looked down\non,'' he said. ``At Harvard, they called it `throwing the pearls to\nthe swine.' Now, in terms of survival, it is what you do.''\n\n   Fromer, the ophthalmologist, said that five years ago, the core\nof his business was retina surgery and general ophthalmology. Now,\n90 percent is laser eye surgery. He also points to economics. In\nthe early 1990s, he said, Medicare would pay him $3,000 to $3,500\nfor cataract surgery, but now he receives $750 to $2,000 per case.\n``I would describe laser as the thing that allows me to offer\ngeneral care to my patients,'' Fromer said.\n\n   nn\n\n   As it turns out, deciding to offer procedures that cater to\nvain, stressed- out or just very wealthy patients is not a simple\nmatter of buying new equipment and adding another line to a Yellow\nPages ad. Doctors find that they have to overhaul their entire\npractices, from the way their receptionists answer the phone to the\ncouches patients sit on to the length of time they make them wait\nfor an appointment.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   And they often spend thousands of dollars on advertising: Listen\nto AM radio for an hour and you might think the only things for\nsale in America are laser eye surgery and auto insurance.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   ``The demographics for these procedures is much younger, maybe\n30 to 55 years old,'' said Murphy of QVS Technology Group. ``You\nhave to treat them differently than a 70-year-old patient trying to\nget an appointment because they can't see.''\n\n   ```I'll see if we can fit you in in three weeks' won't work with\nthe McDonald's society who wants it hot, wants in now and wants it\ncheap,'' he said. ``The staff has to give high-class treatment. We\ncompare it to the airline industry: There is a difference between\nthe first-class cabin and the back of the bus.''\n\n   Fromer said that he gave his office one such face lift. The\nfurniture and waiting room are turned out in subtle, tasteful\ntones. The equipment is sleek and spotless, as though it just fell\noff a space ship. Patients recovering from their surgery rest in\nreclining chairs, covered in soft cotton blankets. His office\nemployees look as though they would fit in quite well behind the\ncounter of an upscale gym.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   ``When a patient walks through the door,'' he said, ``they have\nto see that the doctor has done this before, that the equipment is\ntop-notch and the office has to be extremely friendly.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   At the SoHo Integrative Health Center, atmosphere is taken to\nthe highest level. Patients see an array of specialists on one\nfloor, including an obstetrician-gynecologist, ophthalmologist and\ninternist, and can get their facials, massages, nutritional therapy\nand Eastern medicine by climbing a winding staircase, past the\nslate waterfall. (Dr. Polis, who runs the center, sent back the\nslate once when it was not to her satisfaction.)\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   ``It makes coming to the doctor feel more like self care,'' Dr.\nPolis said. ``So if you include a massage, well, that is self care,\ntoo. There is no need to compare the importance of a Pap smear with\na facial.''\n\n   This medical mall of sorts _ where the plain vanilla medical\nneeds can be matched with aesthetic desires all under the same\nelegant fabric-covered roof _ is driven by consumer demand, she\nsaid. ``Those doctors who resist the trends in the way they deliver\nmedicine are not in tune to their patients' needs.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   When money cannot be made in procedures alone, there are\nproducts that can be sold. Dozens of businesses have opened across\nthe country in recent years to provide dermatologists with skin\ncare products. Often, the preparations they sell are similar to\nthose sold in department stores, only at a higher strength.\n\n   Dr. Steven J. Pearlman, the director of the Division of Facial\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\nCenter in New York, sells alpha-hydroxy creams to prevent skin\naging, and bleaching creams for brown spots. ``They make up for\noverhead,'' he said, declining to specify his exact profit margin.\n\n   Offering skin care products and substituting a lot of the ear,\nnose, throat and cancer-related surgeries he used to do with\ncosmetic procedures has given his practice a whole new lease on\nlife, Pearlman said.\n\n   ``With medical things, first you have to fulfill numerous\nrequirements, like getting precertified,'' he said. ``You get paid\nway later and have generated a load of paperwork. With cosmetic\nthings, it is, `Nice to meet you, here is the procedure, let's do\nit or not do it.' It is how medicine used to be.''\n","Headline":"\nDOCTORS TURN TO COSMETIC MEDICINE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INCOMES \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ In the waiting room of Dr. Mark Fromer's office in\nTrump Tower _ not so long ago filled with elderly patients seeking\ntreatment for cataract disease _ young professionals with expensive\nhaircuts whisper into cell phones as they wait for their 15-minute\nlaser eye surgery appointments.\n","\n   Patients at the SoHo Integrative Health Center in Manhattan can\nsee Dr. Laurie Polis, the center's dermatologist, for a routine\nskin cancer check, then get the wrinkles in their forehead zapped.\n","\n   Dr. Irwin Smigel, a prominent Manhattan dentist, passes people\nneeding routine fillings on to his associates; he is far too busy\napplying the latest tooth-whitening concoction on his patients.\n","\n   Until recently, doctors who specialized in so-called lifestyle\nmedicine _ elective and largely cosmetic procedures _ were limited\nto rarefied corners of the medical profession.
