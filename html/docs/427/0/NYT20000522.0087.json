Although the living can be easy, the\nseason has its own set of health concerns, from hay fever to\nblack-and-blue knees. Be prepared by assembling a first aid kit\nfilled with natural, all-purpose remedies before you head outdoors.\n\n   Repel mosquitoes and reduce the itch: The best way to steer\nclear of mosquito bites is to know when the pesky insects are most\nlikely to be around. Mosquitoes generally feed around dusk, so if\nyou can't stay indoors during this time, wear long-sleeved,\nloose-fitting clothing and tuck your pants into your socks. You may\nwant to wear such neutral colors as beige and khaki, which don't\nseem to attract bugs.\n\n   Also consider taking B-complex vitamins regularly _ mosquitoes\nfind human blood unpalatable when people are on this supplement.\nTake 100 milligrams three times a day starting a few weeks before\nmosquito season, which kicks in around April and peaks in July and\nAugust.\n\n   If these precautions don't work, try applying neem oil\n(Azadirachta indica), which can provide significant protection for\nup to 12 hours. Extracted from an Indian tree, this oil is\navailable in health-foods stores.\n\n   In the event that a mosquito does snack on you, dab Tiger Balm\nor aloe vera gel on the bite to relieve the itching.\n\n   Get the better of bee stings: Whether you're gardening or\nhiking, you may brush up against a bee or happen to disturb a hive.\nIf you do get stung, attempt to remove the stinger before it\nreleases all the bee's venom; you'll end up with a smaller, less\npainful welt. To ease the pain and inflammation, ice the area\nimmediately, then apply a paste made with baking soda and water.\nYou can also treat the bite site with full-strength tea tree oil\n(Melaleuca alternifolia) or peppermint oil (Mentha piperita),\neffective topical antiseptics, or the homeopathic gel StingStop,\nwhich contains an infinitesimal amount of stinging nettle.\n\n   Stave off summer sickness: Don't assume you're immune to colds\nSimply because it's not winter. At the first sign of a summer bug,\ntake echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), a natural antibiotic and\nimmune-system enhancer. Try A freeze-dried supplement or a\nstandardized extract. Follow directions on the package and halve\nthe dose for children.\n\n   Ease sore summer muscles: If those first few sunny-weather\noutings leave your lately hibernating muscles aching, try rubbing\ntincture of Arnica (Arnica montana) on the injured area. This\nbright-yellow daisy-like flower, a popular healing plant among\nNative Americans, speeds the healing of bruises, sprains, soreness\nand swelling; it also relieves arthritis, and muscle and cartilage\npain.\n\n   Arnica comes in a variety of other topical forms _ cream, salve,\nointment, gel and oil _ but I like the tincture. Never apply it to\nbroken skin or an open wound: It can be toxic if it gets inside the\nbody.\n\n   Take the ``ouch'' out of poisonous plants: Recognition is the\nfirst line of defense when it comes to dealing with poison ivy,\noak, and sumac. Learn to identify these plants and then avoid them.\nIf you do touch one, wash off the allergenic resin with soap and\nwater within 20 to 30 minutes of contact and slather the affected\narea with aloe vera gel, to help soothe the itch if a rash does\ndevelop.\n\n   One of the best poison-ivy treatments I know is to get in as hot\na shower as you can stand for 5 to 10 minutes. This will increase\nthe itching _ but only for a few minutes. That's when the\nnervous-system circuits seem to get overloaded, stopping the\ndiscomfort for several hours.\n\n   Beat motion sickness: There's nothing worse than embarking on a\nwell-deserved holiday and becoming dizzy or nauseated before you\neven hit the interstate. Fortunately, there are a number of\nremedies that may make it possible for you to enjoy your journey.\n\n   While traveling, try wearing acupressure wristbands, which have\na plastic peg that presses against the nausea controlling acupoint\non the inside of your wrists. The bands are available at most drug-\nand health-food stores.\n\n   Taking ginger (Zingiber officinale) also prevents and treats\nmotion sickness. Twenty minutes before travel, mix a half teaspoon\nof ginger powder in a glass of water and drink it. Or take two to\nfour capsules of powdered ginger. Ginger snaps, ginger ale and\ncandied ginger can help with mild nausea, too.\n\n   Soothe sunburn: Think prevention. Always use a sunscreen with an\nSPF of 15 or higher that contains Parsol 1789, zinc oxide, or\ntitanium dioxide. These ingredients block almost the entire\nspectrum of the sun's damaging rays. Slather sunscreen on every\nexposed part of your body each time you work up a sweat or get out\nof the water. Wear a broad-brimmed hat, lightweight pants or skirt,\nand cover your shoulders and chest.\n\n   If you do get sunburned, your skin will appreciate the cooling\nand healing effects of aloe vera. Scrape out the gel from inside an\naloe leaf or buy a lotion whose primary ingredient is aloe, then\napply a generous amount to the affected area. You can also soothe\nsunburn with cooled black tea (the tannins are what do the trick).\n\n   Heal hay fever: I have found stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) to\nbe a highly effective treatment for hay-fever symptoms, minus the\nside effects _ drowsiness and dry mouth _ of conventional allergy\nmedicines. Use a freeze-dried extract of the leaves, sold in\ncapsule form, and take one to two capsules every two to four hours\nas needed.\n\n   I also like quercetin, a bioflavonoid found in buckwheat and\ncitrus fruit, as an allergy preventive. Quercetin appears to\nstabilize the immune-system cells that release histamine, the\nmediator of allergic reactions. Take 400 milligrams twice a day\nbetween meals. Give it a few weeks to show its full effect.\n\n   Dr.Weil's summer first-aid Kit Stave off the season's troubles\nwith herbs, supplements and essential oils, all of which are\navailable at health-foods stores.
