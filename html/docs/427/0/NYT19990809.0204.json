Times News Service   \n\n     PROGNOSIS: Expecting the Best Is Good for the Heart  \n\n   Optimism and self-confidence may prove potent weapons in staving\noff a recurrence of heart disease, if a new study by Carnegie\nMellon University researchers is any indication. Patients in the\nstudy who had a positive outlook, greater self-control and higher\nself-esteem after angioplasty surgery were less likely to suffer a\nheart attack, undergo bypass surgery, or require a second\nangioplasty in the next six months.\n\n   The researchers reported their findings in the July-August issue\nof the journal Psychosomatics. Dr. Vicki Helgeson, a psychology\nprofessor at Carnegie Mellon, and Dr. Heidi Fritz of the University\nof Pittsburgh gave self-evaluations to 298 patients _ 199 men and\n99 women _ hospitalized for angioplasty to relieve blockage in\nmajor arteries.\n\n   Patients were asked how confident they were that they could\nalter health-damaging behaviors like smoking, how much they\nexercised, how optimistic or pessimistic they were in their outlook\non life, and how much support they received from family, friends\nand doctors.\n\n   Six months later, the patients were interviewed again.\n\n   Patients who were more pessimistic, scoring low on the\npsychological measures, were nearly three times as likely to have\nmore arterial blockage as people with a sunnier approach, the\nresearchers found.\n\n     RISKS AND REMEDIES: Kidney Toxins in a Nice Cup of Herb Tea  \n\n   Two women taking Chinese herbal preparations to treat eczema\nhave suffered kidney failure, according to a report in the Aug. 7\nissue of The Lancet, a British medical journal. The cases raise new\nquestions about the safety of the remedies, the report said.\n\n   ``Our cases are of great concern, since the herbal preparations\nwere from different sources and were prescribed for eczema,'' wrote\nDr. Graham Lord, a clinical research fellow at the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine in London, and his colleagues at the Hammersmith\nand Charing Cross Hospitals.\n\n   In the first case, a 49-year-old woman, who had been taking an\nherbal preparation in tablets for two years, complained to her\ndoctors of headaches and high blood pressure. The symptoms\nprogressed rapidly to renal failure, Lord wrote, and the woman had\na kidney transplant.\n\n   In the second case, a 57-year-old woman who had been drinking an\nherbal tea for six years, was admitted to the hospital with kidney\nfailure. She is still awaiting a kidney transplant.\n\n   In an e-mail exchange, Lord explained that the remedies used by\nthe women were made from a mixture of many Chinese herbs. But both\npreparations contained mu tong, a Chinese name that can refer to\nthree different plants.\n\n   The mu tong used in the remedies the women took, a laboratory\nfound, contained aristolochic acid, a chemical toxic to human\nkidneys. Aristolochic acid was also found in Chinese herbs added to\na slimming formula linked to an outbreak of kidney failure in\nBelgium in the early 1990s.\n\n   Chinese herbal medicine practitioners in the United States say\nmu tong is also sold here, usually mixed with other herbs.\n\n     NUTRITION: Chocolate, a Sweet Way to Fight Illness?  \n\n   Go ahead, bite into that Hershey bar. Chocolate, a new report\nindicates, contains high levels of catechins, substances with\nantioxidant properties that may help fight cancer and heart\ndisease.\n\n   Dr. Ilja Arts of the National Institute of Public Health and\nEnvironment in the Netherlands said she and her colleagues, authors\nof a short report last week in The Lancet, did not expect to find\nlarge amounts of catechins in chocolate. In fact, she said, they\nset out to study tea.\n\n   Scientists have long suspected that tea, which also contains\ncatechins, may have a protective effect. But studies examining the\nlink between tea and reduced risk of disease have come up with\nmixed results. And some studies, Dr. Arts said, even show an\nincreased risk with high tea consumption. To explore further, the\nresearchers looked for other foods that contained catechins. Dark\nchocolate, they found, contained 53.5 milligrams per 100 grams,\nabout four times the amount of in brewed tea. Milk chocolate had\n15.9 milligrams per 100 grams, just slightly more than tea.\n\n   Does that mean chocolate fights illness? ``We hope to clarify\nwhether or not catechins can protect against chronic diseases,''\nDr. Arts said.\n\n     TREATMENT: Oxygen May Help Save Threatened Eyes  \n\n   Giving oxygen to patients with detached retinas while they await\nremedial surgery may help decrease damage to the affected eyes,\naccording to a California researcher who has successfully tested\nhis theory on cats.\n\n   ``The bottom line is that oxygen therapy reduces the amount of\ndamage to the photoreceptor cells of the retina,'' said Dr. Steven\nK. Fisher, director of Neuroscience Research Institute at the\nUniversity of California at Santa Barbara. He suggests that\npatients with retinal detachment be provided with oxygen\nimmediately upon diagnosis to protect cells until the retina is\nreattached.\n\n   Writing in the August issue of The American Journal of\nOphthalmology, Fisher noted that photoreceptors, the\nlight-sensitive cells in the retina, have only one source of\noxygen, and if deprived, die rapidly.\n\n   In 10 cats, Fisher reported, oxygen given immediately after\ntheir retinas were surgically detached reduced damage to the eyes.\nThe researcher said he was planning additional research to see if\nthe same applied to humans.\n\n   Retinal detachments occur mostly in middle-aged or older adults,\nand in people with diabetes, but may also result from injuries in\nsports like boxing and bungee jumping. Emergency surgery is usually\nrequired, because a detached retina can lead to serious vision loss\nor blindness.\n\n   Dr. Gregory Dellone-Larkin, research director of the Department\nof Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, acknowledged\nthe potential value of oxygen.\n\n   But he cautioned that too much oxygen could sometimes be\nharmful, and in emphysema patients has led to death. He also said\nthat cat and human retinas differed substantially and recommended\nmore research.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nHEALTH AND FITNESS NOTES AND NEWS \n","Text":["\n     PROGNOSIS: Expecting the Best Is Good for the Heart  \n","\n   Optimism and self-confidence may prove potent weapons in staving\noff a recurrence of heart disease, if a new study by Carnegie\nMellon University researchers is any indication.
