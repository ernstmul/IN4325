She thought of leaving the company. She thought of\nsigning up for some career counseling sessions at a local\nnonprofit.\n\n   Instead, Orozco took advantage of an unusual employee benefit\noffered by Sun _ free on-site career counseling sessions.\n\n   Orozco ended up staying with Sun and becoming a software project\ncoordinator. Two years later, she again used Sun's counseling\nprogram to help navigate a move into project management.\n\n   ``Without career counseling, I would have left the company for\nsure,'' said Orozco, 32. ``But career services introduced me to\nother people and other departments in Sun that I never would have\nknown about. They did everything from giving me a Meyers Briggs\nskill test, to looking over my resume.''\n\n   Sun, based in Palo Alto, is one of a handful of companies that\noffer career counseling as a standard benefit for all their\nemployees.\n\n   It's a gutsy move. Many firms shy away from it, worried that\nfreely available career counseling would simply help their best\nemployees jump ship for new and better jobs elsewhere.\n\n   But Sun officials say the program _ which provides individual\ncounseling to about 250 people each month _ actually helps them\nhold on to workers in today's tight labor market.\n\n   Sun has found that attrition among employees who use career\ncounseling is about three percentage points lower than among those\nwho don't.\n\n   ``We in Silicon Valley are all competing for the same dwindling\ntalent pool, so you need to have programs to keep employees in the\norganization.'' said Carol Guterman, career services program\nmanager for Sun. ``If our career program can stop one employee a\nmonth from leaving the company, we're saving the company money.''\n\n   Twenty years ago, there was little need for the kind of\nsophisticated career-development programs now offered by Sun and\nfirms like Pacific Bell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.\n\n   Companies sometimes offered counseling to small groups of\nlaid-off employees as part of an outplacement program. But most\nfirms simply assumed that workers could figure out their own path\nthrough the organization.\n\n   ``There used to be very clear-cut career ladders, where you\ncould look on a chart and see where you were supposed to go _ from\nAnalyst 1, to Analyst 2, to Analyst 3,'' said John Parkington, an\norganizational effectiveness consultant with Watson Wyatt in San\nFrancisco. ``That's pretty much vanished. I don't know any\ncompanies in North America that are building career ladders these\ndays.''\n\n   Today, with companies constantly merging and changing, many\nemployees realize they have to draw their own personalized career\nmap.\n\n   And a growing number of employers provide some limited kinds of\ncareer help _ software programs to assess people's skills, for\ninstance, or occasional workshops on career issues.\n\n   But sustained and individualized programs like the one at Sun\nremain very uncommon.\n\n   ``Human resource folks are ambivalent about whether they can\nsell these programs to senior management because the payoff isn't\neasy to demonstrate,'' said Parkington. ``And some people say,\n`Jeez, if we give counseling to people to enhance their careers,\nthey'll just bug out.'''\n\n   Sun's program grew out of a temporary counseling center put in\nplace during a period of layoffs in the early 1990s.\n\n   ``After 18 months, there was no need for outplacement, but\nsomeone had the foresight to change it into an `inplacement'\ncenter,'' Guterman said.\n\n   Today, Sun offers four free career counseling sessions a year to\nall of its 27,000 workers, as well as other services like brown-bag\nworkshops on career issues.\n\n   About 8 percent of Sun's employees use the career services in\nany given year.\n\n   Counseling sessions are confidential and employees don't need to\ninform their managers that they've signed up.\n\n   The counselors are outside experts from the nonprofit Career\nAction Center who work at Sun on a long-term contract basis _ an\narrangement that allows them to remain independent of the company\nwhile developing an insider's knowledge of Sun's structure and\nculture.\n\n   ``We asked them to go into a site, set up their office as if it\nwere their own private practice, and get to know that division and\nthe way the organization works,'' Guterman said.\n\n   Other Bay Area companies offering significant career-development\nbenefits include:\n\n   _ Pacific Bell, which has five full-time career specialists who\nlast year provided 1,224 counseling sessions as well as various\nworkshops. Pacific Bell launched its program in 1989 in response to\na request by the Communications Workers of America.\n\n   ``The union wanted us to help employees deal with the reality of\nchange in the telecommunication industry, assessing and developing\npeople's skills so they could find the right career path,'' said\nJoan Massola, state manager of the company's career development\ncenters.\n\n   _ IBM, which has offered individual career counseling at in   its\nvarious locations since the mid-1990s.\n\n   _ Hewlett-Packard, which doesn't have a large individual\ncounseling program but has made ``career self-reliance'' a major\ncorporate goal since 1994. HP's program relies mainly on periodic\nworkshops and on a career-assessment software program called\nCareerSteps, which has been used by 6,000 of the firm's 126,000\nemployees since it was installed in February.\n\n   The software is ``an inexpensive way for an employee to do a lot\nof assessment,'' said Lauren Martin Brown, who oversees HP's career\neducation efforts. ``It doesn't have the experience or wisdom that\na career counselor does. But this is the closest most of our people\nwill ever get to having a career counselor, and the closest we want\nto come as a company to having counselors.''\n\n   At Sun, counselors help employees grapple with a wide range of\nquestions.\n\n   Recent college grads want to know how to plan their careers.\nOther new hires want help figuring out the structure of Sun.\n\n   Mid-career employees want to get out of a career rut, or switch\nfrom engineering into marketing. Employees of all kinds come in for\nhelp in improving their interview skills or retooling their\nresumes.\n\n   The counselors occasionally find themselves in the touchy\nsituation of talking with an employee who wants to leave Sun. If\nthe worker's career goals really require him or her to leave, the\ncounselors will support that decision.\n\n   But those cases are surprisingly rare.\n\n   For one thing, Sun is a large enough organization that many\nemployees manage to change careers while remaining with the\ncompany.\n\n   For another thing, employees who are determined to leave often\ndon't stop to talk to the counselors.\n\n   ``A lot of the people who are going to leave are head-hunted and\ndon't need us,'' said counselor Linda Artel. ``The people who come\nto see us tend to like the company and want to stay. One reason\nthey come to us is to find a way to stay.''\n\n   Bob Braham, 39, is a Sun manager who not only uses the\ncounseling program himself but enrolled his entire team in a career\nworkshop. Two-thirds of his 28 employees have gotten individual\ncareer counseling.\n\n   On a personal level, Braham says that counseling taught him to\nnetwork more effectively _ a skill useful to his work at Sun as\nwell as his own career.\n\n   As a manager, Braham says the career program has created more\nmotivated and loyal employees. His employees know what their goals\nare and understand how their work fits in with those goals.\n\n   ``Only one of my people has left Sun in 2-1/2 years,'' he said.\n``One reason is that they feel they can achieve their personal\nambitions working here.''\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n           \n   By Ilana DeBare  \n","\n     c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle      \n   \nLaura Orozco had been the No. 1 telephone salesperson in her\ndivision of Sun Microsystems for almost two years, but she was\ngetting bored.
