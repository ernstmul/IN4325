IT COULD BE SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER\n\n (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) \nBy CAROL BIDWELL \nc.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  \n\n   LOS ANGELES _ ``Winter blues.'' ``Winter blahs.'' ``Cabin\nfever.''\n\n   If you've ever lived where it gets cold and snowy during the\nwinter, where the ration of daylight dwindles to eight hours or\nless a day for months at a time, where blizzards snow you in for\ndays, you've probably heard those terms.\n\n   But there's another, more scientific name: seasonal affective\ndisorder, first recognized nearly 15 years ago by a pioneering\npsychiatrist who theorized that the amount of light striking a\nhuman's eyes has a lot to do with winter moods.\n\n   Since then, SAD has become the subject of research at 22 centers\nworldwide, where new treatments are being developed.\n\n   So what has this got to do with us in sunny Southern California?\nA lot, especially when storm after storm blows in off the Pacific\nor zooms down from Alaska, bringing gray days and driving rain.\n\n   ``Last year, with El Nino, there were days of heavy rains in\nDecember and January, and I saw more cases (of SAD) last year than\nany year before,'' said Dr. Joseph Haraszti, a Pasadena\npsychiatrist. ``It seems when we had not seen the sun for a week,\nmy phone was ringing off the hook.''\n\n   SAD, which for many sufferers appears annually about the time\ndaylight-saving time signs off in the fall, is characterized by\ndepression, irritability, a craving for carbohydrates that results\nin weight gain, withdrawal from others and a general tiredness, a\nneed each morning to crawl back under the covers for another few\nminutes _ or hours _ of sleep.\n\n   YES, IT'S REAL\n\n   For most of us, winter's early sunset, which forces us to drive\nhome from work in the dark, is little more than a nuisance, leaving\nus with a bit less energy, a tendency to go to bed a bit earlier at\nnight.\n\n   But many people _ ranging from about 1 percent of the population\nin Los Angeles to as many as 10 percent in Alaska _ really suffer\nfrom SAD, said Jamie Rifkin, a researcher in the Winter Depression\nProgram at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia\nUniversity Medical Center.\n\n   Los Angeles averages 245 at least partly sunny days a year, but\nAnchorage residents glimpse the sun only 121 days. That lack of\nsunlight, whether the result of a few stormy California days or\nweeks of Alaskan blizzards, can plunge some people into an annual\ndepression that goes beyond just a case of the blues.\n\n   ``This is a clinically significant disorder,'' Rifkin said.\n``Some people who have it can't get out of bed in the morning. They\nsleep 10 to 14 hours a day. They can't go to work. People overeat\nand can put on 20 or more pounds in the wintertime. It really\naffects their lives.''\n\n   It's not surprising that many people suffer as a result of light\ndeprivation, said Dr. David Avery, associate professor of\npsychiatry and behavioral sciences at Washington Harborview Medical\nCenter in Seattle, who is researching treatments for SAD.\n\n   Until the widespread use of home electric lighting, people\ngenerally rose with the sun and went to bed with the sun.\n\n   ``In our modern world, we can get exposed to fairly bizarre\nlight cues compared to what our ancestors were used to,'' Avery\nsaid. ``After all, it's probably unnatural to wake up two hours\nbefore the sun comes up.''\n\n   ONE WOMAN'S STORY\n\n   Leslie O'Dowd of Pasadena, born and raised in Michigan, knows\nwhat it's like when your body wants to sleep in the winter's dark,\nbut your alarm clock says it's time to get up and go to work.\n\n   ``I've probably felt it my whole life, but I didn't know what it\nwas until just a few years ago,'' said O'Dowd, 43, a word processor\nfor a law firm. ``It gets worse as the days get shorter. I work in\na room with no windows, and on gray days I never see the sun.\nSometimes in the winter, I just want to pop out of my skin if I\ndon't see the sun for a few days.''\n\n   As a young woman in snowy Michigan, ``I read a lot and slept a\nlot and ate a lot _ I usually gained 20 pounds during the winter _\nbut I really didn't know there was anything wrong with me,'' O'Dowd\nsaid. ``But I remember when the spring would start to show and the\nsun would come out, I'd feel so much better.''\n\n   It was only a couple of years ago, after a depression so deep\nshe'd been referred by her therapist to psychiatrist Haraszti, that\nshe learned the winter doldrums that had bedeviled her for years\nhad a name _ and that there was a treatment that would make her\nfeel better.\n\n   The doctor immediately prescribed an anti-depressant medication\nand up to a half-hour a day in front of a light box, a device that\nemits bright, white fluorescent light, devoid of the ultraviolet\nrays that cause wrinkles and cancer.\n\n   ``The day I started treatment, I felt like I was getting warm\nall over, like my body was trying to work again,'' O'Dowd said.\n\n   ``I thought it was kind of odd that you could sit under a light\n20 minutes a day and it would help you. But it did.''\n\n   RESEARCH SHED LIGHTS\n\n   Haraszti is one of a growing number of doctors who have begun to\nheed the findings of Dr. Norman Rosenthal, head of the Clinical\nPsychobiology Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health in\nBethesda, Md.\n\n   Nearly 15 years ago, when he first gave the ``winter blues'' a\nname and suggested that frequent doses of bright light could help\nlift the depression, Rosenthal found that women suffered from SAD\nthree times as often as men _ or, as with most depression, three\ntimes as many women !ital!admitted!off! feeling sad and tired.\nThose most affected ranged in age from 23 to 39, and the length of\ntheir annual depressive episodes lasted an average of 4.9 months _\nabout the length of a gray winter season.\n\n   Of SAD sufferers studied, 97 percent said they experienced\nunwarranted sadness, 95 percent reported decreased activity, 87\npercent were anxious, 72 percent said they craved carbohydrates,\nand 66 percent reported an increased appetite. A total of 77\npercent slept more, 64 percent reported decreased libido, 44\npercent gained weight, and 61 percent of women reported increased\npremenstrual mood swings.\n\n   Many who suffer from SAD have relatives with the same seasonal\ndepression, leading to the possibility that a tendency to the\ndisorder is genetic, Rosenthal found.\n\n   And, he wrote, ``while (SAD) occurs most commonly as a result of\nthe short, dark days of winter, it may also be due to dark indoor\nworking environments, unseasonable cloudy spells or ocular\ndifficulties ... For many patients with SAD, light therapy should\nbe regarded as a first-line treatment, given its high success and\nacceptance rate.''\n\n   Daily exposure to a light emitting 10,000 lux _ a measurement of\nintensity roughly equivalent to sitting in front of a window on a\nbright, summer day _ can lift SAD sufferers' moods within a week or\ntwo, Rosenthal wrote.\n\n   NEW TREATMENTS?\n\n   Since Rosenthal's original studies, other researchers have\nconfirmed his findings and are working to find out why SAD affects\nsome people and not others, why some people respond to treatment\nand some don't. They're also researching why light therapy seems to\nbe the best treatment and exploring other treatments that might\nalso benefit SAD sufferers.\n\n   The most popularly accepted theory for why light helps alleviate\nSAD is that sunlight striking the eye's retina affects the pineal\ngland, which controls the body's production of melatonin, a hormone\nthat regulates mood and induces sleep. Artificial bright light\nseems to reset the body's circadian rhythm _ its natural 24-hour\nbody clock _ to manufacture more energy-producing serotonin and\nless sleep-inducing melatonin, researchers say.\n\n   Doctors who advocate light therapy recommend that their patients\nsit in front of a light box for varying periods of time, usually\nearly in the morning. They can simply bask in the light, use it as\na reading light, or work or eat breakfast while using the light.\nDoctors recommend that users glance _ but not stare _ into the\nlight periodically so the rays penetrate the retina. Staring into\nthe light could cause eye damage, they warn.\n\n   SAD sufferers who use light therapy usually notice a lifting of\nmood within a week or two, researchers say.\n\n   In Seattle, Avery is pursuing another treatment for SAD. For the\npast few winters, he's been working with ``dawn simulators,''\nmachines being sold as kinder, gentler alarm clocks that are\nprogrammed to emit a light that grows gradually brighter during the\nlast few hours of sleep, providing an earlier ``dawn'' than nature\nsupplies during the winter.\n\n   ``You get the `dawn signal,' and you wake up earlier, more\nrested, with more energy,'' said Avery, who uses one of the light\nmachines himself to ease into dark winter mornings. ``It works for\nme. We're trying to see how many other people it affects that\nway.''\n\n   Researchers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New\nYork City are studying what may be another treatment for SAD:\nbombarding the body with negative ions. Molecules of oxygen with an\nextra electron, negative ions are created in nature by sunlight,\nradiation and moving air and water; they neutralize odors and\ncontribute to the clean air and fresh smell typical of a drive\nthrough the country.\n\n   Participants in the New York study, which is in the second of\nfour years of research, get their dose of negative ions from a\nsmall bedside machine while they sleep.\n\n   ``It's probably too early to say'' whether negative ions work as\nwell as light therapy to alleviate SAD, said Rifkin, ``but it shows\npromise. There's a lot of research left to do on treating this\ndisorder.''\n","Headline":"\nWHY SO SAD?
