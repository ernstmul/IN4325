(lb) \n By TERESA RIORDAN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Architects often protect their work from being plagiarized in\nthe same way that authors do: through copyright. Whether for a\nmystery novel or an architectural plan, copyright protects against\nunscrupulous copiers who attempt to steal a creative work word for\nword or brick by brick.\n\n   But Mark Kaufman and Donald Meeks, two architects in Houston,\nhave gone a step further. They have patented what they contend are\nnovel space-saving configurations for apartment buildings and\nsingle-family dwellings.\n\n   The patents protect not the specific plans _ as a copyright\nwould _ but rather the concepts behind the buildings.\n\n   ``We're not patenting a building,'' Kaufman said. ``We're\npatenting a circulation pattern. What we've done is solve the\nriddle of the hallway.''\n\n   The riddle for Kaufman is how to build a multifamily dwelling\nwithout the expense of a common hallway. In the case of a\nthree-story apartment complex, for example, Kaufman and Meeks have\neliminated the common breezeway, a type of hallway that slices\nthrough the middle of many apartment buildings.\n\n   Instead of opening onto the breezeway, the Kaufman-Meeks\napartments open off a series of staircases that are built on the\nexterior of the building. ``We can save from 10 to 15 percent of\nthe cost of the building by eliminating the breezeway,'' Kaufman\nsaid.\n\n   Kaufman acknowledged that in coming up with the plan, he and his\npartner had drawn upon common architectural devices _ such as the\ndead-end corridors found in high-rise buildings and the outdoor\ncorridors popular in many motel designs.\n\n   ``It's like making a new drug,'' he said. ``Most of the\ncompounds are already known _ you just mix them together in a\ndifferent way.''\n\n   The Kaufman-Meeks patents have raised concerns among builders\nand architects. The National Association of Home Builders, for\nexample, has established a task force to address the question of\narchitectural patents.\n\n   Kaufman said his firm had licensed the patents to major\ndevelopers in six states, and had settled out of court with\ncompanies he and his partner charged with infringing the patents.\n``When we believe someone has infringed on our patents, we will\ntake due course,'' he said.\n\n   Maurice Walters, an architect with Torti Gallas & Partners/CHK\nin Silver Spring, Md., doubted the novelty of the Kaufman-Meeks\napartment scheme. ``It's clever, but it's not that clever,'' he\nsaid. ``It isn't earth-shattering by any means.''\n\n   But Walters was even more dubious about the aesthetics of the\ndesign. ``Those staircases are like big snouts sticking on the\noutside of the building,'' he said. ``They're unsightly.''\n\n   Kaufman and Meeks received patent 5,761,857.\n\n   Window Lets In Ultraviolet Rays\n\n   These days, most people are trying to get less sunlight exposure\nrather than more. But Charles Chubb, a physicist in St. Louis, has\njust patented a type of window that lets in the ultraviolet, or UV,\nrays.\n\n   ``Normal glass blocks most of the biologically important\nultraviolet light,'' Chubb said. The glass in Chubb's window's lets\nin just a tiny amount of the ultraviolet light that helps the body\nmanufacture vitamin D. ``When you get your vitamin D through\nsunlight, your body self-regulates and gets just enough,'' he said.\n``When you get it through your diet you can get too much.''\n\n   The window includes special panels so that office workers can\nget maximum UV exposure during the winter but block UV light in\nsummer.\n\n   Chubb received patent 5,892,619.\n\n   A Way to Link Smoke Detectors\n\n   New homes these days must be built with smoke detectors that are\nhard-wired into the electrical system. When one of these hard-wired\ndevices detects smoke, all of the alarms in the house go off,\nregardless of the location of the fire.\n\n   Paul Godwin, an inventor in Michigan, has invented a\nbattery-operated smoke-detector system that does the same thing.\n``These can be easily installed in existing older homes without the\nhomeowner having to incur the cost of expensive rewiring,'' Godwin\nsaid.\n\n   When one smoke alarm goes off, it sends a coded signal to fellow\nsmoke alarms, which go off when they receive the signal. ``It's\nradio-frequency communication that works a lot like a garage-door\nopener,'' he said.\n\n   Godwin's system has another feature: The alarm that is\noriginally set off makes a louder, more intense sound than the\nother smoke alarms. ``This way you know exactly what part of the\nhouse the fire is,'' he said.\n\n   Godwin, who received patent 5,898,369, hopes to license his\npatent.\n\n   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be\nordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent\nand Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.\n","Headline":"\nPATENTS: PROTECTING ARCHITECTS' IDEAS; ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT THROUGH\nWINDOWS; LINKING SMOKE DETECTORS \n","Text":["\n   Architects often protect their work from being plagiarized in\nthe same way that authors do: through copyright.
