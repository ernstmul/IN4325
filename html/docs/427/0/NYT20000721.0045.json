One has to embrace the world like a\nlover. One has to accept pain as a condition of existence.''\n\n   It was one thing to quote those words in speeches, or to share\nthem with the families of the Alzheimer's patients she works with\nas medical director of SeniorCare at Miami Valley Hospital. After\nsuffering serious injuries from an attack by a German shepherd,\nWheaton is learning more about what it means to live them.\n\n   Best known locally as a medical reporter for Channel 7, Wheaton\nisn't sure when she will return to her work at the station. Because\nof nerve damage, her face is partially paralyzed. She can't smile.\n``This is not a face that can go on television,'' Wheaton says,\nrecovering at her home following the July 8 attack.\n\n   Wheaton and her husband, Terry, had arrived only the night\nbefore for a weekend visit with Terry's daughter, Becky, and her\nhusband in Tucson, Ariz. Saturday morning, Wheaton and Becky were\nthe early risers.\n\n   For most of her life, Wheaton had been afraid of dogs. But a\nwoebegone stray she picked up at Fifth and Main _ ``just a\nskeleton, really'' _ changed all that. Zoe is now a member of the\nfamily, with a beautiful golden coat and incorrigibly wagging tail.\n\n   So Wheaton didn't think twice about getting on the floor, nose\nto muzzle, with the feistier of the couple's two German shepherds,\nUlk. The dog had greeted the couple the night before by growling\nand baring his teeth.\n\n   ``You'd better be on your good behavior,'' Wheaton cooed,\n``because Terry's afraid of you.''\n\n   Wheaton never saw the dog lunge. ``I was looking at Becky, and I\nsaw it happen through her eyes,'' she said.\n\n   Because of the nerve damage, she didn't feel any pain. She\nimmediately went into cool, collected doctor mode, telling everyone\nelse what to do. ``It's ironic that, after spending my career\ntrying to undo all that, and open up, I was the one in control,''\nshe said.\n\n   Her face was black and blue, her eyes swollen shut. She\nunderwent emergency plastic surgery the same day, and, less than\ntwo weeks later, the angry scar on her right cheek has healed\nconsiderably. The nerve damage also is expected to heal eventually.\n\n   In the meantime, the woman who dispenses lessons about health\nand lifestyle has absorbed some lessons of her own. Sad as she is\nthat Ulk must be put to sleep, Wheaton said ``the biggest message\nfrom this is that everything can be a gift.''\n\n   A gift?\n\n   Wheaton explained that she can't remember the last time she had\ntwo uninterrupted weeks to read, to meditate, to bask in the\ncomfort of friends. ``How most of us live our lives, we're always\nracing, racing, racing. I do it, too. This is giving me time to do\nmy own inner journey.''\n\n   The hardest part has been all the people who are calling, asking\nwhat they can do. ``It's easy to be a giver; it's hard to be a\nreceiver,'' she said.\n\n   Wheaton will return to work at SeniorCare as soon as she can.\nAlthough she has received nothing but support from Channel 7, she\nhas put her career there temporarily on hold.\n\n   She said it's part of the journey.\n\n   ``We're all searching for the meaning of life _ and the meaning\nof life is in living it. That means the painful times must be\nembraced and nurtured and loved, just like the good times.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, OHIO _ One of Dr. Sherry Wheaton's favorite quotes comes\nfrom Morris West's The Shoes of the Fisherman. ``Reach out for the\nrisk of living with both arms.
