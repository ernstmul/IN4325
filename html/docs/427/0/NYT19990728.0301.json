Times News Service   \n\n   If driving at night has recently become more difficult, don't\nnecessarily blame your headlights. Once you move out of your 20s,\nthere's a good chance that the problem has nothing to do with your\ncar's equipment and everything to do with your age.\n\n   Baby boomers are getting old, and one sign of that is a loss of\nvisual acuity. ``When you're 45, you need 50 percent more light to\nsee as well as you did when you were 25,'' said Jeff Erion,\nlighting manager for Visteon Automotive Systems in Dearborn, Mich.\n\n   Facing the largest group of geezers in history, the automobile\nindustry has an economic incentive to make things brighter. The\nrelaxation of federal regulations and the advent of powerful\ncomputer software have made it possible for the industry to create\nnew headlight designs in record time.\n\n   In any headlight, the light needs to be properly dispersed. A\nheadlight bulb generates light back toward an aluminum-coated\nreflector, which then reflects it toward the front of the\nheadlight, which may have a plastic or glass lens. In a traditional\nparabolic headlight, up to 200 separate facets on the lens direct\nthe light onto the road, which insures that the beam is wide\nenough, evenly spread and aimed in the correct direction to\nilluminate road signs, while not shining in oncoming drivers'\nfaces.\n\n   There are other designs as well: jeweled headlights do not use\nlenses, while projection-beam headlights do.\n\n   The newest trend is the jeweled, completely clear, headlight.\nStare into a jeweled headlight (unlighted, if you're smart) and you\ncan see through it to the back of the reflector. Showing up on\nmodels from nearly all makers, these lights ``give the front of the\ncar a more three-dimensional look,''Erion said.\n\n   Until the 1980s, there was little designers could do to improve\neither a car headlight's output or looks because headlights,\naccording to lighting engineers, were the most regulated part of a\nvehicle. Cars manufactured for sale in this country had to meet\nstringent guidelines for headlight size, shape, placement and\nintensity.\n\n   All lights had to be sealed beams, in which the lens, light and\nreflector are in one unit, and had to be mounted in either one or\ntwo pairs. A good result of such standardization was that it kept\nprices down for replacing headlight units.\n\n   By the mid-1980s, federal guidelines had been eased. Headlights\ncan now be any shape _ as long as the rules governing the lights'\nbrightness, throw (how far the beam extends) and direction are\nfollowed. Ford's 1986 Taurus was one of the first models to use\naerodynamic headlights that were flush with the sheet metal. And\nheadlights no longer have to be replaced as a unit; lights can now\nuse replaceable, brighter halogen bulbs, the kind that have been\nused by most manufacturers outside the United States\n\n   The first aerodynamic headlights using replaceable bulbs had a\ndifferent shape but performed no better than their sealed-beam\npredecessors. Engineers still needed to find an elegant compromise\nthat would allow them to put enough light in the right places along\nthe road without blinding oncoming drivers. Every time a new\nheadlight shape is created, that process begins anew.\n\n   The lighting industry has toyed with a number of solutions to\nincrease nighttime illumination. Manufacturers have experimented\nwith headlights that can reflect ultraviolet light up to twice the\ndistance of conventional lamps, but for such lights to be\neffective, all road signs (and pedestrians' clothing) would have to\nbe coated with UV-reflective paint.\n\n   BMW, Lexus and other manufacturers have tried projection-beam\nheadlights, which use fish-eye lenses to concentrate the light and\nmake it appear brighter. While projection lamps are good at\nreducing stray light and glare from raindrops, ``there's a great\nflood of foreground light with projection lenses, but not so much\nin the distance,'' Erion said.\n\n   The state of the art today is high-intensity-discharge lighting.\nRather than using a glowing filament to create light, HID lamps use\nhigh voltage to generate a bluish spark between two electrodes,\nexciting the xenon gas and leading to the emission of a bluish\nlight.\n\n   These headlights create brighter illumination within government\nstandards. Because the light is blue, it appears brighter still.\nHID lights are still expensive; most are found on luxury cars.\n\n   Car models that appeal to older buyers tend to have headlights\nthat throw more light directly in front of the car, said Jeff\nMikel, senior vice president of the Guide Corp., a lighting\nsupplier, while those that appeal to younger people will often have\nheadlights that project light a greater distance.\n\n   Without computers, it would take weeks of trial and error to\ncreate a jeweled headlight. Unlike a regular headlamp, these may\nhave only 20 discernible reflecting facets, so each must be angled\nprecisely to throw the light,Mickel said.\n\n   In the next decade, expect to see HID lighting on less expensive\ncars and the introduction of a light engine,a single lighting\nsource that will transmit illumination via fiber-optic cable to\nlight up headlights, taillights and turn signals.\n","Headline":"\nLIGHTS TO EASE BOOMERS DOWN THE ROAD \n","Text":["\n   If driving at night has recently become more difficult, don't\nnecessarily blame your headlights.
