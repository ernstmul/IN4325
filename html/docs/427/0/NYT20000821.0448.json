I\ndon't know how we came up with the particular game, but the idea\nwas to see how close we could throw at one another without actually\nhitting each other.\n\n   This may have been the only chunking contest I ever won against\nBubba.\n\n   I was bending over, in the process of selecting a choice stone.\nIt was when I looked up that I spied exactly what I was looking\nfor, a smooth river rock perfect for throwing.\n\n   For a fact, that's exactly what Bubba had done with it -- threw\nit in my direction.\n\n   I raised my head just in time to see it coming but too late to\ndodge. It smacked me directly in my left eye.\n\n   I saw stars. I was stunned. For a moment I didn't know what to\ndo.\n\n   Then I saw Bubba screaming bloody murder and running toward my\nhouse, and I knew exactly what to do.\n\n   I started screaming bloody murder and running after Bubba toward\nthe house.\n\n   My mother met us at the back door. Bubba was crying, saying he\ndidn't mean to do it. I was crying, saying Bubba was the one who\ndid it.\n\n   Bubba was sent home. I was taken to the doctor. The eye was\nthrobbing something awful, but otherwise seemed to have suffered no\npermanent damage.\n\n   So the doctor said.\n\n   But to be on the safe side, he tested my eyesight.\n\n   I just knew I was going to be blind in one eye. I was half\nright. It turned out I was about half blind in both eyes.\n\n   The eye test showed I was nearsighted, same as my daddy. That's\nwhen I had to start wearing glasses.\n\n   I was in the sixth grade. Things have never been the same since.\n\n   I was the only kid in the class with glasses. At first, the\nother students treated me with great sympathy, as if I had suffered\nsome terrible tragedy, almost on a par with the loss of a parent.\n\n   I remember one of the pretty girls said she liked the way I\nlooked in glasses. Funny what you don't forget.\n\n   I remember, too, it wasn't until recess that I heard, for the\nfirst time, ``four eyes.''\n\n   My cousin Bubba never called me four eyes. My cousin Bubba never\ngot over feeling that it was somehow his fault that I wear glasses.\n\n   And for good reason -- I never let him.\n\n   My left eye has always been my bad eye.\n\n   When I had to have cataract surgery several years ago, it was\nbecause of the left eye.\n\n   And when I couldn't go to the Democratic convention in Los\nAngeles last week, it was because I had a bad case of the pink eye.\n\n   Don't ask me in which eye.\n\n   Ask my cousin Bubba.\n\n   (Joe Murray, editor-publisher emeritus of the Lufkin (Texas)\nDaily News, is senior writer for Cox Newspapers.
