You'll be\nback.''\n\n   That was 15 years ago, and now I rarely put my face into direct\nsunlight without at least a 30 block on and a big-brimmed hat. But\nthe skin doctor knew. He's probably seen it all, girls who dosed\nbaby oil with iodine, slathered it on like marinade, lay out by the\npool with an oven timer set to 15 minutes and then flipped like\nshrimp for an even tan.\n\n   Now, we're all paying the price.\n\n   Dr. Richard Glogau, chief of dermatology at the University of\nCalifornia at San Francisco, calls it photo-aging. He has invented\na four-level scale. The pictures are very, very scary. If you're\nnot careful or, if with the enthusiasm of youth you think you're\nimpervious, consider this: You can look old, really old at 40.\n\n   I also asked him what a woman would look like if she never let\nthe sun hit her: ``Denise Hale,'' he said. An Eastern European\nwhose mother told her never to go out in the sun, Denise, into her\n60s, has skin like milk. Not a mark on her. So, it is possible to\nprotect yourself.\n\n   Suntans were once a sign of the low-born, people who had to work\nfor a living. Fine ladies went to the beach covered up, sat under a\nparasol or a beach umbrella and never let their sun and skin meet.\n\n   But when the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Coco Chanel showed\nup in photographs brown as berries, suntans, particularly in the\ndead of winter, became the status symbol of the idle rich, those\nwho could afford to luxuriate in Cap d'Antibes or Tahiti.\n\n       \n\n   THE AGING FACTOR\n\n   Sunshine doesn't just burn you, it ages the skin and can produce\nbasal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. There\nare three different kinds of ultraviolet sun rays: UVBs, UVAs and\nUVCs.\n\n   The rays that we are concerned with are the B's, which are short\nrays and produce sunburn and eventually squamous cell carcinomas,\nand the more insidious UVAs, which penetrate the dermal layer of\nthe skin, break down collagen, the superstructure that keeps skin\nplump and non-wrinkled, and set loose those pesky free radicals,\nrogue ions (think rust here) that mutate skin cells into melanomas.\n\n   Think mnemonically: B's burn and A's age. UVAs are also present\non gloomy, cloudy days; they can go through nine feet of water and\npenetrate the glass windows in cars. As for the UVCs, the\nfast-depleting ozone layer has kept them away from skin thus far.\n\n   Now, when you sit in the sun, a number of things can happen. Sun\nrays raise the melanocytes, those tan-producing cells close to the\nsurface in the epidermal, or top layer, of the skin which are\ndesigned to protect the skin of races whose natural habitat is\nfairly close to the equator. Mediterranean types, Africans and\nSemitic peoples all have more melanin in their skins than Nordic\ntypes or the classic Irish/English rose who turns pink at the first\nlick of a sunbeam.\n\n   If you get a slight sunburn, the effects will show up\nimmediately with redness and discomfort. But over time, the more\ntreacherous damage shows up. It may take 20 years, but the payoff\nfor undisciplined sun exposure is photo-aging: loss of elasticity,\nsun spots.\n\n   You see them on women over 40 who have spent a lot of time in\nthe sun gardening, playing tennis, swimming and boating and have\nforgotten to slather sunscreen on their hands.\n\n       \n\n   DAMAGE CAN'T BE REVERSED\n\n   All of this damage can be slowed or prevented, but not reversed\nunless by surgical process, which is expensive, painful and not\nalways guaranteed. One of the new procedures for getting rid of\nadvanced sun damage is a TCA or Trichloracetic acid peel, which\nburns off the top layers of the skin.\n\n   (MORE ... MORE)\n\n   Says New York plastic surgeon Gerald Imber, ``With a TCA peel, a\n28 percent solution is relatively effective. You just don't look\nall that good. And you have to repeat it every couple of months.''\n\n   Another radical procedure for getting rid of sun damage is a\ncomputerized laser peel. ``It has to destroy the top layer of the\nskin,'' Imber says. ``We can do the whole face, but it is not a\npleasant thought.''\n\n   So, what to do if you don't want plastic surgery to tighten up\nyour drooping, collagen-reduced, dry, dull and lifeless skin or\nlaser resurfacing or even a chemical peel?\n\n   Alphahydroxy (AHA) and Betahydroxy (BHA) acids, used over time,\ncan exfoliate the epidermis, or top layer of your skin, and produce\nsome clarity, lighten up some sun spots and generally resurface\nyour skin ... but don't expect too much. The change is gradual and\na lot more subtle than medical procedures.\n\n   Your dermatologist can prescribe Retin-A or Renova which, again,\nover time, resurfaces your skin. For the first few months, your\nskin is dry, patchy, red and hypersensitive to sunshine. And once\nyou start on a prescribed regimen like this, you should never go\nout in the sun again without sunblock on your face and a hat on\nyour head.\n\n       \n\n   SCREENS VS. BLOCKS\n\n   Be sure to note the difference between sunblock and sunscreen.\nSunscreens _ which carry a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 2 to 15 _\ncontain products such as Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate and\nBenzophenone-3 which are sun screens. They filter out the burning\nUVB rays but allow enough in to ensure tanning. The higher the SPF\nnumber, the more protection you have.\n\n   If a product contains titanium dioxide or Z-cote, transparent\nmicro-fine zinc oxide like the white stuff lifeguards slather on\ntheir noses, it is a physical sun block, which prevents any UVB ray\nfrom damaging your skin. These are indicated by products which have\nSPFs of 20 and higher.\n\n   Which is all well and good, if you remember to 1) use a lot of\nproduct and 2) reapply every hour to account for perspiration and\nswimming, which can wash it off.\n\n   In the past two years, there is a new UBA blocker, Parsol 1789\n(Avobenzone), which is in a limited amount of products. Parsol only\nscreens out UVAs and is known to cause sensitivity in some people,\nas did the first sunscreen, PABA or Padimate-O, to which a number\nof people have developed sensitivities.\n\n   When it comes to the sun, respect the power of nature and take\nproper steps to protect yourself. Do not sun at high noon when the\nsun's rays are the strongest. Use the appropriate sunscreen or\nsunblock and reapply often. Wear a hat. Wear a tight-weave,\nlong-sleeved shirt. And don't pay any attention to some bronzed\nsupermodel.\n\n   Just because they're rich and trendy doesn't mean they're right.\n","Headline":"\nBROWN AND TAN MAY NOT BE SO LOVELY AS TIME GOES BY \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are times I wish I'd never sat in the sun.\nLike the day a dermatologist removed a pre-cancerous growth from my\nface and said: ``You were a sun bunny, weren't you?
