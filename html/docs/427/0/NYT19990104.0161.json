(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By RICHARD SALTUS  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n        For their entire 30 years of married life, Fred and Kristie\nCarter have worn glasses _ and hated them.\n\n   ``They get perspiration on them when I work out, they fog up in\nthe wintertime. I hate having to buy new ones, and the last ones I\ngot didn't do a good job,'' complains Fred, a designer of Web\nsites.\n\n   So last week, the nearsighted couple drove into Boston and\nunderwent laser vision correction, one after the other, in a\n20-minute procedure called LASIK. Each had the surgery in one eye\nand both plan to have the other eye treated in a few weeks. Once\nboth eyes have been treated, they hope to be free from glasses.\n\n   Laser vision correction is a form of refractive surgery _\nreshaping the cornea, the clear tissue that covers the front of the\neye, so that an image is focused sharply on the back of the eye. An\nolder technique, radial keratotomy, required making slits deep into\nthe cornea.\n\n   The Carters had LASIK, a relatively new form of laser surgery\nthat's quickly becoming the standard. Sometimes called ``flap and\nzap,'' LASIK calls for a skilled surgeon who makes an incision in\nthe cornea and folds back a flap of tissue, so that a laser can\nsculpt a new shape in the underlying cornea.\n\n   ``I'm very psyched about this,'' said Kristie, a software\nengineer as she sat waiting her turn at the Massachusetts Eye and\nEar Infirmary's laser center. ``It's something I've wanted for a\nvery, very long time.''\n\n   People like the Carters are fueling the accelerating bandwagon\nof laser vision correction, which rolled out with Food and Drug\nAdministration approval in 1995 of one type of laser surgery called\nPRK, but was slow to be widely embraced.\n\n   Now, with patient satisfaction spreading by word-of-mouth and\nthe reassuring results of scientific studies, the number of laser\nprocedures has been doubling in the United States _ 100,000 in\n1996, 230,000 in 1997 and an estimated 400,000 or more in 1998,\naccording to Irving Arons, director of Spectrum Consulting, which\nfollows the industry.\n\n   ``The majority of patients are extremely happy,'' says Dr.\nDmitri Azar a corneal surgeon at Mass Eye and Ear who performed\nLASIK on the Carters. ``But not everyone gets a perfect outcome,\nand if patients have unrealistic expectations'' they shouldn't do\nit.\n\n   LASIK is so new that is has not been approved by the FDA, and\nthe long-term effects are not known. Azar says there is more\nconcern about LASIK in people with very severe myopia, because more\ncorneal tissue has to be removed, potentially weakening the cornea.\n\n   The price _ ranging from about $1,800 to $2,500 per eye,\ndepending in part on the type of surgery _ remains an obstacle for\nmany people. The Carters' case was unusual: Her company's insurance\npaid for both of them to undergo treatment. Most policies don't\ncover it.\n\n   Nonetheless, eye lasers have become big business. Large chains\nof laser centers have opened across the country. Ophthalmologists\nare lining up to learn the procedures. Newspapers, radio, and the\nthe internet carry ads and infomercials. Yet it appears that this\nmarket-driven medical procedure is being carried out ethically and\nwith few disappointed consumers so far.\n\n   Still, says Azar at Mass Eye and Ear, ``if you are having no\nproblems with contact lenses or glasses and are not dissatisfied\nwith your present situation,'' it's pointless to take any risk at\nall by having laser surgery.\n\n   Risks of LASIK and similar procedures include infection,\nworsened vision, glare or haloes around lights at night, and even\nblindness. But specialists say these risks are very low _ less than\n1 percent for infection _ and almost all these problems either go\naway or can be cured.\n\n   For the Carters, who had researched the procedures thoroughly,\nthe small risks were acceptable. In interviews the day after their\nLASIK procedures, both said they could see distant objects clearly\nwith the treated eye. ``It's really neat, because without my\nglasses I was reading signs all the way home,'' said Kristie\nCarter. And neither experienced any pain or sensitivity to light.\n\n   Typically, those who seek the surgery are motivated because they\nfind glasses or contacts uncomfortable, they have recreational\ninterests or jobs where lenses are a hindrance.\n\n   The procedure that was approved in 1995, called PRK, is now\nbeing rapidly pushed aside by LASIK, which involves much less\npost-operative pain and yields clear vision sooner after the\nsurgery than does PRK. In PRK, the laser beam shaves off tissue\nfrom the front of the cornea; because the injured surface is\nexposed to the air, healing is more painful. Arons estimates that\nLASIK now makes up 80 percent of laser vision procedures. At Mass\nEye and Ear, PRK costs $1,800 per eye and LASIK is $2,200 per eye.\n\n   Even high degrees of nearsightedness can now be corrected with\nthe laser; so can hyperopia, or farsightedness, and moderate\nastigmatism.\n\n   Another innovation is reversible corneal surgery, in which a\nthin plastic ring is placed in an incision in the cornea, leaving\nthe center part of the cornea untouched. This ``instrastromal''\ncorneal ring is being used overseas for mild myopia, but is still\nexperimental in the United States. The chief advantage is that the\nring can be removed and the cornea goes back to its normal shape.\n\n   In the late 1980s and early 1990s the field of refractive\nsurgery was revolutionized by the excimer laser, which uses a\nrelatively cool beam of energy to remove a thin layer of the\ncornea, giving it a flatter shape to alter the way it focuses\nlight.\n\n   PRK was the original excimer laser correction method. PRK, or\nphotorefractive keratectomy, is still sometimes done for mild\ndegrees of nearslightedness. In PRK, all the correction is carried\nout on the surface of the cornea.\n\n   But LASIK has been a major improvement, because the laser\ncorrection actually takes place beneath the corneal surface.\n\n   First, the eyelids are clamped open and the eyeball anesthetized\nwith drops. Next, the surgeon fits a metal ring over the eyeball;\nit's held in place by a vacuum.\n\n   Then, using a miniature, automated cutting device called a\nmicrokeratome, the surgeon slices a thin flap of the cornea,\nleaving a portion of it attached, much like a hinge. He folds the\nflap back, then uses the excimer laser to reshape the corneal\ntissue beneath. The flap is then replaced, held there by suction\nuntil it heals in two or three weeks. (Another advantage of LASIK\nis this: If after a few weeks, it is found that the correction is\nnot quite accurate, the surgeon can lift the flap without making a\nnew incision, re-treat the cornea with the laser, and replace the\nflap.)\n\n   Within minutes after the surgeon is finished with LASIK,\npatients can sit up and relax in the waiting room. They will wear a\nmetal shield over the eye for several nights to prevent\n\n   accidental rubbing of the eye.\n\n   A LASIK patient can drive the next day and usually can return to\nwork; with PRK, the recovery is a little slower and the patient may\nfeel stinging or burning in the eye.\n\n   Some surgeons will do LASIK on both eyes the same day, while\nothers prefer to do one and then wait a couple of weeks to make\ncertain no complications arise.\n\n   Doctors caution older patients that once their nearsightedness\nhas been corrected with PRK or LASIK, they'll likely be unable to\nread or see close-up objects clearly without reading glasses.\nHowever, more and more surgeons are offering the option of\ncorrecting one eye for distance vision and the other for reading _\na strategy called monovision _ though not everyone can comfortably\nadjust to it.\n\n   More so than with PRK, ``LASIK is very dependent on the skill of\nthe surgeon; that's why patients have to very careful'' in choosing\nwho will perform it on them, says Dr. Ernest Kornmehl, medical\ndirector of the Center for Laser Vision Correction in Brookline and\na spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\n   He advises potential LASIK patients to seek out a\nboard-certified ophthalmologist who has had fellowship training in\ncorneal surgery, been thoroughly trained in LASIK, and has\nperformed it 50 to 100 times.\n\n   What results can you expect? For both PRK and LASIK treatment of\nnearsightedness, 95 percent or more of patients end up with 20-40\nvision or better. That's the minimum acuity needed for a driver's\nlicense in most states. About half of the patients get 20-20\nvision, but sometimes that's after a second ``enhancement''\nprocedure, done about three months later.\n\n   Kornmehl says 83 percent of his patients with mild to moderate\nnearsightedness achieved 20-25 vision or better, and after\nenhancement, 92 percent had 20-25 vision or better.\n\n   For those with more severe nearsightedness, only 58 percent had\n20-25 vision after the first LASIK. But with enhancement, that\nfigure rose to 93 percent.\n\n   In practical terms, this means that LASIK or PRK may free your\nfrom glasses, but there's also a chance you might need a weak pair\nof spectacles for driving at night or other demanding situations.\n\n   Another of Azar's LASIK patient who was treated the same day the\nCarters were said she won't mind at all if she needs reading\nglasses, because the procedure has been so liberating in other\nvisual ways.\n\n   ``It's amazing, it's wonderful,'' said the woman, who is from\nWeston but asked that her name not be used. For the first time in\nher life _ she's worn glasses since age eight, ``I woke up in the\nmorning and the world was in focus.''\n","Headline":"\nAFTER WARY START, LASER EYE SURGERY BOOMS \n","Text":["\n        For their entire 30 years of married life, Fred and Kristie\nCarter have worn glasses _ and hated them.\n","\n   ``They get perspiration on them when I work out, they fog up in\nthe wintertime.
