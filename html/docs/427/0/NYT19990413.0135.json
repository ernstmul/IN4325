Short of going nocturnal,\nyour best defense is covering up and slathering on.\n\n   For clothing, invest in a wide-brimmed hat or cap and look for\nlightweight and light-colored cottons that will protect from the\nsun's rays while still feeling comfortable in heat and humidity.\n\n   Your sunscreen should have an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15.\nIf you are going to be in the sun for prolonged periods, consider a\nsunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.\n\n   Use sunscreen early and often. Experts recommend applying it 15\nto 30 minutes prior to exposure. And reapply sunscreen frequently,\nparticularly if you're in the water.\n\n   Also pay attention to the clock.

Not only are\nmosquitoes and ticks pests, but the creatures also can transmit\ndisease.\n\n   Mosquitoes are most active early in the morning and at dusk. Be\nprepared. Use a repellent that contains the chemical DEET. But\ncheck with a doctor before applying any repellent on young\nchildren. Often a better way is to apply it to their clothing, not\ntheir skin.\n\n   To avoid ticks, wear light-colored clothing as it makes the\nblood-suckers easier to spot. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants\nand tuck your pants into your socks. Pest repellents that contain\nDEET also can help.\n\n   When outdoors, make frequent inspections for ticks. If you find\none, remove it carefully using tweezers. For best results, grasp\nthe pest as close to the skin as possible and pull with a slow,\nsteady motion. Rather than yanking it off, the goal is for the tick\nto let go.
