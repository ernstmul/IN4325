If the device is deliberately shone\nin someone's eyes, the offender could be charged with assault, the\nmemo warned.\n\n   ``We told principals to look at the intent of how it's used,''\nOlchefske said. ``If it's used as a malicious weapon, you have to\nlook at far more serious sanctions.''\n\n   Olchefske said he hadn't heard about any incidents where laser\npointers had been used as a weapon in Seattle schools.\n\n   Warning labels on the product tell consumers not to shine the\ndevices in their eyes, retailers say.\n\n   Doctors say the beam will only cause damage if shone directly\ninto the eyes for about 10 seconds.\n\n   ``The bottom line is that if they are used properly, there's no\nrisk,'' said Dr. Robert Kalina, a opthamology professor at the\nUniversity of Washington. ``If you stared into it for more than 10\nseconds, I think there would be some damage to the retina. But\nyou'd have to work at it.''\n\n   Most people would instinctively blink and turn away from the\nlight before that, Kalina said. Still, there's no harm in being\ncautious, he said.\n\n   ``Never underestimate what teenagers will do,'' Kalina said.\n``There may be someone who would deliberately try something like\nthat.''\n\n   The most inexpensive laser pointers emit a low-intensity beam of\nred light for about 100 yards and were originally designed to\nhighlight text during classroom or business presentations.\n\n   As the gadgets became cheaper and smaller, their popularity with\nteenagers took off. Stores sell laser pointers for $30 to $100,\nsaid Dennis McCrae, Radio Shack's district sales manager.\n\n   ``They're very popular,'' he said. ``Most kids don't have $70 to\nbuy them, but their parents do because the kids want them.''\n\n   At South Shore Middle School in South Seattle, Principal Bihoa\nCaldwell said the main problem has been male students using the\npointers to highlight girls' breasts and other body parts.\n\n   ``It's the latest toy,'' she said. ``We've told students we'll\nnot only take them away, but if they're shining it in someone's\neyes, we'll treat it as an assault.''\n","Headline":"\nSEATTLE SCHOOLS BAN LASER POINTERS \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Penlike laser pointers, the latest high-tech fad among\nteenagers, have been banned in Seattle schools following a rash of\ncomplaints about pranksters aiming the red beams of light at human\ntargets.\n","\n   Acting Superintendent Joseph Olchefske said that both safety\nconcerns and students' disruptive behavior with laser pointers\nprompted the district to ban the devices for students.\n","\n   ``These laser pens can be everything from a distraction to a\nreal danger,'' Olchefske said. ``We see them as a real problem and\nwant to get them out of the schools.''\n","\n   School districts around the country, from New York City to\nChicago, also have banned the hand-held laser pointers in the wake\nof complaints from teachers, students and even school bus drivers,\nwho reported near-accidents after having the beam flashed in their\neyes on the highway.\n","\n   In a memo this month, the Seattle School District's legal\ncounsel advised principals to notify parents that possession and\nuse of laser pointers by students is prohibited.\n","\n   Students who aim laser pointers at another person could face\ncharges of disruptive conduct.
