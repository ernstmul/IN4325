The class geek. The nerd behind\nCoke-bottle lenses.\n\n   Ian Williams, 31, of Hollywood has felt that way since the third\ngrade _ when he got his first pair of glasses.\n\n   In college, he tried to chuck that poor self image by trading\nhis glasses for contact lenses. But they were such a bother.\n\n   So five years ago, when Williams first heard about laser eye\nsurgery, he began doing research in hopes of tossing his thick\nspecs for good.\n\n   Follow Williams' lead, say medical experts. If you're tempted to\ntry new eye-surgery procedures, do your homework first, because it\ncan be a scary and dangerous proposition to pick just any surgeon\nto operate on your eyes.\n\n   Too busy to do the research? The Better Business Bureau and the\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmologists will eliminate that excuse.\n\n   The BBB recruited Dr. Peter McDonnell, medical director of the\nUSC/Doheny Refractive Laser Medical Center in Los Angeles and one\nof the top ophthalmological surgeons in the United States, to help\nmake a video explaining refractive eye surgery and telling\npotential patients what they need to know before having the\nprocedure done.\n\n   The tape should be available in most libraries by late May or\nearly June.\n\n   ``Refractive surgery by laser is a huge emerging market, and we\ndecided that, to prevent any problems, we needed to change people\nfrom just being patients to being good consumers,'' said Donald\nBurkholder, head of BBB Video Productions. The organization has\nproduced how-to videos on a number of subjects, from how to buy a\nrecreational vehicle to how to choose a mechanic to work on your\ncar.\n\n   ``We found that a lot of people feel like they're insulting\ndoctors by asking them questions,'' Burkholder said. ``They have\nthe God complex: `Whatever the doctor says, I'll do.'''\n\n   But McDonnell says patients who question a doctor about anything\n_ from the price of a procedure to his training to his equipment to\nhis success rate _ should get fast, straight answers. If not, he\nsaid, they should find another doctor _ especially when considering\na delicate operation on their eyes.\n\n   ``You wouldn't leave a car for someone to fix unless you thought\nthe guy you left it with knew what he was doing,'' McDonnell said.\n``And I think your eyes are certainly more important than your\ncar.''\n\n   Choosing a surgeon wasn't something Williams wanted to do on a\nwhim.\n\n   ``I wanted to find the right doctor,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't\ngoing to have somebody slice open my eyes without checking him\nout.''\n\n   Satisfied with the track record of the USC/Doheny center, which\ndoes 300 to 400 of the surgeries per month, Williams chose Dr.\nWilliam May, the institute's president, to do the procedure he\nhoped would change his life.\n\n   The procedure he used is called LASIK (laser assisted in situ\nkeratomileusis) surgery, where an instrument called a microkeratome\nis used to cut a thin flap on the cornea's surface so a laser can\nreshape the cornea.\n\n   The surgery would be bloodless, because there are no blood\nvessels in the cornea, and painless, although he'd feel pressure\nfrom several instruments, May told him. Williams knew there were no\nguarantees, no way to assure he'd have perfect vision after the\nsurgery. He might still have to wear reading glasses, and he was\ntold the surgery might have to be repeated as his eyes change with\nage. But he was assured that his eyesight _ so poor without that he\ncould only see clearly less than 6 inches without his glasses _\nwould improve drastically.\n\n   Last week, Williams stretched out in a tiny operating room,\nready for surgery at last. After anesthetizing Williams' eyes with\ndrops, May cut two tiny flaps from the surface of each eyeball,\nthen the rat-tat-tat sound of the laser filled the room as a\npinpoint beam of light reshaped Williams' corneas.\n\n   Forty seconds for the right eye; 40 seconds for the left eye.\n\n   Then the flaps were smoothed back into place.\n\n   Within five minutes, Williams was reading the tiny letters on an\neye chart _ without glasses. His vision was a little blurry, but\nimproving by the minute.\n\n   ``Congratulations!'' May told him. ``You've just seen well\nenough to pass the California driver's license test. And your\nvision will only get better for the next two weeks or so.''\n\n   ``Awesome!'' was all an emotionally exhausted Williams could\nsay. ``Awesome.''\n\n   The result of all his homework was finally paying off. Over the\nyears, Williams had checked out a variety of doctors and hospitals,\nread a virtual library of articles about the surgery and picked one\nof the most respected hospitals in the country to do the procedure.\n(Insurance usually doesn't cover the surgery, so Williams' dad\noffered to help pay the $4,400 bill _ $2,200 for each eye.)\n\n   Not everybody who's had laser eye surgery has been as lucky as\nWilliams. Based on ads promising perfect vision, many have believed\nfraudulent or overblown claims, made by doctors who perhaps have\nnot been properly trained to perform the delicate surgery.\n\n   A few patients who've trusted the wrong doctors _ perhaps\nwell-meaning but using cheap lasers of doubtful accuracy _ have\ngone blind after the surgery. Others have suffered infections and\ncorneal burns that have required cornea transplants.\n\n   So blatant were some doctors' claims that the Federal Trade\nCommission has warned eye surgeons to tone down their advertising\n(``Throw away your eyeglasses'' and ``Have perfect vision'' are\nalmost always false claims, says the FTC), and the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration has cautioned that any lasers operated without\nFDA approval, or without being part of an FDA-approved clinical\ntrial, will be seized.\n\n   Especially dangerous are the unregulated, unapproved ``black\nbox'' lasers, purchased cheaply and imported from overseas, says\nthe FDA. The lasers earned the derogatory term because their\nstrength and precision, both untested, is a mystery.\n\n   Although the FDA can regulate the laser equipment itself, it's\nup to state and national medical boards to crack down on untrained\ndoctors who use lasers improperly, said Michelle Stevens,\nspokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmologists. And\npolicing all those doctors is becoming a harder job, she said.\n\n   ``As managed care is cutting into doctors' earnings, (laser\nsurgery) is a way for doctors to make more money,'' she said.\n\n   The approved laser USC/Doheny and most other eye centers use\ncosts $550,000, but a ``black box'' laser can be purchased overseas\nfor $80,000, McDonnell said.\n\n   And because there's no standard for training for the relatively\nnew surgery, any eye surgeon can buy a laser and start operating on\npatients' eyes, he said.\n\n   ``The prospects are scary,'' McDonnell said. ``And if it doesn't\nseem scary to you, I don't think you're taking this surgery\nseriously. You have to be careful about self-proclaimed experts.\nSome of them aren't experts at all.''  \n","Headline":"\nCHOOSING A LASER EYE SURGEON TAKES 20/20 FORESIGHT\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _      Four eyes.
