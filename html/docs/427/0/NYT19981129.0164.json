In the process, Mann has\naccumulated a personal wealth estimated at $500 million, allowing\nhim to fund the planned construction of biomedical research centers\nat the University of Southern California and the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles.\n\n   ``My life has been a fairy tale,'' the nuts-and-bolts scientist\nsaid, apparently as amazed as anyone at his good fortune.\n\n   Now well past the age when most of his peers have retired, Mann\nis embarking on some of his most ambitious projects to date,\napplying 50 years of engineering prowess to conditions as varied\nand stubborn as blindness and AIDS.\n\n   While the projects are daunting, even fantastic by some\nreckoning, those who have worked with Mann say he has seldom taken\non a job he didn't see through.\n\n   ``I'd call this (guy) the most excellent medical device story of\nthe century,'' gushed Salomon Smith Barney analyst Melissa Wilmoth.\n\n   Fairy tale, indeed.\n\n   At the heart of Mann's business fiefdom is MiniMed, based in the\nsuburban Los Angeles community of Sylmar approximately 24 miles\nnorth of downtown, and it is at that 485-employee company that much\nof the work which most excites Mann is being done.\n\n   MiniMed specializes in diabetes-control devices, including a\npopular insulin infusion pump that eliminates the need for repeated\ndaily injections of the glucose-regulating drug. The company has\nseen sales climb to roughly $100 million annually and is considered\nthe U.S. firm best poised to profit from a growing awareness,\nparticularly among health plans, of the need for aggressive\ntreatment of types 1 and 2 diabetes.\n\n   ``This (insulin pump) market is only 6 to 7 percent penetrated\nin the U.S.,'' said Scott Wilkin, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read\nin New York. ``There's a lot of legs left in it.''\n\n   Parallel to the pump, MiniMed has been developing an implantable\nsensor for continuous, real-time testing of a diabetic's blood\nsugar level, eliminating the need for repeated finger pricks to\ndraw blood. By combining that sensor with the pump, Mann hopes to\n``close the loop,'' producing the world's first artificial\npancreas, able to simultaneously monitor and adjust a diabetic's\nglucose level.\n\n   ``It would be revolutionary, the end of the problems of diabetes\nas we know it,'' said Dr. Francine Kaufman, former president of the\nAmerican Diabetes Association and a professor of medicine at USC.\n\n   Kaufman said that while the technological hurdles involved have\nto date prevented the development of such a device by others, ``I\nhave no doubt Al Mann will do it. He is a visionary.''\n\n   Using much the same concept, Mann and MiniMed are pursuing a\npump system for more effective dosing of AIDS drugs.\n\n   Patients on certain AIDS medications take pills or injections\nthroughout the day to compensate for the drugs' short\neffectiveness, periods often as small as two hours. To dampen the\npeak-and-valley effect that such a regimen inevitably causes,\npatients are kept on doses high enough so that even when the drug\nlevel in their bodies tapers off prior to their next injection, it\nis still concentrated enough to fight the AIDS virus.\n\n   Mann is working on a pump system that, as with insulin, would\ndribble the drug out steadily and at ideal concentrations. The\nanticipated result is that patients could cut their current doses\nby up to 98 percent with no drop in efficacy.\n\n   ``At higher drug concentrations the side effects are greater and\nthere are more costs. The whole idea is to try to minimize those,''\nMann said.\n\n   While pumps dominate MiniMed, neural stimulation is the theme at\nAdvanced Bionics, another Mann company in Sylmar. Arguably more\nresearch-oriented than MiniMed, the firm uses artificially\ngenerated electrical impulses to simulate bodily functions such as\nhearing and muscle control.\n\n   To date, Advanced Bionics' biggest hit has been a cochlear\nimplant that allows a wide category of profoundly deaf patients to\nhear. ``That's not a small feat,'' Mann said. But now Mann has\nturned his sights on vision.\n\n   ``It's a straightforward approach,'' Mann said, though what he\ndescribes is anything but. By attaching hundreds of electrodes to a\nlight-sensitive computer chip and then connecting each lead to the\noptic nerve, the hope is that Advanced Bionics engineers can\nconstruct an artificial eye.\n\n   The problem is the number of electrodes, Mann said. ``Right now\nwe have about 60 and in the near future should have a few more. But\nyou need on the order of a thousand,'' he said. ``We have an\nin-house time line of four years if everything goes right.''\n\n   Similar technology is being explored for restoring muscle\ncontrol to paraplegics, continence to people who have lost bladder\ncontrol and for the easing of chronic pain.\n\n   As with most of Mann's undertakings, Advanced Bionics' work\npromises not only a better quality of life for the devices' users\nbut enormous profits for its creator. Indeed, while Mann has said\nmoney is no longer a strong motivator, he is a true believer in the\nlink between science and business. Fostering that connection is the\npurpose of the university centers he is funding.\n\n   ``The whole concept of these institutions is to . . . be a\nbridge, to create on a university campus an industrial lab that\nlicenses its research to companies for manufacturing and\nmarketing,'' he said.\n\n   The first of the centers is expected to be opened at USC before\n2000, with the UCLA facility to follow.\n\n   With arguably his fullest plate ever, Mann, a divorced father of\nsix, said he has no time to worry or desire to slow down.\n\n   ``Us older guys get up at night and go to the bathroom a lot.\nWhen I get up, sometimes I have difficulty falling asleep again.\nBut it's no worry; I'm usually thinking about some device I'm\ntrying to figure out. . . .
