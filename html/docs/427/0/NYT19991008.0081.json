Astigmatism, caused by an irregularly curved\ncornea, blurs vision as well. I had both, and badly, when I decided\nto undergo LASIK, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis and\ncurrently all the rage for restoring normal vision.\n\n   At the onset, you should know this: LASIK is not for the faint\nof heart. Consider the informed consent agreement I signed: ``I\nunderstand it is possible that a perforation of the cornea could\noccur, causing devastating complications, including the loss of\nsome or all my vision.''\n\n   Other daunting warnings include the possibility of\n``starbursting'' around lights, resulting in a halo effect,\nincreased difficulty focusing at night and permanent\nover-correction from nearsightedness to farsightedness.\n\n   I pressed on; some understandably do not.\n\n   Known as ``flap and zap'' in the industry, LASIK treats the\nmiddle layers of the cornea to correct nearsightedness,\nfarsightedness and astigmatism. Numbing drops are administered to\nprevent pain. A vacuum ring props the eyelids open. A thin flap is\nsliced on the cornea with a device called a microkeratome and\nfolded back. Microscopic layers of the exposed tissue are vaporized\nwith an excimer laser to slightly reshape the cornea.\n\n   The actual application of the laser takes 10 to 90 seconds, and\nthe hinged flap is gently returned to its original position. In the\nbest-case scenario, the eye heals without incident and the chance\nof seeing 20/40 or better (the legal vision to drive without\nglasses) can exceed 90 percent.\n\n   ``From the patients' perspective, it's a miracle. It's an\nextraordinary transformation of their vision,'' says Dr. Douglas\nKoch, professor of ophthalmology with Baylor Laser Vision at\nHouston's Baylor College of Medicine and the physician who\nperformed my procedure.\n\n   In the last year, the demand for LASIK surgery has skyrocketed,\nfrom 200,000 procedures in 1998, to an expected 800,000 this year.\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, race-car driver Bryan Herta\nand a legion of professional sports players have bared their\neyeballs for the laser.\n\n   Ophthalmologists' offices are mobbed with people who want to\ntoss their glasses and see the world in all its peripheral glory.\nThey want to water-ski and workout without prescription goggles.\n\n   Vanity certainly plays a part, but most want the simple\npleasures: waking up in the morning and reading the alarm clock;\nfalling asleep on the couch while watching TV.\n\n   That was me. I've awoken so long to dimness and stumbled around\nin a world full of blobs, I just wanted to sharpen some edges. I\ndid a massive Internet search and considered the options, the\nsurgeries, the risks and benefits, the clinics and the doctors. By\nthe time I walked into Baylor's Alkek Eye Center a year ago, I was\na go.\n\n   At least from my end.\n\n   My first ``screening'' to determine if I was a good LASIK\ncandidate was a bust. According to Koch, a pioneer in the field, I\nhave what are called ``trace'' cataracts in the center of both\neyes. If the cataracts were growing, they could require surgery as\nsoon as a year or two, Koch said; it would be imprudent to subject\neach eye to two surgeries in that short space of time.\n\n   Now that was a devastating complication.\n\n   As it turned out, a second screening four months later showed\nthat the cataracts were stable, not growing, and could be decades\naway from being a problem. Now I was a go.\n\n   Of the actual surgery, I can tell you this: I was trembling and\ngiven a Valium (thank you, laser team). I got a running\nplay-by-play (thank you, Dr. Koch). It was over in a flash and\ndidn't hurt (thank you, God).\n\n   I'd like to say I awoke the next morning to a brand-new world,\nbut that's not the way it went.\n\n   One eye was good from the get-go; my vision so bright and clear,\nI drove that afternoon. The other was bad from the start; my vision\npained and blurred from debris (dead cells, deposits and the like)\nthat had ended up beneath the corneal flap.\n\n   The next month was hell. The bad eye was as bad as the good eye\nwas good. It hurt, kept me up at night, interfered with work,\nworried me no end. No matter what combination of drops the doctors\nprescribed, the debris didn't go away, and neither did the pain. I\nfelt fragile, blind.\n\n   Koch kept telling me they had ways of getting me to where they\nwanted me. In the end, that way was lifting the corneal flap,\nscraping away the debris and irrigating the heck out of it. That\nwas longer than the initial surgery and, since I was now less\nconfident, it was scarier. But it worked.\n\n   The next day, I finally awoke to that brave new world, and my\nlife has not been the same since. I see the alarm clock in the\nmorning. I see the leaves on the trees outside, in all their\ndazzling detail. I see my mom's needlepoint on the wall, not just\nthe pink of the flowers and the green of the leaves, but the actual\ndots of the thread. I see all this, and I am profoundly grateful.\n\n   At Baylor, Koch and his partner, M. Bowes Hamill, turn away\nperfectionists who will be disappointed with anything less than\ncontact-lens clarity.\n\n   ``That level of expectation is too high,'' says Koch. ``This is\nelective surgery. You have to be twice as careful with this. The\nstakes are much higher.''\n\n   Hamill, an ophthalmologist for the Houston Astros, discouraged\ntwo professional baseball players who were seeking LASIK surgery.\nThe men wore contact lenses only during games, and Hamill told them\nthe slight risk inherent in LASIK wasn't worth the convenience.\n\n   ``We are pretty careful about it. This is not a mill,'' says\nHamill. ``Our goal is not high volume.''\n\n   LASIK normally costs $2,000-plus per eye. It's not usually\ncovered by health insurance, doesn't always work and, when it\ndoesn't, your vision could be worse for life.\n\n   Dr. Peter McDonnell, chairman of the American Academy of\nOphthalmology's Refractive Surgery Interest Group, says about 1\npercent of his patients have had worse vision; Koch and Hamill put\ntheir complication rate at 1 percent or less.\n\n   I was a temporary member of that 1 percent club. But last week,\nstill in the six-month healing period, I read the eye chart\nsomewhere between 20/20 and 20/16 with both eyes. That varies\ndepending on how tired I am, how long I've stared at the computer\nand how dry my eyes have gotten. I still need reading glasses; that\nloss of focusing is caused by age and is not surgically\ncorrectable. I still sometimes strain to see. I still worry about\nthe cataracts and the long-term health of my eyes.\n\n   Beyond three years, the consent form plainly tells you, the\neffects of LASIK are not known. Your vision could regress, your\nnearsightedness could return. But then I knew, even as they were\nthrowing all those different drops at my bad eye, that, to a\ndegree, these doctors are charting new territory.\n\n   I don't really care.\n\n   At midlife, I won't be around to catch a fraction of what the\nmillennium brings in the way of medical miracles, and I envy all\nthose who will.\n\n   But I have lived long enough to see a lifetime of blurriness\nsnap into shocking clarity, and I'll take that.\n\n   I'll awake to my mom's needlepoint in the morning, walk out the\ndoor in my high-toned sunglasses, look at the day in all its\nbrilliance and, for however long it lasts, I'll say a grateful\nprayer.   \n   \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nA CLEAR CHOICE: WRITER SHARES HER EXPERIENCE WITH POPULAR EYE\nSURGERY \n\n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ If you have always struggled to see, then you have\nalways known me.\n","\n   I was the kid the teacher thought was slow because I couldn't\nsee the blackboard; the geek in the Coke-bottle glasses that\neveryone called four eyes; the one who went from hard contacts to\ngas permeable to soft and finally back to glasses, this time,\nbifocals.\n","\n   If you have struggled to see forever, then you know why I spent\nmore than $4,300 five months ago to fix what, for most of my life,\nhas been unfixable.\n","\n   Myopia, or nearsightedness, is caused by eyes that are too long\nfrom front to back.
