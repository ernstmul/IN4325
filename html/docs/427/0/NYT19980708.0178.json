Pull on a pair of oversized plastic shades\nand you, too, can be a movie star like Sophia Loren in the '50s. Or\ntry some sassy cat's eyes and impress the mall rats with your\nfashion savvy. Or look like you know the club scene (even if you\ndon't) with those new yellow or blue-tinted lenses. Or be square\nwith the style that's linked to Cary Grant.\n\n   Sunglasses are sold everywhere, from amusement parks to\ndrugstores to specialty spec shops. And the prices run the gamut\nfrom $7.99 to $200. Just make sure that the lenses offer protection\nfrom the sun's harmful UV rays.\n\n   But if you're going for the total image concept, you'll want a\ndesigner label (think of it as '80s retro), and you need to know\nthe key players. So, the European names to drop _ or wear\nprominently on the temple piece of your sunglasses _ are Gucci,\nChanel and Frederic Fekkai, who recently opened a boutique on Rodeo\nDrive.\n\n   However, American designer Calvin Klein has a suave new design\nwith a bold oval contour plus UVA and UVB protection that's equal\nto any of those European shades. It's called the Avenger, and will\nbe launched at sunglass and department stores to coincide with\nWarner Bros.' Aug. 14 release of ``The Avengers.''\n\n   And, of course, you'll need different pairs for all your\nwardrobe changes.\n\n   According to Mitchell Simmons, a spokesman for Ray-Bans, this is\na dial-a-decade year, with numerous retro designs making a\ncomeback.\n\n   The company known for producing the first mass-marketed\nsunglasses (and a fave with Tom Cruise) has brought back its\noriginal styles from the '30s (delicate metal frames and spring\nhinges); the '50s (cat's eyes and big squares); the '70s (oversized\nplastic bubble shapes and aviators); and some futuristic wrap\nstyles in gunmetal gray.\n\n   When it comes to shape, almost anything goes, but rectangular\nlenses are the newest trend, says Sunglass Hut spokeswoman Sherry\nLay. And the color palette is huge, with a strong interest in blue\nand yellow, and metallics with shiny car finishes. You'll find them\nin plastic or metal, or a combination, and often with tinted\nlenses. The ``fade'' lense is back, too, but no word yet on\nrhinestones and initials like we saw in the late '70s.\n","Headline":"\nSHADES WITH STATUS\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _      Sunglasses do sooo much more than shade your eyes\nfrom those nasty ultraviolet rays and camera flashes.\n","\n   It's all about 'tude.
