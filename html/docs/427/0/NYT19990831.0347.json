Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n   Sun's free office software applications, which also include\npresentation software, e-mail and calendar programs, are remarkably\nsimilar to the applications in Microsoft's best-selling Office\nSuite, which costs $400 and has be to loaded onto a personal\ncomputer.\n\n   Microsoft has been the undisputed leader in office software. Its\nOffice Suite has attracted about 100 million customers and accounts\nfor approximately 40 percent of the company's total revenue.\n\n   Industry observers believe Sun may be making a tactical error by\ngoing after Microsoft in the office software market.\n\n   ``I don't think Sun will make an impact, because 75 percent of\noffice software is bought by corporations, not individuals,'' said\nLaura Lederman, an analyst with William Blair & Co. ``Corporations\nwill stick to Windows-based products because they have made huge\ninvestments in the stuff, and it works.''\n\n   She added that technology managers are typically quite\nconservative and may be reluctant to embrace the idea of\nInternet-based productivity software because of the inherent\nbandwidth and reliability issues. ``I don't know if Sun has enough\npower on its own to change the office software market,'' she said.\n\n   Despite clear evidence to the contrary, Sun officials insist\nthey are not targeting Microsoft. ``We're going after the future,\nnot (Microsoft),'' insists Brain Croll, a senior director of\nproduct marketing for Sun. ``There is a massive trend toward\nInternet applications, and the next logical step is to bring the\noffice environment into this domain.''\n\n   Microsoft, for its part, does not yet have a plan to offer its\nsoftware over the Internet. The Sun-Star Division model poses a\ndilemma for the company, because if it starts offering its software\nfor free on the Web, it will lose an important revenue stream.\n\n   But if the concept of Web-based computing catches on, Microsoft\ncould be left in the cold and could lose valuable market share.\nMicrosoft could not be reached for comment.\n\n   Star Division was founded in Germany in 1985, but founder Marco\nBoerries later moved the company headquarters to Fremont. It\nemploys 155 people, and all will be offered jobs with Sun.\n\n   Under the deal, the majority of Star Division's workers will\nremain in Germany. Meanwhile the 25-odd sales and marketing\nemployees in Fremont will be integrated into Sun's facilities in\nMenlo Park, according to Croll.\n\n   Boerries will join Sun as vice president and general manager of\nWeb-based appliances.\n\n   Sun said yesterday that it is creating its own Internet portal\nwhere users can go to access Star Division's office applications on\nan as-needed basis. The so-called StarPortal will become\noperational in the fall.\n\n   In the meantime, Sun said users can download desktop versions of\nStarOffice for free at www.sun.com/staroffice. The StarOffice\nsoftware runs on the Linux, Window, OS/2 and Solaris platforms.\n\n   The market for Internet-based computing applications is gaining\nsteam. To date, high-end software for such tasks as manufacturing\nand accounting _ as well as e-mail and calendaring applications _\nhave been offered over the Web in a hosted environment.\n\n   The Sun-Star Division deal represents the first time that more\n   basic applications like word processing and spreadsheets have\nmoved to the Internet.\n\n   ``The last holdout, it seems, has been office productivity\nsoftware,'' said Sun chief executive Scott McNealy in an open\nletter posted on Sun's Web site. ``You might describe today's\nannouncement as one small step for office software, one giant leap\nfor the Web.''\n\n   Sun is hoping to gain broader acceptance of its Web-based\ncomputing initiative by forging alliances with Internet service\nproviders and other Web-based companies. Sun is giving these\npotential partners StarOffice for free so that they will\nincorporate the software into their normal services.\n\n   One such partner, Portera Systems Inc. in Campbell, said it will\ncombine StarOffice with its own line of software. ```We don't\nexpect our customers to move off of Microsoft Office,'' said\nPortera chief executive Gary Steele. ``But if they need to use,\nsay, a spreadsheet tool, they can now do that within our software,\ninstead of having to switch out of our program, go into Microsoft\nExcel and then transport the data back.''\n\n   Though Sun is offering StarOffice for free, it expects to make\nmoney. First, it plans to charge corporations and service providers\nfor installation, maintenance and technical support.\n\n   Also, Web-based applications like StarOffice provide greater\nimpetus for companies to buy Sun's core server products, which are\nneeded to run the software.\n\n     \n   \n   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)      \n     \n","Headline":"","Text":["\n     By Tom Stein  \n","\n     Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle      \n         \n   \n   \nIn a strike against Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop computer\nsoftware, Sun Microsystems Inc. yesterday confirmed plans to offer\nword processing and spreadsheet software applications for free over\nthe Internet.\n","\n   Sun, the Palo Alto firm which makes computer workstations,\nnetwork servers and software, said yesterday it had purchased Star\nDivision Corp., a small Fremont company that produces office\nproductivity software that can be accessed over the Net with a\nstandard Web browser.
