Aiello of the Joslin Diabetes Center\nin Boston.\n\n   The findings were in the first phase of safety trials for\nLY333531, a drug developed by Joslin researchers along with\nscientists at Eli Lilly and Co., which already has set up the\nsecond phase of tests.\n\n   The treatment of diabetes, which affects about 16 million people\nin the United States, suffers from lack of effective ways to\nprevent the serious and sometimes deadly complications of the\ndisease, although strict control of diabetics' blood sugar can\nhelp.\n\n   Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness, causing 12,000\nto 24,000 new cases annually.\n\n   In 1996, Joslin researchers reported in the journal Science that\nLY333531, when given to diabetic rats, reversed the kind of\nblood-vessel changes that lead to blindness and kidney damage, two\nof the most serious complications.\n\n   No studies have shown that treatment with the drug will actually\nprevent organ damage, but the scientists are hopeful.\n\n   Aiello, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard\nMedical School, headed the study that he reported Friday at a\nresearch symposium marking the centennial of the Joslin center.\n\n   He said that 21 diabetics were given the drug for a month, in\nvarying doses, while six other patients received a placebo. All of\nthe subjects had experienced potentially harmful changes in the\nblood flow in their eyes.\n\n   One abnormality among the diabetics was a slowing of blood flow\nthrough the fine vessels of the eye, which scientists believe is\ndue to a thickening or constriction of the vessel walls.\n\n   In addition, the patients showed signs of blood leakage from the\nvessels that line the retina. The scientists measured this by\ninjecting a fluorescent dye into the bloodstream that could be\ndetected by scanning the back of the eye.\n\n   Previous research has linked these abnormalities to excessive\nglucose, a form of sugar, in the bloodstream, which is a hallmark\nof diabetes. How glucose damages the eye isn't entirely known. But\nJoslin researchers have shown that as blood glucose rises, so does\nthe activity of a substance called protein kinase C beta that may\ntrigger the blood-vessel changes. The drug LY333531 protects the\nvessels by blocking protein kinase C beta.\n\n   The main purpose of the month-long trial was to look for adverse\neffects of LY333531, and none were found at any of the different\ndoses, said Aiello, though one patient had a ``nonserious'' and\ntemporary drop in white blood cells.\n\n   Encouragingly, he said, the patients that received the drug\nexperienced a significant increase in circulation through the eyes\nand a significant decrease in leakage from the retinal vessels.\n\n   Whether these improvements in circulation will prevent or reduce\nvision loss won't be known until patients have taken the drug for\nseveral years.\n\n   In another report at the Joslin conference, researchers also\nsaid that LY333531, when given in combination with Vitamin E to\ndiabetic rats, improved blood flow to nerves. Nerve damage caused\nby impaired circulation is another common complication of diabetes.\n","Headline":"\nDRUG TO HELP DIABETICS RETAIN SIGHT SAILS THROUGH TESTS\n","Text":["\n   A drug that might help prevent complications from diabetes that\ncause blindness has sailed through its first safety tests on\nhumans, researchers said Friday.\n","\n   The results ``support going on with the larger trials to look at\nwhether this drug will prevent or reduce visual loss'' caused by\nthe disease, said Dr. Lloyd P.
