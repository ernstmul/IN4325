No one stared back. She was terrified.\n\n   ``I couldn't see my face, and that scared the devil out of me,''\nLewis said. ``I have grandchildren, and I love pretty things, and I\njust can't ever lose my vision. I'd rather lose anything except my\neyes.''\n\n   Like Pauline Bailey, 84, of Burleson, Texas, Lewis, who lives in\nFort Worth, drives a car, watches television, reads the paper and\nsays she does everything for herself.\n\n   Bailey said her vision is the key to her existence.\n\n   ``I live alone and drive myself wherever I need to go. My vision\nis everything to me. I can't imagine not having it,'' Bailey said.\nTwo years ago she began using drops for glaucoma, but there was\nnothing she could do then for the bleeding behind her left retina.\n\n   Both women recently participated in a study of light-activated\nVisudyne, the first-ever drug treatment to slow vision loss from\nthe most aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration.\n\n   Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of\nblindness in Americans over 60, affecting an estimated 200,000\npeople each year. A disorder of the macula, an area of tissue near\nthe center of the retina, age-related macular degeneration affects\nthe center of the field of vision, making objects appear dark or\nout of focus.\n\n   Previously, a laser treatment has been available for a limited\nnumber of patients whose macular degeneration has not progressed\nvery far, but it carries a strong risk of burning away the center\nof the retina entirely.\n\n   The new photodynamic therapy involves injecting the drug,\nVisudyne, into the patient's arm by IV, waiting a few minutes for\nthe drug to reach the blood vessels of the eye, and then shining a\nlow-power laser light into the patient's eye for 83 seconds to\ndestroy the abnormal vessels and scar tissue without damaging the\nretina, said Dr. Gary Cowan, an ophthalmologist with Retina\nConsultants of Fort Worth, who directed the study here.\n\n   The cool, red-light laser activates the drug.\n\n   The new treatment is now FDA approved for what's known as the\nwet form of macular degeneration, which occurs when tiny blood\nvessels break through a membrane behind the retina and leak blood\nand fluid, causing increasing loss of central vision. There is\nstill no treatment for the dry form, which is caused by scar tissue\nbuilding up over the center of the retina.\n\n   Age-related macular degeneration ``robs people of the central\nvision needed to read, drive and recognize faces,'' Cowan said.\n``If you can't stop it, most will lose reading vision in one or\nboth eyes, and will be unable to drive. You can find the doorway\nand avoid furniture _ you can do a lot with peripheral vision _ but\n(macular degeneration) is a serious blow to independence. You need\nto be able to pull a can from the cupboard and know whether it's\nbeets or corn without opening it.\n\n   ``I have a lot of patients in pretty good health develop this.\nThey may have to go to an assisted-living facility because they\ncan't prepare their own meals, and they were very independent\nbefore.''\n\n   Approval of the new drug was based on a major study involving 22\nmedical centers, including the University of Texas Southwestern\nMedical Center at Dallas.\n\n   The new therapy is not a cure, FDA officials caution. While it\ncan slow retinal damage, it cannot stop vision loss or restore\nvision in eyes damaged by age-related macular degeneration, but\npatients who take the drug are more likely to have stable vision\nafter a year than those who do not receive the drug.\n\n   The therapy costs about $2,000 per treatment, according to a\nspokeswoman for one of its developers, CIBA Vision, a unit of\nNovartis AG. The cost is covered by Medicare. Patients in the\nstudies cited by the FDA received three or four treatments during\nthe first year. Other studies cited by CIBA Vision suggest that\npatients may need only two treatments per year thereafter.\n\n   ``I don't see any better, but it's not any worse, and I hope\nwith this treatment it won't get any worse,'' said Bailey, who has\nworn glasses for about 60 years. She began developing glaucoma and\nmacular degeneration two years ago.\n\n   Lewis said she was a little afraid of the treatment but that it\nwas completely painless, and she believes her vision is a little\nbetter in the affected eye.\n\n   ``And, with my good eye, I can still get on the computer, and I\nread and see movies,'' Lewis said. ``If it just stays like it is\nright now, I'll be satisfied the rest of my life. The main thing is\nthat it not progress anymore. If it starts leaking again or the\nother eye starts, I'm ready to have the Visudyne again.''\n\n   (Carolyn Poirot writes on health issues for the Fort Worth\nStar-Telegram.
