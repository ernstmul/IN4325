Go out in the\nsun,''' Katzen says.\n\n   And so she did. All summer long she frolicked sunscreen-free on\nthe Jersey shore. In high school, she used a reflector to intensify\nthe sun's rays. In her 20s, she and her husband sailed from Maine\nto South America, and she passed much of those 18 months basting on\ndeck.\n\n   ``Certainly I was not cognizant of the damage the sun could do\nto my skin,'' Katzen says.\n\n   By the age of 28, Katzen had her first skin cancer, on her left\nforearm. Over the past 22 years, the Lantana registered nurse has\nhad more than 50 basal and squamous cell cancers removed from her\nface, neck, arms, legs and back, leaving behind a landscape of\nscars.\n\n   She now checks in with her dermatologist every three months and\nroutinely wears long sleeves and long pants. If she has to spend\nextended time in the sun, she'll don Solumbra clothing, which\nprotects skin from ultraviolet rays.\n\n   And she vacations in Seattle, Denmark and Sweden _ ``places\nwhere it's cold and wet,'' she says.\n\n   But every day, whether cloudy or sun-drenched, she longs for a\ntan. ``I was an addict, so I still think that way.''\n\n   Florida: A melanoma capital\n\n   Such is the long reach and firm grasp of the sun.\n\n   Roughly 1 million Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each\nyear, making it the most common type of cancer in the United\nStates. It's estimated that almost half of Americans who live to\nthe age of 65 will have skin cancer at least once.\n\n   The overwhelming majority of those cancers will be the highly\ncurable basal cell or squamous cell varieties. Basal cell\ncarcinoma, a slow-growing cancer, seldom spreads to other parts of\nthe body. Squamous cell carcinoma also rarely spreads, but it does\nso more often than basal.\n\n   What worries dermatologists most are melanomas, the most deadly\nof skin cancers. Of the estimated 9,200 deaths from skin cancer\nthis year, 7,300 will be from melanoma.\n\n   Cases of melanoma are at an all-time high, and the American\nCancer Society predicts that 44,200 people will be diagnosed with\nmelanoma this year.\n\n   In Florida, an estimated 3,000 new cases of melanoma will be\ndiagnosed this year, placing the Sunshine State second in the\nnation, between first-place California and Texas.\n\n   From 1950 to 1990, the national melanoma rate doubled. ``It's a\nserious epidemic,'' says Ira Schlesinger, a dermatologist in Delray\nBeach. ``With melanoma, all bets are off. It doesn't behave in any\npredictable fashion.''\n\n   Malignant melanoma can spread to other parts of the body very\nquickly, but if detected in its earliest stages and treated\nproperly, it's also highly cureable.\n\n   While it's not clear why the melanoma rate has exploded, factors\ninclude the depletion of the ozone layer _ which in a perfect world\nwould help protect us from ultraviolet radiation _ and the\ntime-delayed effects of a nation in love with the sun.\n\n   ``Any form of burning or tanning is a sign of sun damage,'' says\nSchlesinger, who adds that 90 percent of our sun exposure occurs\nbefore the age of 18, and incidentally.\n\n   And the damage is more than epidermis-deep.\n\n   When the sun's ultraviolet rays burn the skin, they alter the\nDNA in skin cells, prohibiting the DNA from multiplying and\ndividing in the proper manner. That opens the door to cancer.\n\n   Sun exposure also breaks down the skin's collagen and elastin\n(say hello to wrinkles), stimulates pigmentation (greetings,\nfreckles and moles) and dilates blood vessels (welcome, visible\ncapillaries).\n\n   When tanned meant traveled\n\n   To understand the origins of sun worship in this country, you\nhave to rewind the sundial many moons.\n\n   Feeling flush with victory and prosperity, post-World War II\nAmerica tilted its collective face heavenward and basked in an\nunprecedented age of leisure time, interstate travel and trips to\nFlorida beaches.\n\n   A tan line _ once the mark of farmers, ranchers and others who\ntoiled outdoors _ became the coveted accessory of the heretofore\npallid middle and upper classes.\n\n   ``If you had a tan, that showed that you had money to travel,''\nSchlesinger says. ``Having a tan was seen as affluent.''\n\n   But that affluence came at a price, a bill that did not come due\nfor decades. Fifty years later, a nation is tanned, rested and\nready ... for skin cancer.\n\n   Joan Fread, 69, belonged to that initial generation of sun\nworshipers.\n\n   Back in the '40s, Fread and her sister would trudge four miles\nfrom their home in Middletown, N.J., catch a bus and then walk\nanother mile to reach the beach.\n\n   There, the teen-agers donned matching swimsuits, slathered\nthemselves in baby oil and spent up to eight hours a day outdoors.\n``We did an awful lot of laying out on the blanket in the sun,''\nsays Fread, a retired schoolteacher in West Palm Beach. ``We had a\nball.''\n\n   Fread's skin would burn just a little, but then everywhere the\nsun touched turned to gold. ``I used to have a beautiful tan when I\nwas young.''\n\n   Now Fread avoids the beach but makes regular trips to her\ndermatologist's office. She's had a couple dozen pre-cancerous and\ncancerous lesions removed from her face, arms and back.\nFortunately, they've all been nonmelanoma.\n\n   Because of the high incidence of cancer in her immediate family,\nFread remains ever-vigilant. She visits her dermatologist every few\nmonths for screenings.\n\n   Good call, says her dermatologist, Donna Ann Zeide.\n\n   ``That's the name of the game: To get it nice and early,'' Zeide\nsays. ``Why should it have to come to half a nose in a gauze pad?''\n\n   Who's still going for the burn?\n\n   ``Once you're a candidate for this and it's chronic, there's\nnothing you can do to stop it,'' says Cathy Kollman.\n\n   Kollman speaks from ongoing experience. Within the last month,\nshe had her latest in a series of surgeries to remove basal and\nsquamous cell skin cancers.\n\n   Kollman, 50, cut high school to go to the beach and previously\nvacationed in Puerto Rico and Antigua. ``Every place I went was\nalways for the sun,'' she says. ``I've been paying for it ever\nsince.''\n\n   After her first cancer was removed from her back in her early\n20s, she says her reaction was ```Oh, how am I going to go back in\nthe sun?'''\n\n   It took a few more years and few more cancers for the\nseriousness of the disease to sink in. Now, she never goes without\nsunscreen and hat when she walks her two golden retrievers on the\nbeach.\n\n   Miami dermatologist Fredric Brandt says the crystal blue\npersuasion of Florida's beaches makes reaching his patients with an\nanti-tan message that much harder.\n\n   ``You go to the beach on any weekend, and you'll see it packed\nwith people sunbathing,'' he says.\n\n   Indeed, the bikinied and Speedoed resistance recruits young\nadults more than any other group, dermatologists say. (Among 25- to\n29-year-olds, melanoma is more common than any non-skin cancer.)\n\n   Sun damage is cumulative, and the exposure you get now often\nwon't show up for decades. ``When we're young, we all think we're\ninvincible,'' Zeide says. ``It's hard to be good now for five, 10,\n20 years from now.''\n\n   At noon on a recent Sunday, 22-year-old Ana Maia hit Riviera\nBeach armed only with an SPF of 6.\n\n   ``It's low, but I know the risks,'' said the West Palm Beach\nbank teller. On her twice-monthly trips to the beach, she'll\noccasionally leave the sunscreen at home. ``It's dangerous, but\nsometimes you have those lazy times where you don't feel like\nputting anything on.''\n\n   The thought of melanoma scares her, she says, but ``you never\nknow what life is going to bring and you want to enjoy yourself.''\nFor Maia, that means sun, surf and a little color on her normally\npale skin. ``You listen to all these doctors, and there's something\nwrong with everything,'' says 46-year-old Ed Martin, sunning\nSPF-less on Riviera Beach.\n\n   Back in Florida after working eight years as a mechanical\nengineer in St. Croix, where he shrugged off sunscreen despite the\nequatorial rays, Martin grew up on a South Carolina farm. His\nparents and grandparents toiled all summer in the fields without\nsun protection; SPF factors aren't a part of his heritage.\n\n   Wrinkles? Skin cancer? ``When you get to be a certain age,\nyou're going to get those anyway,'' Martin says.\n\n   Clelio Saldana, a 47-year-old heavy equipment operator, also\nfollows a live-and-let-fry philosophy. ``When God says it's your\nturn to go, you go.''\n\n   In the middle of a coastal tour from Key West to Charleston,\nS.C., Clelio and his wife, Nancy, caught some Riviera Beach rays.\nNaturally dark-skinned Clelio wasn't wearing any sunscreen, but the\nfair Nancy used Coppertone 30 on her face and shoulders, and\nAustralia Gold Tanning Accelerator everywhere else.\n\n   ``And I'm going to burn like a lobster,'' said the nurse's\nassistant, 31.\n\n   Several blankets away, Randy Eichholz spreads on a tanning oil\nwith a single-digit SPF.\n\n   A 30-year-old social worker from St. Louis, Eichholz is in hot\npursuit of a Florida tan. ``That way I can make all my employees\njealous.''\n\n   But the tide may slowly be turning on the ability of tanned skin\nto make people green with envy.\n\n   Hollywood, Madison Avenue and the fashion industry, which\npreviously set the golden-glow standard with the likes of Raquel\nWelch, that memorably bronzed Bain de Soleil model and Christie\nBrinkley, are casting the spotlight on whiter shades of pale.\n\n   Many modern mannequins, musicians and actresses exemplify the\nalabaster look: Nicole Kidman, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jewel,\nCate Blanchett and Christina Ricci, to name a fair few.\n\n   ``Hopefully that will help all of us,'' says former sun\nworshiper Katzen. ``Pale can be absolutely beautiful.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Jane Katzen was a child, a tan\nsignified health.\n","\n   ``My parents would tell me, `You look pale.
