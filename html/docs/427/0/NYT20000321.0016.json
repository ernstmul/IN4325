The\nincision- free procedure took 15 minutes and is not expected to\nimpair Watson's vision for Thursday's Sweet 16 game against Iowa\nState.\n\n   ``There is a great spectrum of retinal detachments, and this was\nmild,'' said Dr. Steven D.

Earl's injury is a lot different.''\n\n   It turned out to be the most important injury of Watson's\ncareer.\n\n   Watson was elbowed in the left eye by Maryland guard Steve Blake\nthree minutes into the game _ just before the celebrated sequence\nin which Watson blocked Blake's layup at one end, then tossed an\nalley-oop pass to Jerome Moiso for a dunk at the other.\n\n   Watson left the game for three minutes as UCLA's trainers\nstopped the bleeding. He played the game of his life (17 points, a\nschool-record 16 assists and no turnovers) and then received four\nstitches in his eyelid.\n\n   When Watson awoke Monday, his eye was throbbing and almost\nswollen shut. Coach Steve Lavin sent him to the Stein Institute for\na checkup, and that's when a small amount of retinal fluid _\nsignaling a detachment _ was discovered.\n\n   During the procedure, called a laser retinopexy, Schwartz sent a\nlaser beam through Watson's pupil to the back of the eye. The laser\n``tacks the retina down,'' Schwartz said, which seals the\ndetachment.\n\n   ``I think he had (the detachment) for quite a long time, and it\njust happened to be discovered today,'' Schwartz said. ``For that\nreason, we were lucky to catch it.''\n\n   If Watson hadn't gone for the checkup, the detached retina\nwouldn't have been discovered until preseason medical exams next\nfall, Schwartz said. By then, the detachment could have become\nserious.\n\n   Watson did not practice Monday.\n\n   NOTES: The Bruins will depart Los Angeles this morning for\nDetroit.
