Times News Service   \n\n   The Food and Drug Administration recently issued new regulations\nfor labeling, testing and manufacturing sun protection products.\nThe rules do away with terms like ``sun block,'' ``waterproof'' and\n``all-day protection.'' All over-the-counter sun protection\nproducts will be called ``sunscreen.'' Those that resist water will\nbe classified either as ``water resistant'' or ``very water\nresistant'' on product packaging.\n\n   The federal agency also approved a list of active ingredients\nfor over-the-counter sunscreens. In order to be considered\n``active,'' ingredients have to ``absorb, reflect or scatter\nradiation in the UV range at wavelengths of 290 to 400\nnanometers.'' UVB rays, which induce sunburn and skin cancer, fall\ninto the 290 to 320 nanometer range, while UVA rays, which affect\naging and cause skin cancer, range from 320 to 400. Some of the\nsunscreen-approved ingredients that the agency listed were zinc\noxide, titanium dioxide, dioxybenzone and avobenzone. There were 18\nin all.\n\n   The agency also announced a new rating system in which sunscreen\nproducts would be ranked as ``minimum,'' ``moderate'' or ``high.''\nHigh includes any products with an SPF, or sun protection factor,\nof 30 or greater, moderate is 12 to 29 and minimum is 2 to 11. SPF\nratings are calculated by comparing the amount of time needed to\nproduce a sunburn on protected skin to the amount of time needed\nfor unprotected skin to burn. In other words, people wearing\nsunscreen rated SPF 15, would take 15 times longer to burn      than\nthey would if they were not wearing sunscreen.\n\n   The American Academy of Dermatology takes issue with some\naspects of the new guidelines. Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, president of\nthe academy, believes it is misleading to lump all products with\nSPF ratings of 30 or greater into one category. In the past,\nsunscreen products have been labeled as high as 60 in this country.\n\n   ``Recent studies have indicated that people tend to underapply\nsunscreen and only get 20 to 50 percent of the rated SPF,'' Rigel\nsaid. ``If you're using a 30 the way studies have shown the average\nperson uses it, you're only getting a 6 to 15, and that may not be\nsufficient. Besides, if you cap what manufacturers can claim is the\nhighest SPF, there will be no incentive to make a better\nsunscreen.''\n\n   The agency counters that there are not adequate test measures to\ngauge the safety and effectiveness of products with SPF's of more\nthan 30.\n\n   This year, more than one million new cases of skin cancer will\nbe diagnosed, and the most serious form, malignant melanoma, will\nclaim 9,200 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\n\n   ``I see the effects of when people don't protect themselves from\nthe sun like they should,'' Rigel said. ``It is frustrating because\nwe know that if they protect themselves from the sun their chance\nof getting skin cancer drops dramatically.''\n","Headline":"\nIN TIME FOR THE BEACH, NEW SUNSCREEN RULES \n","Text":["\n   The Food and Drug Administration recently issued new regulations\nfor labeling, testing and manufacturing sun protection products.\nThe rules do away with terms like ``sun block,'' ``waterproof'' and\n``all-day protection.''
