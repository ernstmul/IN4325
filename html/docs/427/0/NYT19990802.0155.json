In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin\nand lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind\nof arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts\nin young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the\njoints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to\nbone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.\n\n   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do\nexercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the\njoints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving\nforward severely.\n\n   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist\nspotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing\nspondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter\nthe deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing\nwell. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.\n\n   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact\nthrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and\nmaking the forward curve in his spine much worse.\n\n   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of\nMinnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic\nsurgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at\nthe base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could\nswing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal\nsolidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position\nfor two or three months.\n\n   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next\nmorning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in\nplace after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the\nhead just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.\n\n   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his\nforehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated\nbut alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.\n\n   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of\nthe scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone\nuntil the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord\ncould be seen.\n\n   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting\ninstrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage\nnerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.\n\n   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that\nenough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped\nLeonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled\nmurmur of protest were heard from under the drape.\n\n   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist\nasked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,\ndressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician\nthen slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and\nattached the halo to it with bars and clamps.\n\n   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and\nankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All\nappeared to be in order.\n\n   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,\nwhen one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's\nbeen something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.\n\n   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes\nand looked at me.\n\n   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is\nyour vision blurred?'' I asked.\n\n   ``I don't think so,'' he said.\n\n   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.\n\n   ``Your what?'' he responded.\n\n   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.\n\n   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and\na neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The\nproblem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that\nprocesses input from the eyes had been injured.\n\n   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what\nhe was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which\nlies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?\n\n   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain\ncirculation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.\n\n   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,\nshowed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the\nvessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably\nsqueezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and\nnutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?\n\n   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding\na patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply\nof oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing\ninflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early\ntreatment of brain injury.\n\n   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides\nhigher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat\ndecompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there\ndirected research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,\nincluding stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended\nthat we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100\npercent oxygen.\n\n   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen\ntreatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His\nvision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was\ndischarged a few days later, his vision was normal.\n\n   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed\nnicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.\n\n   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added\nsupport, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further\nprotection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former\nactivities. His spine was now in a better position than before the\naccident.\n\n   -----\n\n     (Sharron Sussman is an orthopedic surgeon in Berkeley,\nCaifornia.)     \n\n   -----\n","Headline":"\nNOW HE'S BLIND?  \n     \n","Text":["\n   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was\ncurved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top\nof his head.\n","\n   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to\nthis state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak\nnormally.
