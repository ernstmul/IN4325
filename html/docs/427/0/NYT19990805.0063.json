The Magic wanted Duke's\nCorey Maggette, but the Suns drafted Nevada-Las Vegas' Shawn Marion\n_ who wasn't on the Orlando list _ because no trade was guaranteed.\n\n   The Magic later traded Horace Grant to Seattle in a deal that\nincluded Maggette.\n\n   The Suns, meanwhile, held fast to their offer of Manning,\nGarrity and draft picks _ despite continuing inaccurate reports\nthat forward Tom Gugliotta would be included.\n\n   The Suns were so insistent that Gugliotta would not be part of a\ndeal that General Manager Bryan Colangelo asked Gabriel to contact\nGugliotta's agent and assure him that Gugliotta was not being\ndiscussed.
