The program teaches children about sunscreen, use of proper\nclothing, and limiting exposure to the sun at the times when it is\nstrongest, Rutsch said.\n\n   ``The SunWise program is designed to provide maximum\nflexibility, because the program can be used as stand-alone\nteaching tools or to complement existing school curricula,'' Rutsch\nsaid. ``The time commitment necessary to implement SunWise is\nminimal, but the potential payoff in lower skin cancer rates is\nvery high.''\n\n   The program also includes information about sun exposure through\nthe EPA's Web site, and allows students to study daily measurements\nof ultraviolet radiation, Rutsch said.\n\n   ``Through the site, the students can study daily UV data,\nweather conditions, and daily sun-protection practices,'' Rutsch\nsaid. ``The students can study the UV index on the National Weather\nService's Web site, and measure the amount of UV by using hand-held\nmonitoring devices that are loaned to the schools by the SunWise\nprogram.''\n\n   More than 200 schools are participating in the SunWise program\nnationwide. Schools, individual classrooms or entire school\ndistricts can register either on line or by sending a registration\nform to the EPA.\n\n   On the Web: www.epa.gov/sunwise\n\n   Rob O'Dell's e-mail address is rodell(at)coxnews.com\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ The federal government and local schools are\nteaming up to teach children about the dangers of sun exposure.\n","\n   The SunWise program, offered by the Environmental Protection\nAgency, is designed to provide schools a free and easy way to teach\nchildren how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun and\nhow to develop sun-safe behaviors, said Linda Rutsch, the program's\nschools coordinator.\n","\n   ``In the long run, the SunWise program hopes to reduce instances\nof skin cancer, but for now we want to educate children about the\nharmful effects of the sun,'' Rutsch said. ``Because the majority\nof a person's exposure to the sun occurs during youth, now it is a\ncritical time to get the message to young people.''\n","\n   Dr. Joel Wilentz, a dermatologist from Hallandale, Fla., said\nalthough adults are often warned about the dangers of the sun,\nchildren are often allowed to play in the sun unprotected.\n","\n   ``The skin never forgets it exposure to the sun,'' Wilentz said.\n``One bad sunburn during childhood doubles the chance of getting\nskin cancer later in life.''\n","\n   It is estimated that 80 percent of a person's lifetime exposure\nto the sun occurs before the age of 18, he said.\n","\n   The SunWise program provides its partner schools with classroom\nlessons and background information for kindergarten through eighth\ngrade.
