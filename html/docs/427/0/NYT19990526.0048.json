Only about half say they regularly use\na sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or higher and\na quarter say they use no sunscreen.\n\n   Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers and one out of\nevery five people in the United States develops it during his or\nher lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n   Skin cancer, bump, spot and wrinkle development differ with each\nperson, Mason said.\n\n   ``The amount of sun it takes to cause skin cancer is\ncumulative,'' he said. ``Two hours here, 20 minutes there, 15\nminutes there. It all adds up.''\n\n   People with light complexions, fair hair and light-colored eyes\nare more at risk for skin cancer. However, darker-skinned people\nalso can develop skin cancers, including malignant melanoma.\n\n   Melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer, can look like\nmoles with irregular coloration in shades of black, brown, white or\nblue, and have ragged, uneven borders. If detected early, it can\noften be treated successfully. If not treated, it can spread to\nother organs and result in death.\n\n   Non-melanoma skin cancers may look like pearly, flesh-colored\nbumps or scaly bumps.\n\n   Any change in a preexisting mole, birthmark or beauty mark is an\nindication of skin cancer. Look for changes in color and increases\nin size or thickness or texture.\n\n   The American Cancer Society suggests conducting self-exams of\nthe skin every one to three months to check for suspicious-looking\nmoles or funny-shaped dark spots that increase in size. Any skin\nproblem should be checked out immediately with a dermatologist.\n\n   Here are more tips on reducing the chances of getting skin\ncancer:\n\n   _ Wear protective clothing, like tightly woven shirts with long\nsleeves, wide-brimmed hats or bonnets and sunglasses, Mason\nsuggested.\n\n   _ Avoid spending too much time outdoors from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. _\nthe peak time of day when maximum sun damage occurs. If your shadow\nis shorter than you are, you're more likely to sunburn.\n\n   _ Look for sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or\nhigher. The higher the number, the longer the protection will last.\nLook for waterproof and sweatproof sunscreens. For hassle-free\nprotection all day long, slather on sunscreen in the morning and\nreapply using a new spray-on formula. To help make the chore fun\nfor kids there are new colored lotions that look purple, blue and\ngreen but disappear when rubbed in.\n\n   _ Coat children frequently with sunscreen and keep children\nyounger than six months out of direct sunlight.\n\n   _ Wear sunscreen even if you're sitting in the shade. Even if\nthe sun is blocked from overhead, rays can reflect off water, sand\nand concrete. You can also sunburn on an overcast day because up to\n80 percent of the sun's rays can penetrate clouds. According to\nCoppertone Solar Research Center, these rays can account for 80\npercent of a lifetime exposure.\n\n   Christi Mays writes for The Waco Tribune-Herald, Waco, Texas.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WACO, Texas _ Soaking up the hot rays of the summer sun without\nprotection is like giving skin cancer an open invitation to form on\nyour skin.\n","\n   ``People are still thinking a tan is beautiful and the sun and\ntanning beds are safe,'' said Dr. James Mason, a dermatologist. ``I\nthink older people are getting the picture when they see the bumps\nand skin spots come up, but younger people feel like they're immune\nto these types of problems and don't think about it until it's too\nlate.''\n","\n   According to surveys from Coppertone Solar Research Center,\nabout nine in 10 people say they are concerned about preventing\nskin cancer and almost all consumers agree that sun exposure is a\nmajor cause of skin cancer and premature aging of the skin.\nHowever, only 36 percent of the population say they use sunscreens\nmore often than in the past.
