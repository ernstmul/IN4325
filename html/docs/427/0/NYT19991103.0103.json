What\nmy eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm\nseeing can be two very different things.\n\n   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively\ncreate what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past\nexperiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when\nwe do it can come as a surprise.\n\n   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,\nyou'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.\n\n   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference\nbetween seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see\naccompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist\nVilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on\nthe left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.\n\n   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and\nthe spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,\nexcept flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is\nabove _ like the sun.\n\n   Now stare at the circles while telling yourself that the light\ncomes from below: The images will reverse themselves.\n\n   Try are two other experiments:\n\n     EXPERIMENT 1:     \n\n   1. Extreme _ yet unconscious _ cases of active perception occur\nall the time, because the brain continually adjusts for our\nmovement and that of what we are looking at.\n\n   To see this, hold your left hand in front of you, thumb sticking\nup, and move it back and forth horizontally. Watch your thumb. Now\nhold your thumb still and scan your eyes quickly back and forth.\n\n   In both cases, the image of your thumb moves across your\nretinas, but only in the first case do you perceive movement.\n\n   The perception of motion doesn't necessarily arise from an image\nmoving across your retina, as you might expect. Instead, it is\ncontrolled by the brain. When the brain knows the eyes are moving,\nit nullifies the resulting shift in background to prevent you from\nthinking that your environment is moving.\n\n     EXPERIMENT 2:     \n\n   2. To throw this tidy arrangement into chaos, disrupt the\ncommunication between the brain and the eyes. Very gently nudge one\neye as you read this. The text should lurch in the opposite\ndirection of the nudge.\n\n   Your brain didn't command your eye to move in such a way, so it\ncouldn't compensate for the nudge. When it saw motion on your\nretina, it wrongly assumed the world had shifted.\n\n     SIDEBAR: EYES WIDE SHUT     \n\n   Active perception can also work against us, giving too much\ncredence to what we expect and not enough to what we actually\nwitness.\n\n   For example, one study showed that women forgave attractive\nchildren more quickly than unattractive ones, even for identical\ntransgressions. Most of us expect good-looking kids to be better\nadjusted than homely ones.\n\n   So the next time you find yourself dismissing something new\nbecause it doesn't fit with your experiences, give your eye a very\ngentle nudge. When the room jumps, remember that we actively\nconstruct our perceptions.\n\n   -----\n\n   (Eric Haseltine is a contributing editor to Discover magazine.)\n","Headline":"\nHOW THE BRAIN WORKS  \n     \n","Text":["\n   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.''
