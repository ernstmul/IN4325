UV levels that winter were 15 to 20 percent higher\nthan in the late 1970s, when research measurements first began soon\nafter the ``ozone hole'' was discovered spreading outward in the\nupper atmosphere from Antarctica.\n\n   The report in Science, which came from a New Zealand team led by\natmospheric physicist Richard McKenzie, ``provides the strongest\nevidence yet that a degraded atmospheric ozone layer causes more\nhazardous conditions for life on the planet's surface,'' according\nto a research news article in the same journal.\n","Headline":"\nRISE IN DAMAGING UV RADIATION LINKED DIRECTLY TO OZONE DEPLETION\n","Text":["\n   Levels of the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation that burns\nthe skin of beachgoers and disrupts the DNA of plants and animals\nhave increased dangerously over the past decade, scientists have\nfound.\n","\n   And for the first time, their measurements link the increases\ndirectly to the long-noted annual decline in the Earth's protective\nlayers of ozone as high as the upper stratosphere.\n","\n   The ``ozone hole'' phenomenon was first discovered 25 years ago\nabove Antarctica and New Zealand, and has since been confirmed over\nwide areas of the Northern Hemisphere as well in a series of\nmeasurements by balloon-borne instruments, high-flying NASA\naircraft and satellite observations.\n","\n   The alarming decrease in atmospheric ozone _ largely caused by\nworldwide pollution in the upper atmosphere from chemicals called\nchlorofluorocarbons _ led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol in which\nmore than 140 nations have agreed to ban those chemicals by the end\nof this century.\n","\n   The U.S. banned their production in 1996.\n","\n   Ozone is itself a toxic gas, but in the Earth's upper\natmosphere, in regions ranging from 10 to 25 miles high, ozone acts\nas a shield against the dangerous frequencies of ultraviolet\nradiation known as UV-B.\n","\n   Despite the best of sunblock ointments and skin creams, UV-B, in\nturn, can cause blistering sunburns that lead to skin cancers; it\ncan cause damaging cataracts in human eyes, and disrupt long\nsequences of DNA in bacteria and algae that are particularly vital\nto the ecological health of marine life.\n","\n   But until now there has been no firm evidence linking the\ndepletion of ozone to increases in UV-B radiation reaching the\nEarth.\n","\n   In an article published Friday in the journal Science, however,\nscientists from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and\nAtmospheric Research report that over the past 10 years peak levels\nof sunburning UV radiation reaching their monitoring instruments\nhave increased by 12 percent _ a finding that correlates\nsignificantly with the annual losses of ozone in the atmosphere\nabove New Zealand.\n","\n   During the southern nation's summer of 1998-99 (winter here in\nthe Northern Hemisphere) peak levels of the skin-burning,\nDNA-damaging UV radiation were the highest ever measured, the\nscientists say.
