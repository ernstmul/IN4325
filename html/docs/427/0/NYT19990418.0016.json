Times News Service clients)  \n By BOB YOUNG  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Nov. 8, 1992    \nSan Diego _ Newly acquired forward Charles Barkley scored 32 points\nand grabbed 16 rebounds as the San Diego Suns made their debut at\nthe sparkling new Southwest Airlines Center by beating the\n\n   Los Angeles Clippers, 111-105. ...\n\n   Phoenix _ City Council members discussed the growing transient\nproblem in Phoenix's downtown, particularly in the abandoned\nwarehouse district near Third Street and Jefferson.   \n   \nWe'll never know if that's the way it would have turned out.\n\n   But there is little doubt that the Phoenix sports landscape\ndramatically changed when the Suns signed Tom Chambers to the first\nunrestricted free-agent contract in NBA history on July 5, 1988.\n\n   It was the final piece in a dramatic overhaul of the franchise\nthat began in the wake of a 1987 drug scandal, when Jerry Colangelo\nput together a group to purchase the Suns and hired Cotton\nFitzsimmons as player personnel director.\n\n   Fitzsimmons engineered a trade that would bring point guard\nKevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers and a draft pick the\nSuns would use to take Dan Majerle.\n\n   Colangelo named Fitzsimmons head coach, and the club signed\nChambers, one of the league's most feared scorers, to pair with\nJohnson, the lightning-quick playmaker.\n\n   A franchise was reborn.\n\n   The club will honor Chambers, a special assistant to Coach Danny\nAinge, at halftime today of the Suns-Seattle game at America West\nArena _ a building that might never have been erected if Chambers\nhadn't arrived.\n\n   Chambers, a 6-foot-10, 225-pound forward who could shoot with\nrange, score inside, run the floor like a guard and finish at the\nbasket as well as anyone, will join Connie Hawkins, Dick Van\nArsdale, Alvan Adams, Paul Westphal and Walter Davis on a new\n``Ring of Honor'' along the south rim of the arena's upper tier.\n\n   Fitzsimmons, a senior executive vice president with the club,\nhas photos on his office wall of the handful of players he believes\nare responsible for turning around the franchise and getting the\narena built.\n\n   Chambers and KJ are the two most important links.\n\n   ``Jerry (Colangelo) might dispute this, but if we hadn't turned\nit around and had to stay in the (Veteran's Memorial) Coliseum, we\nmight not have the Phoenix Suns today,'' Fitzsimmons said.\n\n   ``We might not be having this conversation in this building.\nThat's just what I think with the way this (pro sports) business is\nnow.''\n\n   Colangelo always has denied that he was prepared to move the\nSuns if the club didn't get a new arena. And the groundwork was\nbeing laid for an arena before Chambers signed.\n\n   But with Chambers and KJ running Fitzsimmons' beloved two-man,\nscreen-and-roll game on the wings, the Suns made the biggest\nturnaround in NBA history at that point, improving from 28\nvictories in 1987-88 to 55 in 1988-89.\n\n   That club started a playoff streak that is at 10 years and\ncounting, and it reached the Western Conference Finals before\nfalling to the powerful Los Angeles Lakers of Magic Johnson and\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n   Chambers averaged 25.7 points a game and KJ more than 20 points\nand 10 assists. That started a string of four consecutive season of\n50-wins or more. The Suns were fun to watch. Their games were the\nplace to be seen. And it started the momentum toward a new home for\nthe team, which set attendance records at the Coliseum.\n\n   Chambers was the centerpiece.\n\n   ``Tom played a big role in our ability to build the new arena\nand in all of the other things that kind of dominoed from that,''\nColangelo said. ``Tom was an absolute perfect fit at the top of his\ngame.\n\n   ``When he and KJ teamed up, it was a beautiful work of art. We\nowe a great deal of gratitude to Tom. He was a pleasure to watch.''\n\n   Chambers came to Phoenix with a reputation for being aloof and\nfor having a nasty temperament on the court.\n\n   He once punched out teammate Tim Perry, and during a comeback\nattempt last season he got into an altercation with the team's\nstrength coach, Robin Pound.\n\n   He was criticized in 1993 when, after the Suns moved into the\nnew arena and reached the NBA Finals, he didn't show up for a\nparade.\n\n   Chambers has said he regrets that day, and he has become a\nquieter, more religious man since his playing days ended.\n\n   ``Compared to when he played, he's mellowed 100 percent,''\nFitzsimmons said. ``But I wouldn't have wanted him mellow when he\nwas playing for me. He was fiery, confrontational.\n\n   ``I think it was part of his competitiveness, and that's what\nmade him as successful as he was. He got mad. He got a lot of\ntechnicals. That was fine with me.''\n\n   Colangelo said the team knew Chambers was temperamental when it\nsigned him.\n\n   ``I would say he came with a little bit of a reputation,''\nColangelo said. ``But the fact is, from time he came to Phoenix he\nfelt loved and appreciated. He was a happy guy, and he performed\naccordingly.''\n\n   Chambers asked the Suns to hold the ceremony today so that\nWestphal, now head coach of the Sonics, could be present. Westphal,\nthen a Suns assistant, was the first to call Chambers to tell him\nthe Suns wanted him on their team.\n\n   ``They had a plan,'' Chambers said. ``And they wanted me from\nDay One more than anybody else. I really wanted to start from\nscratch, and be a part of a team that was building itself back\nup.''\n\n   But few imagined how well Chambers and KJ would meld.\n\n   ``I don't know if anybody envisioned that,'' Chambers said. ``I\nknew KJ was going to be an All-Star. The things he could do,\nbreaking people down, passing, hitting the open shot, you could see\nhe would have a great career.\n\n   ``And I knew I wanted to be part of that style of play, running\nup and down, trying to score 120 points a night. It obviously\nplayed to my strengths. I was always a runner.''\n\n   If KJ envisioned it, he isn't saying. He didn't return repeated\nphone calls for comment. Maybe only Fitzsimmons saw the potential\nfor a two-man game that would rival any that have played in the NBA\n_ including John Stockton and Karl Malone of Utah.\n\n   ``You could not possibly defend those two people,'' Suns Coach\nDanny Ainge said of the Chambers-KJ pick-and-roll. ``People don't\ngive Tom enough credit for being one of the most gifted athletes\nwho has ever played in the NBA.\n\n   ``You don't expect a guy who is that big to be able to run, and\njump and shoot and do all the things he could do. He was one of the\ngreatest scorers I've seen.''\n\n   Fitzsimmons, who once coached ``Pistol'' Pete Maravich, agreed.\n\n   ``He was a late bloomer,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``He's tell you he\nwasn't that good in high school or even college. But he became one\nof the great scorers of all time.\n\n   ``If he and KJ had spent their entire careers together, you'd\nstill be talking about Stockton and Malone, but you would be\ntalking about Chambers and Johnson, too.''\n\n   On March 24, 1990, Chambers set the Suns' record for scoring in\na game, chalking up 60 points in a game against the Sonics at the\nColiseum.\n\n   ``If he had been forced into the eighth row of Section 208,\nChambers still would have swished it from there,'' wrote ``The\nArizona'' ``Republic's'' Mark Armijo that night.\n\n   Chambers was around long enough to enjoy the new building he\nhelped build, serving as sixth man during the 1992-93 Finals\nseason. His career wound down after two more seasons in Utah,\nanother in a pro league in Israel and a couple of comeback attempts\nwith Charlotte and the Suns.\n\n   Now 40, Chambers has undertaken another building project:\nPhoenix rookie Pat Garrity and the club's other young players. The\nonce fiery, confrontational temperamental and supremely talented\nforward has become the mentor and tutor.\n\n   ``I love it,'' Chambers said. ``I always thought when I was\nplaying that when I was done, I was done. I didn't imagine myself\ncoaching. I love spending time at the ranch (in Utah) and with my\nfamily. But I'm one of those people that needs to be doing\nsomething.\n\n   ``When you've been around something for 20 years, there are some\nwithdrawals. It's like an addiction. I couldn't be any happier with\nthe way this has all worked out.\n\n   ``I'm just glad I was part of this. A lot of things have\nhappened in this city involving sports. And I love the fact that\nI'm mentioned, along with KJ and our teams, when people talk about\nwhat has evolved. I take a lot of pride in that.''  \n","Headline":"\nTHRIVING SUNS OWE CHAMBERS THANKS  \n 1988 SIGNING PUSHED CLUB TO BIG TIME \n","Text":["\n   Nov. 8, 1992    \nSan Diego _ Newly acquired forward Charles Barkley scored 32 points\nand grabbed 16 rebounds as the San Diego Suns made their debut at\nthe sparkling new Southwest Airlines Center by beating the\n","\n   Los Angeles Clippers, 111-105. ...\n","\n   Phoenix _ City Council members discussed the growing transient\nproblem in Phoenix's downtown, particularly in the abandoned\nwarehouse district near Third Street and Jefferson.   \n   \nWe'll never know if that's the way it would have turned out.\n","\n   But there is little doubt that the Phoenix sports landscape\ndramatically changed when the Suns signed Tom Chambers to the first\nunrestricted free-agent contract in NBA history on July 5, 1988.\n","\n   It was the final piece in a dramatic overhaul of the franchise\nthat began in the wake of a 1987 drug scandal, when Jerry Colangelo\nput together a group to purchase the Suns and hired Cotton\nFitzsimmons as player personnel director.\n","\n   Fitzsimmons engineered a trade that would bring point guard\nKevin Johnson from the Cleveland Cavaliers and a draft pick the\nSuns would use to take Dan Majerle.\n","\n   Colangelo named Fitzsimmons head coach, and the club signed\nChambers, one of the league's most feared scorers, to pair with\nJohnson, the lightning-quick playmaker.\n","\n   A franchise was reborn.\n","\n   The club will honor Chambers, a special assistant to Coach Danny\nAinge, at halftime today of the Suns-Seattle game at America West\nArena _ a building that might never have been erected if Chambers\nhadn't arrived.\n","\n   Chambers, a 6-foot-10, 225-pound forward who could shoot with\nrange, score inside, run the floor like a guard and finish at the\nbasket as well as anyone, will join Connie Hawkins, Dick Van\nArsdale, Alvan Adams, Paul Westphal and Walter Davis on a new\n``Ring of Honor'' along the south rim of the arena's upper tier.\n","\n   Fitzsimmons, a senior executive vice president with the club,\nhas photos on his office wall of the handful of players he believes\nare responsible for turning around the franchise and getting the\narena built.\n","\n   Chambers and KJ are the two most important links.\n","\n   ``Jerry (Colangelo) might dispute this, but if we hadn't turned\nit around and had to stay in the (Veteran's Memorial) Coliseum, we\nmight not have the Phoenix Suns today,'' Fitzsimmons said.\n","\n   ``We might not be having this conversation in this building.\nThat's just what I think with the way this (pro sports) business is\nnow.''\n","\n   Colangelo always has denied that he was prepared to move the\nSuns if the club didn't get a new arena.
