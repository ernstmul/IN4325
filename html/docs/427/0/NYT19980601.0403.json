More than 3 million Americans have\nglaucoma, and 80,000 are blind because of it.\n\n   ``My whole world turned upside down,'' Rafferty says. ``At 41,\nall I could think was that I was too young to go blind.''\n\n   Luckily, her condition was caught early enough to save most of\nher sight. Two surgeries have allowed Rafferty, now 49, to see well\nenough to continue working for a pharmaceutical company in\nBerkeley, Calif.\n\n   The best way to prevent vision loss is to get routine eye exams.\nThese checkups should include a dilation, in which eye drops are\nused to enlarge your pupils, allowing a doctor to see inside your\neyes to check for signs of disease. These screenings are especially\nimportant as you get older.\n\n   In general, you should see an ophthalmologist or optometrist\nevery two to three years until the age of 40. After that, a yearly\nexam is advisable.\n\n   Following are the top causes of vision trouble, and what you can\ndo about them.\n   GLAUCOMA     \n\n   What it is: This eye disease is often called ``the silent thief\nof the night,'' because irreversible vision loss can occur before\nit's diagnosed.\n\n   As the disease gets worse, peripheral vision narrows. Depending\non the type of glaucoma, you may notice eye pain, blurry vision or\nheadaches.\n\n   Who is at risk: People 60 or older, as well as African-Americans\nand those with diabetes, nearsightedness, high blood pressure or a\nfamily history of glaucoma\n\n   What you can do: Get routine eye exams. Vision loss from\nglaucoma can usually be prevented through eye drops, pills and\nconventional or laser surgery.\n\n   Latest news: Preliminary studies suggest that regular aerobic\nexercise, such as biking or brisk walking, may help reduce your\nglaucoma risk.\n   DIABETIC RETINOPATHY     \n\n   What it is: About half of the 16 million Americans who have\ndiabetes suffer from this disorder, and each year more than 24,000\nof them go blind from it.\n\n   Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood-sugar levels cause\ntiny blood vessels to leak in the retina. There may be no initial\nsymptoms, but later there may be blurriness as the retina starts to\nswell. Blood vessels can also bleed into the vitreous humor _ the\nclear, jellylike substance that makes up the center of the eye _\nand cause vision loss.\n\n   Who is at risk: Diabetics and those at risk for diabetes,\nincluding African-Americans, pregnant women, overweight people and\nthose with high blood pressure.\n\n   What you can do: To prevent diabetes, stay slim and exercise. A\nyearly eye dilation can also help detect diabetes at its earliest\nand most treatable stage. If you already have diabetes, monitor\nyour blood sugar carefully. Eat right, exercise and take your\nmedicine _ most cases of blindness from diabetes can be prevented.\n\n   Latest news: To slow vision loss, laser surgery is often used to\nseal off leaking blood vessels. Advanced cases may be helped by a\nvitrectomy, in which a blood-soaked vitreous humor is replaced with\na clear solution.\n   MACULAR DEGENERATION     \n\n   What it is: A progressive eye disorder that affects the macula _\nthe center area of the retina _ causing central vision to become\nblurry or distorted.\n\n   There are two types of age-related macular degeneration: ``dry''\nand ``wet.'' The dry form, which accounts for 90 percent of cases,\noccurs when macular tissue thins as a result of aging. The wet\nform, however, is more serious and can cause sudden vision loss. It\noccurs when new blood vessels grow and leak fluids behind the\nretina, creating blind spots.\n\n   Who is at risk: Anyone over age 65, or who has a family history\nof the disease. Scientists have recently identified a gene that may\naccount for as many as 16 percent of AMD cases. Other possible risk\nfactors include a high-fat diet and smoking.\n\n   What you can do: While there is no cure for AMD, some patients\nwith the wet form benefit from laser surgery to seal off leaking\nblood vessels.\n\n   Latest news: Scientists are looking into whether antioxidant\nsupplements, such as vitamins C, E and bela-carotene, and minerals\nsuch as zinc can slow down the disease. And researchers have\nrecently found that a substance called vascular endothelial growth\nfactor causes new blood vessels to grow in the retina. They hope to\nfind drugs to counter its effects.\n   CATARACT     \n\n   What it is: A condition in which the eye's lens gradually loses\nits clarity. This clouding prevents the lens from bringing light\ninto focus.\n\n   Early on, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But as the\ndisease progresses, vision will get blurry or distorted. You may\nalso become more sensitive to light, and colors may look dull.\n\n   Who is at risk: Everyone will get cataracts if they live long\nenough. In fact, more than half of Americans ages 65 and older have\nsome form of the disorder. While it isn't clear what causes the\ncondition, one recent study found that smoking 20 or more\ncigarettes a day triples your risk of early cataracts.\n\n   What you can do: ``Surgery is the only proven way to treat\ncataracts,'' says Dr. Richard E. Braunstein, assistant clinical\nprofessor of ophthalmology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center\nin New York.\n\n   It's also very effective: More than 90 percent of patients who\nhave the procedure, in which a cloudy lens is replaced by a clear\nartificial one, improve their vision.\n\n   Latest news: Research shows that vitamin C may have a protective\neffect. In one study, women who took as much as 250 milligrams of\nthe supplement a day for 10 years or more experienced 77 percent\nfewer cases of early cataracts.\n\n   Estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may also\ndelay the onset of cataracts.\n   REFRACTIVE DISORDERS     \n\n   What they are: Visual disorders that occur when the lens and\ncornea do not bend light properly. For instance, nearsightedness,\nalso called myopia, makes it difficult to see distant objects.\nFarsightedness, or hyperopia, makes it tough to see close objects.\nAstigmatism occurs when the eye can't focus because its cornea is\nmisshapen.\n\n   Who is at risk: Nearsightedness often hits in grade school, gets\nworse during the teens, then stabilizes until age 40.\nFarsightedness often strikes after 40.\n\n   What you can do: Get glasses or contact lenses. Or consider\nrefractive surgery, in which the cornea is reshaped with a surgical\ninstrument, laser or both. The average cost is about $2,000 per\neye. In radial keratotomy, tiny incisions are made in the cornea to\ncorrect nearsightedness. A similar technique is used in astigmatic\nkeratotomy to treat astigmatism.\n\n   Latest news: Photo-refractive keratectomy surgery _ in which a\nlaser is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness or an\nastigmatism _ has become more popular in the last two years.\nNearsightedness or astigmatism may also be helped by a newer\nprocedure, laser in-situ keratomileusis, done with a surgical\ninstrument and a laser.\n\n   While 75 percent of patients will be able to see without\nglasses, perfect vision is not guaranteed, says Dr. Ernest W.\nKornmehl, a refractive surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear\nInfirmary in Boston. Depending on the procedure, some people may\nbecome more sensitive to the light. In rare cases, vision loss\noccurs.\n\n   But most patients are pleased with the results.\n\n   ``PRK changed my life,'' says former contact-lens wearer Barbara\nMurphy of Mineola, N.Y. ``I forgot how great it is to wake up and\nbe able to see on my own.''\n\n     (Jacqueline Stenson is a New York-based free-lance writer.)   \n   (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not\nprohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative\nCONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or\nby fax at 816-822-1444.)   \n   (She also has information on how to subscribe to LifeBeat, a weekly\npackage of five intriguing articles with color art.)   \n   -------------------------------------------------  \n","Headline":"\nSAFEGUARDING YOUR SIGHT: YOUR EYES AND HOW TO PROTECT THEM \n","Text":["\n   Mary Ann Rafferty didn't know she had eye problems.\n","\n   ``I just wanted a new pair of frames,'' she recalls. ``But when\nthe doctor examined my eyes, I knew by the look on his face that\nsomething was wrong.''\n","\n   A few more tests confirmed that Rafferty had glaucoma, a disease\nin which too much fluid pressure builds up inside the eye and\ndamages the optic nerve.
