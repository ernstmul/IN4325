Times News Service clients)  \n BY BARBARA YOST  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n     \n(GILBERT, Ariz.) - For the first time since he was 5, Collin\nCassinat is walking in sunshine.\n\n   Diagnosed with a genetic disorder that makes him hypersensitive\nto the sun, the 11-year-old has lived much of his life in the dark.\n\n   Windows in his home are tinted and covered with blinds. The\nfamily van is outfitted with blackout curtains. When Collin goes to\nschool, he dashes from car to classroom covered with a blanket.\n\n   He waits until sundown to play outdoors.\n\n   Two weeks ago, Collin received the gift of freedom - a pale blue\ngarment that covers him head to toe and blocks ultraviolet rays.\nCooled by ice packs fitted into the suit, the boy now can venture\noutdoors even at high noon.\n\n   ``It'll give him a little more independence, and it will give\nhim a little more of a normal life,'' said his mother, Cindy\nCassinat. ``He won't have to be on the inside looking out.''\n\n   The clothing came from the HED Foundation, a Virginia-based\nagency that aids children suffering a variety of disorders,\nincluding sensitivity to sunlight.\n\n   Collin's condition is called xeroderma pigmentosum. Only about\n130 cases of XP are known in the United States, with an estimated\n1,000 worldwide.\n\n   In 1997, the grandmother of two English boys with a related\ndisorder challenged the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration to design a protective garment. Using space\ntechnology, NASA made its first suit in 1998.\n\n   Since then, more than 50 children have received the\nUV-protective clothing. The $2,000 cost of each suit is paid\nthrough donations, said HED Foundation president and founder, Sarah\nMoody.\n\n   Last fall, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell orchestrated a\n$100,000 contribution from Warner Bros.\n\n   ``The freedom we have given these children you would not\nbelieve,'' Moody said. ``It's given them a quality of life they\nwould not have had.''\n\n   Collin's first adventure outdoors was a romp in his yard. Then\nhe walked down the street to visit his friend Kevin Dompier. That\nfelt ``cool,'' he said.\n\n   At Greenfield Elementary School, he could join his classmates at\nrecess instead of playing in the hallway.\n\n   There have been longer trips - an outing to Home Depot with his\ndad, Tony, and to big brother Christopher's late-afternoon\ngraduation from Gilbert High School.\n\n   Seeing her son gamboling outside during the day - even in\nclothes designed to protect him - has left Cindy Cassinat a little\nnervous.\n\n   The suit's soft fabric, called Sun Weave, seems so flimsy, she\nsaid. Accustomed to covering every inch of her son's body for so\nmany years, she cinches the hood tight around his eyes underneath\ngoggles and makes him wear an additional hat.\n\n   She has had to put her faith in NASA technology, she said.\n\n   The suit isn't a perfect solution. Putting on the whole outfit -\nincluding pants, jacket, gloves, socks, veil and goggles - takes\nabout 10 minutes.\n\n   Collin gets hot despite wearing a bulky cooling vest.\n\n   And dressed in a suit that he says makes him look ``bluey,''\nCollin attracts attention. At Christopher's graduation, some kids\nteased him. Even adults stared.\n\n   Cindy remains concerned about the suit's protective powers. She\nfears letting Collin lift the veil to eat.\n\n   Given the severity of the boy's disorder, her fears are well\nfounded. Exposure to sunlight for just minutes would cause his skin\nto redden, burn and blister. An overdose could kill him.\n\n   He has had several operations to remove skin cancers.\n\n   But for special occasions, the suit will free Collin from his\ndaytime confinement. Tony Cassinat wants to plan outdoor family\nexcursions.\n\n   Collin's friends think he looks good and a little ``scary'' in\nhis suit. They're glad he can play outside now even if it's just a\nwalk down the street to hunt rocks.\n\n   ``He never got to go out in the day. He could only play at\nnight,'' said buddy Jare LaRiviere, 9. ``It's pretty cool for\nCollin.''   \n   \nReach the reporter at Barbara.Yost(at)ArizonaRepublic   \n.com or (602) 444-7936.  \n","Headline":"\nFREEDOM TO WALK IN THE SUNSHINE \n","Text":["\n     \n(GILBERT, Ariz.) - For the first time since he was 5, Collin\nCassinat is walking in sunshine.\n","\n   Diagnosed with a genetic disorder that makes him hypersensitive\nto the sun, the 11-year-old has lived much of his life in the dark.\n","\n   Windows in his home are tinted and covered with blinds.
