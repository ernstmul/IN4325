No. Is it easier\nfor the surgeon to do? No. Is it easier for the patients? No...I\nthink it's a very clever device, but it addresses a problem that\ndoesn't exist,'' Puliafito said.\n\n   Ten years ago, as KeraVision began investing a reported $100\nmillion in developing Intacs, there will still widespread doubts\nabout whether laser surgery would prove workable and a market would\ndevelop for a reversible procedure.\n\n   ``I still haven't seen anyone who wants theirs reversed,'' said\nPuliafito, who said at his center, 30 laser eye surgeries are\nperformed a week.\n\n   One reason rings may be slow to catch on is that there is no\nshortage of medical centers licensed to do the laser work.\nConsumers in eastern Massachusetts, for instance, can choose from\namong a half-dozen, and the Department of Public Health estimates\nanother 12 or 13 Bay State hospitals and facilities are licensed to\nperform the surgery.\n\n   Azar, the Eye and Ear Infirmary's associate chief of\nophthalmology and director of several surgery services, is also an\nassociate professor at the University of Paris medical center. He\nhas been to Paris to learn how to insert the rings _ European\nauthorities approved their use in 1996 _ and says he thinks the\nresults ``are beautiful,'' but comparable to what lasers can do.\n\n   But Azar notes that one drawback is that the rings come in three\nfixed sizes, while lasers can be minutely modified, like the\ndifference between wearing a tailored shirt or one that comes only\nin small, medium or large.\n\n   Lasik began as a procedure used only on severe cases of\nnearsightedness, but as surgeons have learned to improve the\ntechnique, it is being used on progressively milder cases as an\nalternative to PRK because people heal faster and see better sooner\nwith Lasik.\n\n   These days, Azar said, the only reason for choosing PRK over\nLasik is if you have a tissue condition in the eye that makes\nslicing a flap dangerous or if you need less than about 2.5 to 3.5\ndiopters of vision correction, depending on the threshold a\nparticular surgeon has set for doing PRK instead of Lasik.\n\n   Direct comparisons between diopters and the more commonly\nunderstood 20/20 system of describing poor vision are difficult.\nBut roughly speaking, someone with 20/40 vision (the minimum to get\na driver's license) needs 0.75 to 1.25 diopters of correction to\nget to 20/20, Azar said. Two diopters corresponds to 20/100, and\nthree diopters 20/400.\n\n   Two years ago, Azar said, he performed Lasik only on people\nneeding more than 6 diopters of correction. Now he routinely does\nit on cases of people who need only 2.5 diopters, and it is likely\nthe ``flap and zap'' procedure will supplant even more use of PRK.\n\n   The corneal rings, in contrast, have been approved only for\ncorrecting 1 to 3.5 diopters of vision in myopic people, and not\nyet to fix farsightedness or astigmatism.\n\n   In the US, the practice of surgically changing the eye to\ncorrect vision dates back to the late 1970s when a pair of American\ndoctors travelled to the then-Soviet Union to learn about a\nprocedure called radial keratotomy, in which incisions are made in\nradial patterns around the cornea to flatten it.\n\n   In the United States, RK procedures, counted as one for each\neye, peaked at about 300,000 in 1994 and 1995, but have since\ndwindled as lasers have promised more precise, less painful, easier\nhealing correction, according to Arons, the consultant.\n\n   Every year since 1996, the number of laser eye surgeries has\nroughly doubled, according to Arons' figures. He projects 850,000\neyes will be operated on this year _ overwhelmingly Lasik, and\noverwhelmingly two eyes per person _ and another 1.2 million in\n2000. Arons does not see rings taking more than 3 to 5 percent of\nthe market.\n\n   Anne Sumers, a private-practice ophthalmologist in Ridgewood,\nN.J., who is a spokesperson for the ophthamology academy, said it\nis important for people considering any eye surgery to keep in mind\nthat ``it doesn't make your vision better than what you have with\ncontacts or glasses. It's basically just a procedure for\nconvenience.''\n\n   One drawback to all surgeries, including rings, is that people\nhave to choose whether they want to see well near or far.\n\n   Because people's ability to change focus with their eyes\ndeclines with age, if you are older than 40 and get laser surgery\nto improve your distance vision, you almost certainly will have to\nget reading glasses, even if you do not use them now, Sumers said.\nOr if you choose the surgery to make it easier to read a book or\nwork at the computer, you are likely to need glasses for driving or\nnight vision.\n\n   Moreover, at about $4,000 out-of-pocket per pair of eyes, the\ncost of laser work or rings easily cover decades or a lifetime\nworth of contact lenses or eyeglasses.\n\n   In the Boston area, regular eyeglass lenses run an average $75\nplus the cost of frames, which are generally about $100 but can\ncost much more. Bifocals lenses are about $110, Azar said.\n\n   For two eyes, regular contacts run from about $140 for a\nhigh-quality permanent or six-month pair up to $600 for contacts\nyou throw out every day, not counting the cost of cleaning\nsolutions, according to Dr. Sheri Morneault, director of the Eye\nand Ear Infirmary's contact lens service.\n\n   Another option rolled out this month is a disposable bifocal\ncontact lens made by Johnson & Johnson. About 1 percent of the 33\nmillion contacts sold in the last year were bifocals, and no one\nwith the marketing might of J & J has entered the market.\n\n   The Acuvue lenses have five concentric rings that alternately\ncorrect near or far vision. No one can control where a lens sits on\nthe eye, but the brain selects the appropriate focus. The contacts\ncost about $350 to $500 per year for two eyes.\n\n   For anyone with reservations about any of the surgical\napproaches, ``The safest choice is still to get a good pair of\nglasses,'' Sumers said. One unchallenged upside of glasses and\ncontact lenses is that they can be readjusted every year, Sumers\nsaid, while repeated surgery on the eye is both costly and\npotentially risky.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   The New England Eye Center's Puliafito is especially skeptical\nabout Intacs, saying: ``Is it better than laser?
