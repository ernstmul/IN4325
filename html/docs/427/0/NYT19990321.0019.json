It was in Phoenix, where Barkley says\nthe Suns have a team that won't even reach the playoffs.\n\n   Saturday night, Barkley made amends against his old ballclub,\nscoring a season-high 35 points, including the first six on three\nunanswered baskets in overtime, and grabbed 18 rebounds as the\nRockets beat the Suns, 103-93, at the Compaq Center.\n\n   Barkley and the Rockets sent the Suns home with their third loss\non a four-game road trip.\n\n   Suns Coach Danny Ainge, after wearing Barkley down with Joe\nKleine defending him in Phoenix, tried the same ploy in the\novertime.\n\n   ``It worked for them once, so they tried it again,'' Barkley\nsaid. ``Only this time we weren't playing the second game\nback-to-back.''\n\n   And he made Kleine a profit. The Suns' reserve center had said,\nafter limiting Barkley to two fourth-quarter baskets in Phoenix,\nthat if Barkley is hitting his mid-range jump shots, ``you're at\nhis mercy.''\n\n   They were, and he was merciless, scoring inside and outside.\n\n   ``That's why he's one of the top 50 players of all time,''\nKleine said.\n\n   Ainge agreed. ``It's pick your poisin in the overtime,'' he\nsaid. ``Do we play him man-to-man and hope he can't post us up, or\ndo we double-team and let them shoot threes?'' he said. ``It's a\nhelpless feeling.''\n\n   Still, it took all Barkley had to keep the Suns from stealing\nanother from Houston.\n\n   The Suns had an opportunity to win in regulation, but Scottie\nPippen forced Phoenix guard Rex Chapman into a turnover with 5.1\nseconds remaining, ma king up for his own turnover with 14 seconds\nto go that opened the door for the Suns.\n\n   ``We just had a miscommunication,'' Chapman said. ``I take\nresponsibility because I'm a guard out on the court. I don't think\neverybody knew what we were doing. We were trying to get me a shot\noff a screen, and the play broke do wn.\n\n   ``We played hard, but there's no excuse for the mental\nbreakdowns. You can live with the physical mistakes, but we lost\nthis game because of mental mistakes.''\n\n   If the Suns had played with the same exuberance they had in\nHouston in their fourth game in five nights on the road earlier in\nthe trip, they would have gotten out of Charlotte or Atlanta with a\nvictory.\n\n   They hit the boards, scrambled for loose balls. Luc Longley even\ndrove past Hakeem Olajuwon for a slam dunk.\n\n   ``Who was that guy?'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge asked.\n\n   With Tom Gugliotta pouring in 12 of his team-high 22 points in\nthe first quarter, the Suns mounted a 27-22 lead. Still, they had\nto weather an 18-0 second-quarter Houston run to stay in the game.\nAnd the Rockets mounted it with center Hakeem Olajuwon and Pippen\non the bench.\n\n   It started after Danny Manning's 17-foot shot put the Suns up\n29-22 less than a minute into the quarter.\n\n   Charles Barkley's postup move in the lane started it with 10:50\nto go in the second and Barkley's fade-away jumper, then a power\nmove in the paint capped it with 6:04 to go in the half.\n\n   Manning finally ended it with a driving layup, and that started\na surprising 11-1 Phoenix counterpunch that trimmed a 40-29 deficit\nto two points.\n\n   And the Suns actually regained the lead briefly when Gugliotta\npushed the ball up the floor, kicked it to Kidd, who fed Robinson's\nfor the finish and a 46-45 lead. But Pippen hit his first shot of\nthe half, a three-pointer, with 19.9 seconds to go and Othella\nHarrington's free throw with less than a second remaining sent the\nRockets to the locker room with a 49-46 halftime lead.\n\n   Again, the Suns responded, this time with one of their best\nthird-quarter performances of the season. The third quarter is\noften their Achilles heel. It was 24 hours earlier in Atlanta.\n\n   But the starting five rallied to a 60-60 tie, then the reserves\ncame in and kept it going. Rex Chapman's three-point shot with half\na second to go in the quarter gave the Suns their biggest lead of\nthe game to that point, 77-68.\n\n   The Rockets rallied behind Barkley. He scored their first five\npoints in a 10-0 Houston run to start the final period. His\noffensive rebound and putback basket with 6:16 to play started\nanother spurt, this one 8-2 that gave the Rockets an 86-84 lead\nwith 4:03 to go in the game. And Barkley's fastbreak lay up with\n1:31 to go gave Houston a three-point advantage.\n\n   That set the stage for the Suns last-gasp effort.  \n","Headline":"\nBARKLEY, ROCKETS KNOCK OFF SUNS \n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ Charles Barkley was embarrassed the last time the\nHouston Rockets lost a game.
