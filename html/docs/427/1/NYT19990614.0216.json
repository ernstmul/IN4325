BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   As warm and wonderful as it feels to bask under the rays of the\nsummer sun, it is not very good for the body. In my teen-age years,\nwe had tanning contests to see who could get the darkest the\nfastest. In my 20s, I slathered my bikini-clad body in baby oil to\nattract as many tanning rays as I could in the little time I had\nfor sunbathing. Now, decades later, when I look at the spotted skin\nthat has begun to wrinkle on my arms and legs, I cannot help\nwishing I had known then what I know now.\n\n   Although most Americans still precede the word ``tan'' with\n``healthy,'' it is anything but. A tan, which results from the\nformation of the pigment melanin in skin cells called melanocytes,\nis the body's attempt to defend itself against sun damage.\n\n   Melanin absorbs some of the incoming rays to keep them from\nharming other cells. But this protection is far from complete. I\nonly hope that by protecting my skin from further sun damage I will\nnot end up like my my grandmother, who lived on a beach and whose\nskin resembled elephant hide by the time she reached 70.\n\n   At this point, we all should know better, but I still see\nsunbathers galore, mostly teen-agers and young adults and a fair\nnumber of baby boomers minimally clad and well greased as they seek\na so-called ``healthy tan.'' Because it is unlikely that sun-loving\nAmericans will suddenly take to the shade, pharmaceutical and skin\ncare companies have come up with a host of new products that can\nhelp to minimize _ though not eliminate _ the damage of sun\nexposure.\n\n   By now everyone knows that it is ultraviolet, or UV, rays that\nboth tan and damage the skin. The wavelengths of concern are UVB\n(290 to 320 nanometers) and shorter and longer UVA (320 to 400\nnanometers). The atmosphere's ozone layer blocks another type, UVC\n(200 to 290 nanometers), as well as large amounts of UVB. But the\ncloser the sun is to the earth's surface and the more degraded the\nozone layer, the more UVB gets through.\n\n   Although UVB has long been recognized as the cause of sunburns\nand superficial skin cancers called basal-cell carcinomas, recent\nstudies have implicated it as a cause of melanoma, the most serious\nform of skin cancer, as well. One or two blistering sunburns early\nin life can greatly increase the risk of developing a potentially\nfatal melanoma.\n\n   Also, those who are exposed to occasional bursts of sunlight,\nlike indoor workers who spend weekends and vacations in the sun,\nappear to be at greater risk of melanoma than people who are\ncontinuously exposed, like farmers and fishermen.\n\n   However, farmers and fishermen and others who are always in the\nsun get many basal-cell carcinomas on exposed parts of their\nbodies. The fairer the skin, the more prone people are to\ndeveloping superficial skin cancers. A blond, blue-eyed friend just\nhad 14 of these lesions removed from his face and back. Though not\nas deadly as melanoma, these cancers can eventually spread if not\nremoved, a process that can leave noticeable scars, especially on\nthe face.\n\n   UVA radiation may also be implicated in cancer. It can damage\nthe genes, especially a tumor suppressor gene called p-53, and\nimpair the workings of the immune system. But the damage it most\ncommonly causes is premature aging of the skin, or photoaging:\nwrinkled, leathery skin pockmarked with brown spots.\n\n   The longer rays of UVA can penetrate the deeper layers of the\nskin where they degrade the elastic fibers and collagen that keep\nthe skin smooth and firm. If you would like to know how young your\nskin would look had it not been repeatedly exposed to UVA, check\nyour buttocks. Or compare the skin on the outside of your arms with\nthe side against your body.\n\n   People who frequent tanning salons are assaulting their skin\nwith high doses of UVA radiation. UVA can also penetrate window\nglass, including car windows. It passes through water and it is\nreleased as well from fluorescent and halogen bulbs. Unlike UVB,\nwhich is more intense in summer, at midday and at higher altitudes,\nUVA radiation is much less affected by season, time of day or\naltitude. It is present all day year-round everywhere and it\nrepresents more than 90 percent of the UV radiation that reaches\nthe earth's surface.\n\n   Anyone shopping for skin protection products is bound to be\nconfused. Labels state sun protection factors, or SPF, ranging from\n4 to 60 and make claims like ``waterproof,'' ``water resistant,''\n``sweat proof,'' ``all-day protection,'' ``complete protection''\nand ``total sunblock.'' New regulations, which the Skin Cancer\nFoundation worries will further confuse the public, will create\nonly three categories ``minimal'' (SPF 2 to 12), ``moderate'' (12\nto 30) and ``high'' sunburn protection (30 or more).\n\n   The first fact worth noting is that the rating refers only to\nthe product's ability to reduce exposure to UVB radiation.\nLaboratory tests using liberal amounts of the product reveal how\nmuch longer a person may be protected from sunburn than if no\nsunscreen were applied. Thus, if you would normally burn in 20\nminutes in the sun, using a product with an SPF rating of 15 would\ntheoretically keep you from burning for five hours.\n\n   However, there are three important limitations. One, to be most\neffective, sunscreens should be applied half an hour before\nexposure. Second, most people do not apply nearly enough sunscreen\nto achieve laboratory levels of protection. The amount an\naverage-size adult in a bathing suit should use is one ounce per\napplication, repeated every few hours. The way most people use\nsunscreen the rating would be only half or less what the label\nstates, so you would be wise to choose a product with high sunburn\nprotection. Third, unless you use a product that offers good\nprotection against both UVB and UVA radiation, even if you do not\nburn, you will be exposing your skin to a lot of UVA damage.\n\n   There are more than two dozen new products available that offer\nmore complete UV protection. These contain either micronized zinc\noxide or titanium oxide or Parsol 1789 (avobenzone). Other products\ncontaining benzophenone also reduce exposure to UVA but not as\neffectively, studies have indicated.\n\n   Women who wear face makeup would be wise to choose a product\nthat offers such protection, and everyone who is in the sun even\nsporadically during the day can benefit from the use of a face\nlotion that offers UVA and UVB protection; it should be applied\nliberally and reapplied whenever the face is washed. Also apply a\nlip balm with full protection repeatedly throughout the day. Note,\nhowever, that it is not yet known whether products containing\nvitamin E, vitamin C or other antioxidants enhance their sun\nprotection value.\n\n   Of course, the best way to avoid sun damage is to stay out of it\nas much as possible. When in the sun, wear a hat with a brim at\nleast three inches wide and protect your eyes with sunglasses (UV\nlight can cause cataracts). Relax in the shade, but since UV rays\nscatter, use sunscreen even if you are under an awning or beach\numbrella. And, whenever possible, cover your skin with clothing.\n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: IN A CULTURE OF SUNBATHERS, TIPS FOR SHIELDING THE\nSKIN \n","Text":["\n   As warm and wonderful as it feels to bask under the rays of the\nsummer sun, it is not very good for the body.
