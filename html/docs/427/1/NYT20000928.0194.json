In fact, the concern almost escalated to a\nthe-sky-is-falling kind of intensity.\n\n   What scared folks who were knowledgeable about the ozone layer's\nrole in the environmental scheme of things was that its depletion\ncould lead to increased smog, damage to food crops and marine\necosystems, as well as increases in skin cancer and cataracts.\n\n   That could happen, and may be happening, because the ozone layer\nscreens the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Such\nworries, along with fears of global warming, prompted most of the\nmajor nations of the world to send representatives to Kyoto, Japan,\nin 1997 to make some serious commitments to take remedial action to\ncombat those interconnected environmental threats.\n\n   The same greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming play\nan important role in depleting the Earth's protective layer of\nstratospheric ozone. Compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, the\nstuff that used to be contained in most aerosol propellants and the\nrefrigerants in refrigerators and home and automobile air\nconditioners, also eat away at the ozone layer.\n\n   In 1970, scientists involved in an Antarctic expedition warned\nthat there might be a hole in the layer. And in 1985, a U.S.\nweather satellite confirmed the existence of one.\n\n   Other satellites also discovered a hole at the Earth's other\npolar area. But the Arctic hole is smaller. The difference is said\nto have something to do with the action of polar stratospheric\nclouds at the South Pole that increase in winter and exacerbate the\ndestruction of ozone in the Antarctic.\n\n   WMO scientists say the southern ozone hole is larger this year\nthan it has ever been and that ozone levels are 50 to 70 percent\nbelow what they were when the hole was first detected. National\nAeronautics and Space Administration officials say it is spread\nover 11 million square miles, extending over all of Antarctica and\nreaching the southern tip of South America, an area three times\ngreater than the U.S. mainland.\n\n   One wouldn't expect the hole to continue to grow in light of\nactions that governments and businesses have taken or promised to\ntake to prevent it. In the United States, many ozone-depleting\nsubstances have been phased out, and stringent regulations have\nbeen imposed to control the release of refrigerants while servicing\nor disposing of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment.\n\n   The layman, then, might logically expect the ozone holes to be\ngetting smaller instead of larger. But some scientists say there is\ncause to become fatalistic about ozone depletion. They say the\ngrowth in the holes is the result of ozone-destroying substances\nthat were realized years ago because that stuff takes a long time\nto get up to the stratosphere.\n\n   That means the effects of efforts to keep more\nchlorofluorocarbons from getting up to the layer will not show up\nfor years to come. That's comforting. But there could be another\nreason for the size of the 2000 Antarctic hole.\n\n   This, after all, is a presidential election year. And there is\nan extraordinary amount of hot air being emitted on the hustings.\nThat stuff travels fast because most it lacks any real substance.\nThat means it shouldn't take it long to get up there and do as much\ndamage to the stratosphere as it is wreaking upon the credibility\nof the process by which Americans choose their leaders.\n\n   (Cecil Johnson is a former columnist and editorial writer for\nthe Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
