Times News Service   \n\n   PREVENTION: A Plan to Keep Drivers Free of Seizures  \n\n   Seizure disorders can be controlled by medication, but not for\nall patients and not always perfectly. That makes driving a gamble,\nwhich is why most states require people with epilepsy to be\nseizure-free for a specified length of time before they get behind\nthe wheel.\n\n   Now a new study, published in the current issue of the journal\nNeurology, will help physicians design safer driving programs for\npatients by offering them a way to evaluate their risks.\n\n   Dr. Gregory Krauss, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in\nBaltimore who led the study, said the project was organized because\nso many patients in the university's epilepsy clinic crashed after\nhaving seizures while driving.\n\n   While seizures account for only a tiny portion of the nation's\nauto fatalities each year, and only 10 percent of crashes involving\nepileptics are attributed to sizures, it is still a subject of\ngreat anxiety to patients weighing the risks of driving.\n\n   The study, undertaken by researchers at Johns Hopkins and the\nUniversity of Maryland looked at the driving and medical histories\nof 100 epilepsy patients, half of whom had been involved in\nseizure-related crashes.\n\n   The biggest factor in predicting risk was the length of time a\npatient had been seizure-free. Those who had gone a year or more\nwere 90 percent less likely to crash than those with shorter\nintervals.\n\n   Another finding was that patients whose seizures were preceded\nby auras _ an odd sensation or movement _ were less likely to\ncrash. But Krauss cautioned that auras gave only limited\nprotection: some patients were unable to get off the road in time\nto make use of the warning, he said.\n\n   Krauss said he was surprised by the number of patients who were\nnot reporting seizures to motor vehicle authorities, as required by\nlaw. More than half of the drivers who crashed were driving sooner\nafter a seizure than the law allowed.\n\n   Krauss suggested doctors make these points to patients: Take\nrules regarding waiting periods after seizures seriously; keep up\nwith medication and have it adjusted as needed, and act fast if a\nwarning sign occurs.\n\n   REMEDIES: For Broken Teeth, It's Low-Fat Milk  \n\n   Answer: Pour a glass of milk and see me right away.\n\n   Question: What is a dentist's advice in the event of a\nknocked-out tooth?\n\n   Actually, the very best thing to do is put the tooth right back\nin the socket it came out of. But few people are willing to try\nthat, especially when it's their child's tooth they're holding,\nsaid Dr. Leif K. Bakland, a professor of dentistry at Loma Linda\nUniversity in California. ``Parents are often squeamish about doing\nthat and they worry about doing it right.''\n\n   Bakland made a presentation last week to a conference in Atlanta\nof the American Association of Endodontists, root canal\nspecialists, on a new approach to educating the public about steps\nto take to help insure successful reinsertion of displaced teeth.\n\n   The two biggest threats to the tooth are dehydration and\ninfection, he said. Putting a tooth in water is better than letting\nit dry out, but there the tooth faces the opposite problem _ cells\nin the root may absorb so much water that they burst, sometimes\nwithin minutes.\n\n   Milk, on the other hand, is not only free of harmful bacteria,\nBakland said, but is also absorbed slowly enough to pose far less\nof a threat than water.\n\n   ``Skim or low-fat milk is best for the tooth, but don't waste\ntime looking for it if whole milk is the only type available,'' he\nsaid. ``The difference isn't significant.''\n\n   Once the tooth is safely doused, call a dentist or head to an\nemergency room, he advised.\n\n   In the case of the emergency room, ask whether there is a\ndentist on staff, Bakland added. In most cases, a root canal will\nbe performed to remove damaged tissue, and the tooth crowned.\n\n   But time is of the essence, he said. So get a glass and go.\n\n   SAFETY: Applying Sunscreen to a Playground  \n\n   In an effort to protect children from damaging ultraviolet rays,\nthree agencies plan to build what they describe as the nation's\nfirst intentionally sun-safe playground.\n\n   The Children's Aid Society, the American Academy of\nDermatologists, and Kaboom, a playground safety group, will\nundertake the project on Friday at the Goodhue Center on Staten\nIsland.\n\n   ``The sun produces rays of ultraviolet light that can enter the\nskin and cause a variety of changes,'' said Dr. Roger Ceilley, a\ndermatologist who is a past president of the academy and\nco-chairman of the National Coalition for Sun Safety. ``Damage to\nDNA can lead to skin cancer, damage to collagen and to elastic\ntissue can lead to premature aging, and sunlight that goes\nunfiltered into the eyes can lead to cataracts and other eye\nproblems,'' he added.\n\n   The dermatologists academy estimates that children get 80\npercent of their lifetime sun exposure by the time they turn 18,\nand that a child born in 1999 has a 1-in-5 risk of developing skin\ncancer.\n\n   ``While kids are at school, they go out to play in the late\nmorning, noon or early afternoon,'' Ceilley said. ``The sun is the\nmost dangerous then. Through volunteer efforts, people have been\ninstalling equipment-safe playgrounds around the country. Why not\nmake them safe for sun protection?''\n\n   Ilene Pappert, director of the Goodhue Center, said the\nplayground would have swings, a seesaw, covered bridges and\ntube-encased slides, and the entire structure would be shielded\nfrom the sun by a special cover that is like a tarpaulin. Benches\nwill be shaded with roofs to protect the adults watching the\nchildren.\n\n   Ceilley also offered the following sun-safety guidelines:\n``Avoid midday sun. If you are out in it, wear a hat with at least\na four-inch brim, protective clothes, a minimum of No. 15\nsunscreen, and make sure it's reapplied if you're in and out of\nwater.''\n\n   LONGEVITY: Cabernet Sauvignon, the Healthy Toast?  \n\n   Almost 30 years ago, researchers discovered that Europeans in\nMediterranean countries were less likely to suffer from heart\ndisease than people elsewhere. This better health was attributed to\nthe Mediterranean diet, one low in meat and high in fruits,\nvegetables, olive oil and wine.\n\n   In an editorial in the current issue of the journal Heart, a\ncardiologist in the Bordeaux region of France, Dr. Jean-Paul\nBroustet, recounted three decades of research on the health\nbenefits of wine, concluding that cabernet sauvignon made from\nBordeaux grapes was the best wine to drink for good cardiovascular\nhealth and longevity.\n\n   He wrote that the highest concentrations of resveratrol, a\ncompound that is said to reduce cholesterol in the body and help\nprevent clogged arteries and blood clots, was typically found in\nBordeaux grapes. He also noted that good amounts of quercitin,\nwhich helps to break up clots and to dilate blood vessels,\nincreasing circulation, were also present in his native crop.\n\n   But Broustet warned against the dangers of overindulgence,\nincluding high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver and car\ncrashes.\n\n   He advocated a regimen of a daily consumption of a half bottle\nof red wine with food.\n","Headline":"\nHEALTH NOTES AND NEWS \n","Text":["\n   PREVENTION: A Plan to Keep Drivers Free of Seizures  \n","\n   Seizure disorders can be controlled by medication, but not for\nall patients and not always perfectly.
