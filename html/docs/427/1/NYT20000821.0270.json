Or\nyou may notice a loss of central vision. Such troubles can signal a\nsight-robbing disease called macular degeneration, affecting some\n13 million people over the age of 50.\n\n   Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, affects the retina,\ncausing progressive vision loss. Typically, it starts with loss of\nsight at the center of the visual field, so sufferers immediately\nlose the ability to read. AMD rarely leaves its victims completely\nblind; in most cases peripheral vision remains. There are two kinds\nof AMD: 90 percent of sufferers have the ``dry'' form, which is\nslow-progressing; the remaining 10 percent suffer from the ``wet''\nform of AMD, in which sight loss tends to be severe and rapid. It's\ncaused by the growth of abnormal, leaking blood vessels beneath the\nretina.\n\n   There's no cure or treatment for dry AMD, and the only treatment\nfor wet AMD until last April was laser therapy to cauterize the\nbleeding vessels _ an imperfect method that leaves blank or black\nspots in the vision. Now some wet-AMD patients are candidates for\nVisudyne, a new light-sensitive injectable drug used with cool\nlaser treatment to destroy the problematic blood vessels and avoid\ndamaging the retina.\n\n   ``This is a tremendous advantage,'' says Dr. Lylas G. Mogk,\ndirector of the Visual Rehabilitation and Research Center at the\nHenry Ford Health System in Grosse Pointe, Mich., and coauthor\n(with her daughter) of ``Macular Degeneration: The Complete Guide\nto Saving and Maximizing Your Sight'' (Ballantine; $14.95). ``But\nit doesn't stop new vessels from growing, so in most cases you'll\nneed to keep doing it.''\n\n   A growing body of research points to the importance of adopting\nsome simple, healthful habits to help prevent AMD:\n\n   WEAR YOUR SUNGLASSES\n\n   The latest word in protection is melanin. In powdered form, it's\nused by some sunglass manufacturers, including Code Melanin-XP and\nChanel, to coat lenses and block not only UV rays but also blue\nlight (aka High Energy Visible, or HEV, light). ``Research seems to\npoint to blue light as one of the culprits (in AMD),'' says Mogk.\n``You always hear that UV is the bad guy _ it does promote\ncataracts _ but UV light doesn't get to the retina.'' Blue light\ndoes.\n\n   SEE YOUR DOCTOR\n\n   Factors that affect your risk for AMD include sun exposure, a\nfamily history, fair skin and/or light eyes, smoking and a diet low\nin antioxidants. Hypertension and a high-fat diet may increase risk\nas well. Everyone over the age of 40 should visit an\nophthalmologist every two years. If you're 50 or older, annual\nvisits are advised.\n\n   EAT YOUR GREENS\n\n   Kale, collard greens and spinach contain lots of lutein, a\ncarotenoid antioxidant that seems to have a protective effect on\nthe macula in people at high risk for AMD. Taking lutein _ in food\nor supplements _ may help, says Dr. Alfred Kulik, an\nophthalmologist in private practice in New York and New Jersey.\n``We're not talking about reversing loss, just potentially slowing\nit down.''\n\n   TAKE YOUR MULTIVITAMIN\n\n   Vitamins A, C and E have also been anecdotally linked to a\nreduced incidence of AMD. Stores today carry special multivitamins\nand ``eye supplements'' containing antioxidants and lutein\n(Ocuvite, ICaps, Centrum), but, cautions Dr. Nathan Congdon,\nassistant professor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute at\nJohns Hopkins, ``There's not much evidence that an eye vitamin is\nmore beneficial than a standard multivitamin.''\n\n   FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\n   American Academy of Ophthalmology: www.eyenet.org.
