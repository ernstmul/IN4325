You can do your body some\ngood without turning into a marathon-running, power-bar-munching\nhealth devotee. Here are 10 simple favors you can do for your body.\n\n   1. Take the stairs. The elevator looks so inviting, but a\n150-pound person can burn 1 calorie every five steps by climbing\nstairs. Besides, you'll walk into the office flushed and a bit\nbreathless, so everyone will think you've had an interesting\nmorning.\n\n   2. Grocery bag barbells. The next time you go grocery shopping,\nsay, ``I can get it myself'' to the bagger. Then tote that box of\nTide and lift that gallon of milk for some casual weight lifting.\n\n   3. If you work at a desk all day, take the time to walk away and\nstretch every 20 or 30 minutes. This keeps your blood flowing\nthroughout the day and leaves you feeling not quite so tired, says\nKing Hoover, certified personal trainer at Fit for Life in Fort\nWorth.\n\n   ``Instead of having day left at the end of (your) energy,\n(you'll) have energy left at the end of the day,'' he said.\n\n   4. Learn to read labels. Packaged foods are required to have\nstandard, easy-to-read labels that describe their ingredients,\nincluding fat and sugar content. The labels also show what\npercentage of daily nutrition requirements the foods contain, but\nremember, those percentages are based on a 2,000-calorie daily\ndiet. Most women will gain weight on a 2,000-calorie diet, so\nadjust percentages accordingly.\n\n   5. Keep track of what you eat. Self-monitoring, or writing down\neverything that passes your lips, creates an awareness of eating\npatterns and helps you figure out where all those extra calories\ncome from. Two researchers reported in the journal Health\nPsychology that women who meticulously recorded every item they ate\nlost weight. Keep a notebook handy and remember to write down\neverything.\n\n   6. Use egg whites. You won't even notice the difference, but\nthere is an important one: ``The white is pure protein, and the\nyolk is the fat and cholesterol,'' says Roger Villers, assistant\nmanager of Bally Total Fitness in Fort Worth. Two egg whites will\ngenerally take the place of one whole egg. Other easy\nsubstitutions: olive or canola oil for butter; low-fat or skim milk\nfor whole.\n\n   7. Take a hike. Instead of circling the parking lot looking for\na space two feet from the door, go ahead and park your car in the\nnext ZIP code and walk. You'll probably get there just as fast. And\nwhen you're walking anywhere, don't meander, pick up the pace.\n\n   8. Cheap sunglasses. People who have had a great deal of sun\nexposure are far more likely to develop cataracts as senior\ncitizens, and research also suggests that UV radiation may\ncontribute to macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness\nin older Americans. A good pair of sunglasses doesn't have to be\nexpensive _ just make sure there's a sticker saying they block at\nleast 99 percent of ultraviolet rays. They help prevent wrinkling\naround the eyes, too.\n\n   9. Clean the house. Or work in the garden, or wash the car. An\nhour spent vigorously washing the car is considered an hour of\nlight exercise, which, for a 150-pound person, burns 250 calories.\nBurn an extra 250 calories a day for two weeks without increasing\nwhat you eat and you should lose 1 pound.\n\n   10. Have a glass of wine. After a hard day of lifting groceries\nand washing the car, relax with a glass of chianti. In the past few\nyears a number of research studies, including work by Harvard heart\nresearcher Dr. Charles Hennekens, have suggested that antioxidants\nin alcohol, particularly in red wine, have a beneficial effect on\nheart disease.\n\n   _\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com)\n","Headline":"\nEASY DOES IT: 10 SIMPLE WAYS TO STAY FIT\n","Text":["\n   Why does everything that's good for us have to be so difficult?\n","\n   Exercising and eating right seem even more challenging at this\ntime of year, when the heat makes everyone feel sluggish.\n","\n   Maybe the answer is to lower the bar.
