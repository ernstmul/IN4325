This is one of the most substantial ozone losses at\nthis altitude in the Arctic,'' the scientists said in a statement\nissued Wednesday.\n\n   The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is the key filter for\ndamaging ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in the Sun's rays. Without\nit, organisms suffer extensive DNA damage, which in humans results\nin a greater increase in the risk of skin cancer, eye cataracts and\ndefects in the body's immune defenses.\n\n   An Arctic ozone ``hole'' _ actually a thinning of the layer to\nless than half its usual density _ could easily be blown south by\nhigh-altitude winds, and appear over populated areas of North\nAmerica, Europe and the northern regions of Britain.\n\n   Scientists taking part in the ozone experiment, a joint\ninitiative by America's National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA), the European Ozone Research Coordinating\nUnit, based in Cambridge, England, and the European Union's\nresearch directorate, will pass their results to the Meteorological\nOffice, which is responsible for issuing warnings about UV-B\nlevels.\n\n   Although an ozone hole over the South Pole is a regular\nphenomenon, it is only in the past five years that scientists have\nbegun to witness a similar event over the North Pole.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 300-word article from THE INDEPENDENT newspaper in\nLondon, it must be purchased from the New York Times Syndicate's\nsales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at\n732-390-4697.
