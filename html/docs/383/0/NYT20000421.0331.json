Times News Service    \n\n   When the mayor of a small Midwestern town and his wife decided\nthey needed marriage counseling, they were wary of seeking out a\nlocal therapist, for fear of gossip. So without ever leaving their\nhome, they turned to the place where millions of anonymous business\nand personal transactions take place each day: the Internet.\n\n   The couple's cyber-search eventually landed them in the All\nRivers Online Christian Counseling Center, where they plugged in\ntheir credit card number and began engaging in e-mail counseling\nwith a psychologist who billed himself as ``Dr. Ralph.''\n\n   With Americans turning to the Internet to find the perfect sofa,\nor even a car, then why not a therapist?\n\n   To the excitement, and alarm, of experts in the field, new\nmental-health Web sites are beginning to pop up almost daily, and\nmany are offering the type of counseling once offered only in the\nintimacy of a therapist's office.\n\n   The players range from the folksy, like ``Dr. Ralph'' D'Onofrio,\na psychologist-Internet entrepreneur whose other ventures include\nChildprayer.com, a site that processes prayer requests for sick\nchildren, to nonprofit organizations that provide services like\ndepression-screening tests, to Ivy League psychiatry professors who\nhave developed sleekly designed Web sites featuring advice from\ndoctors with high-brow credentials.\n\n   Because of the free-form world of the Internet, the therapists\nare not subject to the rigorous system of interstate licensing that\ngoverns conventional, in-office counseling.\n\n   The phenomenon is so new that the major professional\norganizations are just working out their policies.\n\n   Some experts on mental health agree that online counseling,\nthrough e-mail, real-time e-mail exchange, and eventually video\nconferencing, is one of the most promising developments of the\nmaturing Internet because it opens up new treatment options to\npeople in remote areas, the disabled and those who feel too\nstigmatized to seek treatment for mental illnesses.\n\n   ``This form of communication is very important, because we have\novercome the basic limitations of space and distance _ and those\nare worth overcoming,'' said Dr. Zebulon Taintor, chairman of the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association's Committee on Telemedicine who is\na professor of psychiatry at New York University.\n\n   The committee has drafted some guidelines for online psychiatry\nthat address issues like appropriate behavior for doctors. Taintor\nsaid he expected approval by the association in late May.\n\n   But Mirean Coleman, head of the policy and practice of clinical\nsocial work committee for the National Association of Social\nWorkers, said privacy issues related to the Internet would have to\nremedied before her group would recommend online treatment.\n\n   Indeed, skeptics say the medium's anonymity allows patients to\nmisrepresent themselves by disguising their appearance. At the very\nleast, the skeptics say, doctors are at a disadvantage when they\ncannot hear the inflections of a patient's voice. Nor, they point\nout, is there anything to prevent an unqualified entrepreneur from\nputting out a shingle as a mental-health expert.\n\n   And while the fledgling field of online psychiatry has yet to\nyield any documented disasters, some Web sites have taken\nprecautionary steps to prevent crises like suicides. Some, for\nexample, have installed emergency systems where severely troubled\npatients are automatically referred to a local suicide hot line.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Some mental health experts see a world full of potential\ncatastrophes.\n\n   ``I think it's terrible, and it could be disastrous,'' said Dr.\nSheldon Miller, head of the department of psychiatry and behavioral\nsciences at Northwestern University and Hospital. ``You just don't\ndeal with strangers in that kind of format and expect anything\nwonderful to happen. There's no way of controlling the outcome, and\nI have a real problem with that.''\n\n   The ethical questions are just beginning to emerge, because\nmedical-related Web sites, and particularly those devoted to\npsychiatric care, are ``embryonic,'' said Claudine Singer, a senior\nanalyst with the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications.\nSpecific numbers for psychiatry-related Web sites are not\navailable, she said, and of the roughly 17,000 medical sites, only\n200 can be considered legitimate.\n\n   Like most everything on the Internet, it is the quality and\nthoroughness of the product that doctors are most concerned about.\nBut unlike buying a broken Palm Pilot on eBay, going wrong with\nmedical treatment can have serious consequences, doctors warn.\n\n   ``There's always a danger wherever there isn't a complete\ndiagnosis,'' Taintor said, stressing the importance of a\ntraditional, in-office doctor's visit before engaging in online\ntreatment. ``You want to have as much data as possible, and\nanything that compromises that is dangerous.''\n\n   Taintor added: ``If you were to ask where I recommend\ntelemedicine, it's wherever a psychiatrist isn't available. I still\nthink face-to-face treatment, with three dimensions and all the\ntextures that go on between doctor and patient, is much more\nimportant.''\n\n   Of course, those who most zealously promote online psychiatric\ntreatment say it could dramatically change the way patients and\ndoctors communicate with each other.\n\n   ``Going into chat rooms, you can see that people do establish\nintense relationships with other people, and they tend to disclose\nmuch more than they would when face to face,'' said Dr. Robert\nGugliemo, formerly the senior director of New York City's Family\nCourt Forensic Clinical Service and an assistant professor or\npsychiatry at New York Medical College who is now one of the new\nbreed of psychologists turned entrepreneur. Along with a colleague,\nDr. Arthur Sullivan, he has co-founded Mentalhealthline.com, a Web\nsite that offers mental health services, including counseling\nthrough e-mail.\n\n   Not surprisingly, another reason for the enthusiasm of mental\nhealth professionals is money. Because mental illness tends to be a\nchronic problem, psychiatric Web sites could translate into repeat\nvisits, turning them into a money-making venture, Singer says.\n\n   Gugliemo said, ``There is a big expectation that this could be\nvery profitable.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Â \n\n   There is some debate as to how patients should be charged for\ntreatment. D'Onofrio, for example, charges according to how much\ntime he spends reading and responding to an e-mail; typically,\nafter an initial free consultation, about $25 to $30 an hour. But\nothers, like Taintor, shun the idea of billing by the hour.\nGugliemo and Sullivan, meanwhile, hope to work with insurance\ncompanies to find ways to cover online counseling through corporate\nemployee assistance programs.\n\n   Dr. Peter Kramer, a professor of psychiatry at Brown University\nwho is the author of ``Should You Leave?'' and ``Listening to\nProzac,'' said it was the uncertain future of conventional\npsychiatry that led him to explore professional opportunities on\nthe Internet.\n\n   ``This is a hard time for psychiatry,'' said Kramer, who is on\nthe advisory board of Here2Listen.com, a psychiatric service site\nthat is backed by several Ivy League professors. ``Now, doctors\ntend to be funded on an ad-hoc basis. I don't know just which\ndirection things are going to take, but I thought that with this,\nat least there's some hope that if you get it right, you could set\nsome standard of quality and build on that.''\n\n   Here2Listen.com, which was started in February, features\narticles by doctors on topics like infidelity and ways to overcome\nshyness. The e-counseling portion of the site went online April 17,\nand includes a database of 300 psychiatrists where patients search\nfor the right doctor.\n\n   ``You can set your criteria, like that you want an\nAfrican-American doctor in Chicago, and we'll find them for you,''\nsaid Susan Sheehan, spokeswoman for Here2Listen.\n\n   Patients plug in their credit card numbers and engage in\none-on-one e-counseling in a secure chat room with a professional;\nfees vary according to what the individual doctor would charge for\nan in-office visit.\n\n   Others, like Taintor, have been more fully engaged in using\ntelemedical treatments for years, at least in a supplemental\nfashion. As part of his work with the Bedford Hills Correctional\nFacility in Westchester County, N.Y., Taintor works with inmates\nwho were seeing a therapist before they were imprisoned.\n\n   In one case, a drug-addicted woman who had ``really bonded''\nwith one of the psychiatrists in Taintor's private practice was\nincarcerated at Bedford Hills. Now that woman speaks with her\ndoctor each week via teleconferencing.\n\n   Meanwhile, those involved in the nonprofit sector are also\nworking on developing online tools for coping with often\nstigmatized mental illness, particularly depression.\n\n   Shela Halper, vice president of education for the National\nMental Health Association, said depression was the No. 1-searched\nillness on the Internet. In response, the association recently\nstarted offering depression screenings on its Web site.\n\n   ``Taking a depression screening test is one of the quickest and\neasiest ways of knowing if someone's experiencing depression,''\nHalper said. ``About 9 million Americans experience it, but less\nthan a third of them seek treatment because they're not aware of\nsigns and symptoms,'' or they are afraid to talk to their doctor\nabout it, she said.\n\n   Taking a screening test online and then bringing the results to\na psychiatrist can be the first step in treating a potential mental\nillness, Halper said.\n\n   Of course, the new breed of Web doctors are beginning to realize\nfor themselves the limits and opportunities associated with\npracticing on the Internet.\n\n   In the case of ``Brett'' _ the Midwestern mayor who sought\nonline marital counseling with his wife _ D'Onofrio, who is based\nin Indiana, said he realized that e-mail alone would not give him\nenough information to treat them, and he added some telephone\nconversations to their counseling.\n\n   ``E-mail is great, but when they first contacted me I knew I\nneeded to talk to them _ there are some things you can only get\nover the phone,'' Dr. D'Onofrio said. ``First, I feel out if I can\nbe of help, and if they can be comfortable with me. Sometimes I'll\ntell people they need to go to a doctor.''\n\n   Privacy, also, is a natural concern when dealing with the\nInternet, particularly when sensitive information is being\ntransmitted through computer servers that do not always seem\nsecure.\n\n   ``As Ken Starr showed the world, you can retrieve lots of e-mail\nmessages you thought were deleted, even at the White House,'' said\nTaintor, who does not rely on e-mail as a primary means of\ncommunication with his patients.\n\n   And then there is the issue of licensing: How to translate\ninterstate regulations into a world where no such boundaries exist?\n\n   ``In medicine, licensing is a control, a way to monitor,'' said\nDr. Miller of Northwestern. ``But the Internet doesn't deal with\nthat, and the consuming public has no idea who's back there.''\n\n   A spokesman for the Federation of State Medical Boards said that\nthe federation had not yet considered the licensing issue, and that\nso far, state medical boards were simply cautioning prospective\nusers of mental-health sites to check the credentials of the\ndoctors.\n\n   Of course, some doctors are hesitant about associating\nthemselves with what many consider an unreliable medium.\n\n   ``I think I'm wary,'' said Kramer, the Brown professor. ``Or at\nleast, I was wary, but I think there is room for extremely\nresponsible material on the Internet.''\n","Headline":"\nONLINE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES: AN OPPORTUNITY, OR AN ALARM? \n","Text":["\n   When the mayor of a small Midwestern town and his wife decided\nthey needed marriage counseling, they were wary of seeking out a\nlocal therapist, for fear of gossip.
