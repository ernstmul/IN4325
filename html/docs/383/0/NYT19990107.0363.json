Many are\ncandidates for supervised housing, where they can live in the\ncommunity while getting the help they need to manage their\nillnesses. Since 1990, the state and city have created more than\n3,800 units of supervised housing under a very successful program\ncalled New York/New York, which is credited with moving 4,000\nmentally ill New Yorkers off the streets. Last year the city and\nstate both authorized money for a follow-up initiative that would\nbe expanded to include both the mentally ill homeless and those who\nare in danger of becoming so.\n\n   Unfortunately, the program has gotten stalled because of\nsquabbles between the city and state. One particular sticking point\nhas been the state's refusal to cover the operational costs of the\nprogram. Since mental health has historically been a state\nresponsibility, we believe the Pataki administration should change\nits mind and shoulder the costs. Either way, the fight should\ncertainly not torpedo this useful and humane program.\n\n   Modern medicine has made it far easier to control the symptoms\nof mental illness, but many outpatients stop taking their\nprescriptions because they dislike the side effects. It is unclear\nwhether Goldstein had abandoned his own medication. The state has\nhad some success in using the threat of forced hospitalization to\nget cooperation from patients with a history of recalcitrance. It\nmay want to expand the program.\n\n   But there are other options with potential for wider application\nthat also deserve debate, such as expanding state Medicaid coverage\nto underwrite the cost of newer, more expensive anti-psychotic\ndrugs that do not have the drastic side effects that cause people\nto stop taking the older generation of medicine.\n\n   Neither supervised housing nor better medicine will bring Kendra\nWebdale back, and it is possible that no government initiative\ncould have averted her murder.
