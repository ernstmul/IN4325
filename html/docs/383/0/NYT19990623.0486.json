(af)  \n By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   The White House conference earlier this month on mental illness\nhighlighted the Clinton administration's campaign, led by Tipper\nGore, to achieve ``parity for all'' _ requiring health insurers to\nprovide the same coverage for mental illness that they provide for\nphysical illness. Bills in Congress would do the same.\n\n   The call for parity raises two questions. Is coverage of mental\nhealth the same as that of physical health? And who should decide?\n\n   Almost all employer-based policies impose higher co-payments and\nother stricter limits on coverage of mental illness. Critics often\nblame bias _ an irrational stigma attached to mental problems _ or\nignorance, misjudging the plight of the ``worried well'' or glibly\ndismissing the value of ``taking cures.''\n\n   Bias and ignorance are only a small part of the story. A new\nstudy by Richard G. Frank of Harvard University and Thomas G.\nMcGuire of Boston University shows that powerful economic forces\ncompel plans to discriminate between physical and mental health.\nCongress may still want to proceed. But markets will counteract\nparity in ways that advocates will almost surely not like.  \n\n   About 30 percent of Americans experience some diagnosable mental\ndisorder in a typical year. Only about 25 percent of them receive\ntreatment. About 4 percent of the population suffers in any year\nfrom the most severe problems: schizophrenia, manic depression and\nmajor depression. But only between 30 percent and 55 percent of\nthem receive treatment. Given the yawning need, why don't employers\noffer parity?\n\n   The Frank-McGuire study offers two economic reasons. First,\nadverse selection. A plan that offers generous coverage of mental\nhealth would attracts people with expensive mental health problems.\nIn health care, a few patients always account for a large fraction\nof expenditures.\n\n   The disparity is exaggerated for mental health, where 5 percent\nof such patients may account for 30 percent or more of costs. So a\nplan whose lavish benefits attract the sickest mentally ill people\ninvites bankruptcy.\n\n   One way to diminish adverse selection is for government to\nimpose parity. That way, plans could not easily tailor their\nbenefits to push the chronically mentally ill onto other insurers.\nBut health plans that offer equal physical and mental benefits\nwould butt up against a second insurance problem, moral hazard:\nchanges in behavior that are caused by the presence of insurance.\n\n   People with health insurance buy more medical treatments than do\nthe uninsured. But studies of patients in fee-for-service plans\nshow that the impact of insurance on demand for treatment was twice\nas large for treatment of mental problems as for physical problems,\nMcGuire said in a recent interview.\n\n   Part of the reason can be traced to the fact that nonsevere\nforms of mental illness are hard to diagnose and leave therapists\nwide discretion over course of treatment. He concludes that some of\nthe insurance-induced demand is for mental health services that\npatients did not deem very valuable when asked to pay themselves.\n\n   Here's a sobering estimate: about 12 percent of the population\nwith no diagnosable mental disorders receive treatment and account\nfor nearly a third of all visits for mental health. If parity\ndrives up mental health costs and premiums, the danger is that more\nemployers will drop coverage and more workers will turn it down\nbecause it will have become too expensive.  \n\n   The Frank-McGuire study, then, decisively concludes that\ncoverage of mental health is different from that of physical\nhealth. So should insurance coverage treat the two types of\npatients differently? Frank and McGuire used to think so, at least\nfor patients with nonsevere mental problems.\n\n   But they have changed their minds, for a reason advocates will\nfind upsetting. The difference between then and now, they say, is\nthe explosive rise of managed care. Under managed care, contractual\nniceties, like co-payments, deductibles and lifetime limits lose\ntheir importance because every expenditure, regardless of\ncontractual obligations, is subject to second-guessing. So managed\ncare has all the tools it needs to control costs even if Congress\nrequires parity.\n\n   ``Parity,'' Frank said, ``is affordable only because managed\ncare exists.'' But making parity work by driving patients into the\nscrupulous oversight of managed care is probably not what many of\nits advocates have in mind.\n\n   There are grounds for government to dictate the list of benefits\nthat every private plan offers as one way to dull their ability to\ntailor benefits to drive away the chronically ill. But the prospect\nof legislators selling priority of place to medical specialities\nbearing campaign gifts is hardly inspiring.\n\n   Perhaps a better idea would to turn the task over to a blue\nribbon panel that would hand its recommendations over to\nlegislatures for an up and down vote without amendment. That would\nput politicians in charge, but mute the craven features of the\ncurrent system.  \n","Headline":"\nECONOMIC SCENE: SOLUTIONS CAN BECOME PROBLEMS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS\nINSURANCE \n","Text":["\n   The White House conference earlier this month on mental illness\nhighlighted the Clinton administration's campaign, led by Tipper\nGore, to achieve ``parity for all'' _ requiring health insurers to\nprovide the same coverage for mental illness that they provide for\nphysical illness.
