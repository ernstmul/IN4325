Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ As jury selection began Tuesday in the second murder\ntrial of a schizophrenic man who pushed a young woman in front of a\nsubway train, attention focused on a rare tactic by his new\nlawyers: The defendant, Andrew Goldstein, stopped taking his\nanti-psychotic medication two weeks ago.\n\n   Goldstein, 30, sat calmly and attentively Tuesday between his\nnew court-appointed lawyers, who advised him to go off his drugs in\nan effort to demonstrate to the jury the debilitating effects of\nhis mental illness. But some experts described the move as\ndesperate and unethical.\n\n   No one knows whether the lack of medication will have an\nincremental or sudden effect on Goldstein's state of mind over the\ncourse of the trial, which is expected to last more than a month.\n\n   Goldstein, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, is\n``very comfortable'' with the new tactic, according to his lawyers,\nwho said he was eager to testify.\n\n   ``We've talked about it,'' said Kevin Canfield, one of the\ndefense lawyers. ``He wants to testify; he does. Whether or not\nhe'll change his mind, I don't know.''\n\n   The move adds another twist to a high-profile case that has\nexposed the inadequacies of the state's mental health system.\nGoldstein, who has cycled in and out of mental institutions for\nmore than a decade, has admitted that he pushed Kendra Webdale to\nher death on Jan. 3, 1999, but has said he was not responsible\nbecause of his schizophrenia. His first trial, in November, ended\nwith the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction.\n\n   Taking a mentally ill defendant off anti-psychotic medication\nduring a trial is an unusual legal tactic that divides lawyers and\npsychiatrists. Doctors currently treating Goldstein at Bellevue\nHospital Center strongly oppose taking him off his medication, his\ndefense lawyers said.\n\n   Others were also skeptical. ``It seems irresponsible to take a\nman off medication to produce some kind of dramatic effect before a\njury,'' said Richard Uviller, a Columbia University law professor.\n``A lawyer's first duty is to preserve his client's health.''\n\n   But other experts said it was an ugly but necessary step. Dr. E.\nFuller Torrey, an expert on schizophrenia who heads the Stanley\nResearch Foundation in Bethesda, Md., said he had intentionally\ngiven homeless mentally ill patients less medication than they\nneeded before court competency hearings to keep them from being put\nback onto the street.\n\n   ``If I were his lawyer, I would argue for the same thing,'' he\nsaid. ``If I were Andrew Goldstein, I would want the jury to see\nhow psychotic I could be.''\n\n   Torrey said it was not clear whether allowing a mentally ill\nperson to suffer a breakdown causes long-term damage, but he said a\nbreakdown would surely be harrowing for Goldstein. ``I've never\nseen anyone with schizophrenia who enjoyed being in a psychotic\nstate,'' he said.\n\n   The tactic, like the insanity defense itself, is extremely rare,\naccording to legal experts. Lawyers for Russell E. Weston Jr., a\nmentally ill man accused of killing two guards in a shooting\nrampage at the U.S. Capitol in July 1998, refused to put him on\nanti-psychotic medication. Subsequently, a judge ruled him\nincompetent to stand trial for murder and committed him to a mental\ninstitution. But in other cases, judges have forced defendants to\ntake their medications.\n\n   In the Goldstein case, Justice Carol Berkman of state Supreme\nCourt in Manhattan has said she would allow Goldstein to stop\ntaking his medication for as long as he appears competent to stand\ntrial. If he appears not to understand his surroundings, she ruled,\nhe will be forcibly given his medication.\n\n   Goldstein showed no signs of disorientation during Tuesday's\ncourt proceedings, briskly answering a series of routine questions\nfrom the judge. In fact, he appeared more alert than he had during\nhis first trial, when he was fully medicated.\n\n   Odd behavior by Goldstein in front of the jury should not\ntechnically affect his case, legal experts say. The jury will be\ninstructed to judge Goldstein's state of mind at the time he pushed\nWebdale, a young woman from Buffalo, not his state of mind during\nthe trial.\n\n   But legal experts said juries in insanity defense cases are\nknown to go with their inner sense of whether or not a defendant is\nunsound or just faking it. Several jurors in Goldstein's first\ntrial said they noted his demeanor in the courtroom, which they\nsaid appeared normal.\n\n   If neither side presents new evidence in the second trial, an\nappearance by Goldstein on the witness stand could be pivotal.\nCanfield said he was unsure whether his client would actually take\nthe stand, warning that prosecutors could ``destroy'' Goldstein on\ncross-examination. But the defense may gamble that the image of a\nfrightened and disoriented mentally ill defendant is their best\nhope.\n\n   Paul F. Stavis, director of the Center for Law and Psychiatry at\nGeorge Mason School of Law in Arlington, Va., said putting any\ndefendant on the witness stand is an unpredictable tactic.
