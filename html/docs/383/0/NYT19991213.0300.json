Many lost even that distinction\nwhen groundskeepers in the 1960s yanked up the stakes and cast them\ninto thick underbrush. That made it impossible to identify the\npatients, because the hospital failed to keep records of the burial\nplots, though it detailed how many sheets were cleaned and how many\nbeans were harvested in its gardens.\n\n   It wasn't until the 1980s that deceased patients merited\nheadstones in the hospital's newest cemetery.\n\n   ``Unknown humans, shunned when living, deprived of their very\nnames in death _ and literally only known to God'' is how Joe\nIngram, the hospital's lead attendant for 50 years, described the\npatients in a historical account titled ``But for the Grace of\nGod.''\n\n   For Georgia advocates for the mentally ill, the markers are a\nsilent reminder of one of modern medicine's darkest corners. As\nU.S. Surgeon General David Satcher on Monday unveiled a historic\nreport on the mental health of Americans, advocates noted that the\nstatus of mentally ill Georgians is much improved from what it once\nwas, thanks to scientific research, better medical treatment,\nbulldog advocacy and strong legislation.\n\n   ``Many, many good things have happened recently to help\nGeorgia's consumers,'' said Cynthia Wainscott, executive director\nof the National Mental Health Association of Georgia. ``We are\ndefinitely seeing improvements.''\n\n   But people with mental illnesses still encounter plenty of\nproblems and an abiding social stigma that victims of other\nillnesses don't face, advocates note. Public and political\nattention to mental health issues has not kept pace with growing\nattention to AIDS, cancer, heart disease and other physical\nillnesses.\n\n   In addition, the Georgia Department of Human Resources' budget\nfor mental health services, which include programs for mental\nretardation and substance abuse, has been reduced by 11 percent _ a\ntotal of more than $30 million _ over the past four years. The\nstate still doesn't offer enough residential and community day\nprograms, advocates say, with many of the mentally ill simply\nlanding in homeless shelters, hospitals or jails. And when surveyed\nthis year, more than 300 Georgia mental health care users and their\nfamily members gave community mental health services an average\ngrade of ``D'' when asked to rank the quality of care.\n\n   ``The wonderful thing about the (surgeon general's) report is it\nis an answer to our cry for attention,'' said Shannon Scheels, the\nGeorgia executive director of the National Alliance for the\nMentally Ill. ``Mental illness is real, it can be treated and there\nis new hope for the future. If we had any complaints, it would only\nbe why did this acknowledgement take so long?''\n\n   Until this decade, Scheels said, mental illness was not\nroutinely recognized as a biological condition, but rather\nsomething akin to a character flaw. An abundance of scientific and\nmedical research in recent decades has challenged that view, with\nmany studies linking mental illnesses to brain function and\nchemistry.\n\n   But while science has shown that early diagnosis and treatment,\nranging from drugs to counseling and other therapies, can be very\neffective in combating mental illness, the traditional stigma\nassociated with mental problems persists. And while treatments for\nheart disease and cancer are routinely covered by insurers and\ngovernment agencies, they rarely pay for mental health care with\nthe same loosened purse strings.\n\n   Significant strides made In recent years, Georgians have made\nsignificant strides in gaining equality in treatment.\n\n   Two years ago, the Legislature enacted a parity act. Under that\nlaw, if an employer offers mental health benefits, they must be\nequal to other medical coverage. For example, if there's a $1\nmillion lifetime benefit for traditional medical coverage, the same\nmust exist for mental health coverage. But the law is limited: Like\nother states' parity acts, it does not apply to companies that are\nself-insured, meaning it doesn't protect workers for most large\ncorporations.\n\n   Also, Medicaid began to offer its members access to newer\nmedications, under new federal regulations. Now, doctors who don't\nprescribe the latest drugs, which have fewer side effects, must\nexplain why.\n\n   And Georgia is cited as a national model for its ``20 by 2000''\nprogram. The program was designed to get 20 percent of people with\nmental illnesses or retardation who attend state-sponsored day\nprograms into jobs, such as sales representatives, clerks,\nreceptionists or drivers, said Larry Fricks, director of the Office\nof Consumer Relations in the Department of Human Resources' mental\nhealth division. This year, that equals more than 4,000 Georgians\nwith mental disabilities.\n\n   Fricks, who himself was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, also\nknown as manic-depression, in 1989, told his story of struggle with\nmental illness in Washington on Monday, as part of the surgeon\ngeneral's press conference. ``People used to think if you had a\nmental illness, you couldn't work,'' Fricks said. ``We've learned,\nwith the proper medication, work is a treatment, and you'll have\nfewer symptoms and move into crisis less frequently.''\n\n   In the past decade, the state also has shifted its resources.\nTraditionally, the bulk of state money for mental health has been\nspent on hospital care, which served almost 20,000 patients last\nyear. Now, most funds are being spent on community programs, with\nmore than 23,000 participating in day programs and almost 24,000\nliving in state-supported residential programs. Thirteen regional\nboards also oversee the 212 community centers' activities, with\nhalf of those boards including consumer advocates and patients'\nfamily members. Problems still abound\n\n   But some advocates say that daily life remains a challenge for\nGeorgians with mental illness and their families.\n\n   ``It all looks so much better on paper and in theory than it\nsounds when you answer our statewide helpline and hear the problems\non the other end,'' Sheels said.\n\n   Treating the mentally ill often involves a complicated network\nof caseworkers, medication, therapy and support systems that extend\nfar beyond clinic walls. Often, agencies and individuals are simply\nasked to do too much with too little funding or resources, experts\nsay. Too often, they say, the mentally ill are discharged from\nhospitals too soon or released from jail without any treatment.\nBecause there is such a scarcity of community programs, those most\nin need of care often become homeless or repeatedly return to\nhospitals and jails.\n\n   Scheels said one indicator of the need is the calls taken at\nNAMI's statewide helpline. More than half of callers are seeking\ncommunity support. And she points to a NAMI survey about\nsatisfaction with community mental health services. On nine factors\n_ ranging from housing to vocational rehabilitation to case\nmanagement _ respondents gave an average score of 1.75 on a 1-to-5\nscale, with 1 being the lowest grade.\n\n   But advocates say progress is being made, with efforts under way\nto fix the wrongs _ even the historic ones. Last week, the\nSmithsonian Inst in Washington asked Georgia officials to\nlet it use one of the iron stakes from Central State Hospital,\nalong with a description of the person it represents, as part of a\ndisplay celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Americans With\nDisabilities Act.\n\n   And last year, the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network began\ntracking down Central State patient names and burial locations _ a\nmammoth task considering that not only were numbered markers tossed\naside, but the same numbers were often used and then reused for\ndifferent people.\n\n   The group also hopes to erect a bronze angel to guard over the\ngraves. ``And to remind society,'' Fricks said, ``to never, ever\nallow something like this to happen again.''\n\n   Diane Lore writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ In six cemeteries at Central State Hospital in\nMilledgeville, Ga., _ once known as the Georgia Lunatic Asylum _\nalmost 30,000 mentally ill patients buried in the first half of\nthis century finally have achieved equality in death.\n","\n   They were equally nameless, with only numbered iron stakes and\nmetal discs marking their graves.
