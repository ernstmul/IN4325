(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By YVONNE ABRAHAM  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ Two decades ago, life started to fall apart\nfor Elizabeth Pykosz.\n\n   In 1978, she was 21 and happy, playing bass guitar in a country\nband, living a life with few burdens. Then, suddenly and\ninexplicably, the happiness drained away, and in its place arose a\ntide of depression that no amount of psychiatric treatment, no\ncombination of psychotropic drugs, nor any of her 10 suicide\nattempts could force back down.\n\n   No matter what her doctors tried, she just deteriorated. She\ntried to keep up with her painting, but she seemed to be losing her\nskill at that, too. And she was mystified, with no idea why she had\nsuddenly sunk so low.\n\n   Two years ago, Pykosz, now 42, discovered there was a physical\ncause for her illness: Lyme disease.\n\n   Though the most common symptoms of Lyme disease _ rashes,\nlethargy, joint pain _ are well known by now, the mental effects of\nadvanced Lyme disease, which some doctors believe include anxiety,\nmemory loss, depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and extreme\naggression, are still a matter of heated contention.\n\n   Awareness has grown since the disease, carried by deer ticks and\nespecially prevalent on Cape Cod and the islands, was first\ndiscovered in the late 1970s. More and more patients are being\ncorrectly diagnosed and treated with antibiotics to kill the\nbacteria before it does irreparable damage.\n\n   But advocates say those who suffer the mental effects of\nadvanced Lyme disease have been left behind. Their illness, missed\nin its early stages, was allowed to worsen until the infection\nreached their brains.\n\n   Doctors estimate there are thousands of patients like Pykosz,\nsuffering crippling psychiatric problems and taking heavy doses of\npsychotropic drugs, not knowing that Lyme has caused their illness\nor that they might be helped with antibiotics.\n\n   ``If I'd been diagnosed earlier, all of this could have been\navoided,'' Pykosz said of her years of psychiatric illness. ``I've\ngone through an awful lot, and it makes me mad.''\n\n   Patients like Pykosz, say their advocates, are stranded on the\nfrontier in a war against a disease that is still mysterious.\n\n   But they're also caught in a crossfire between those who believe\nLyme disease is widespread and those who believe Lyme disease has\nbecome the disease du jour, overdiagnosed and overtreated with\ndangerous doses of antibiotics. While one group of doctors sees a\nclear connection between the illness and psychiatric symptoms,\nanother believes the connection is tenuous at best and that\npsychiatrists may be harming mentally ill patients with\nantibiotics.\n\n   ``I think in all too many cases what's being called psychiatric\ndisease due to Lyme disease is not and that other forms of\ntreatment than prolonged antibiotic therapy would be more effective\nfor these people,'' said Dr. Allen Steere, chief of rheumatology\nand director of the Lyme Disease program at New England Medical\nCenter.\n\n   Those who care for Lyme patients with psychiatric symptoms say\nSteere refuses to acknowledge a public health crisis.\n\n   ``What we're starting to learn should be a huge wake-up call to\nall mental health professionals,'' said Dr. Paul K. Ling, a\npsychologist and advocate for patients with mental symptoms of Lyme\ndisease. ``Otherwise, a whole lot of needless human suffering will\nbe the result.''\n\n   Some doctors liken the situation to earlier thinking on other\nphysical illnesses that were first thought to be psychological.\n\n   ``There were people in insane asylums who were found to have\nthyroid disease and syphilis and lupus,'' said Dr. Sam T. Donta,\nprofessor of medicine at Boston University. ``History tells us\nthere are causes for these illnesses. They're not due to evil\nspirits.''\n\n   Greg, who asked that his last name not be used, grew up near\nLyme, Conn., the town for which the disease is named. He said he\nhad battled mental illness since childhood, but that his problems\nworsened a decade ago, when he became a stockbroker. He was\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he also complained of\nexhaustion and joint pain.\n\n   ``No one ever questioned my diagnosis; no one ever tested me for\nanything physical. It's amazing,'' he said.\n\n   Several years ago, he tested positive for Lyme disease. If he\nhad been correctly diagnosed earlier, Greg said, his illness would\nhave been ``a bump in the road of this life, instead of going off a\ncliff.''\n\n   Though he conceded that he still feels paranoid, Greg said he\nhas been much improved since he stopped other medications, opting\nfor antibiotics alone. He now holds a part-time job doing\nmaintenance work.\n\n   Pykosz said that since she began antibiotic treatment for her\nillness and jettisoned her other medications _ at one point she was\ntaking 14 medications a day _ she has been vastly improved. She\nsaid she doesn't think of suicide any more, and her paintings,\nwhich years ago hung in several Cape galleries, are finding\nshowings once more.\n\n   Both Pykosz and Greg have medical charts as thick as phone books\nand have taken a long succession of drugs that, they say, left them\nin a permanent fog. They also lived with the stigma of mental\nillness.\n\n   ``To have people around you shamed by your mental state, and\nthen to find it's a physical thing, it's very liberating,'' Greg\nsaid. ``It's so much easier to accept the fact that some parasite\nmade me ill. It gives me a chance.''\n\n   Nobody can say how many other patients like them there might be.\nAccording to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, more\nthan 700 cases of Lyme disease were reported last year, but\nadvocates say that figure is far short of the actual number, since\nsome people carry the disease without knowing it and not all\npatients who have it test positive using the current tests.\n\n   Some psychiatrists say the number of Lyme patients with mental\nsymptoms runs into the thousands: Dr. Robert Bransfield, a\npsychiatrist and associate director of the Riverview Medical Center\nin Red Bank, N.J., another Lyme hot spot, said he has seen a\nthousand of them.\n\n   Advocates argue that there should be an aggressive public\nawareness campaign to educate doctors and the public about the\nhidden side of Lyme disease. Ling and his colleages also want the\nstate Department of Mental Health to start screening its clients.\nBlood tests for the disease cost less than $100, but brain scans,\nwhich some psychiatrists say are more reliable, cost more than\n$2,000.\n\n   Others say that is alarmist.\n\n   Steere, who first named the disease in 1978, does not see such\nstrong connections between the disease and mental illness. He will\ngo only so far as to say that Lyme disease can give rise to ``a\nsubtle neuropsychiatric picture in which subtle memory deficit is\nthe most common manifestation.''\n\n   ``A lot of what has been described as Lyme disease, and\nattributed to Lyme disease, would not stand up to the scrutiny'' of\npeer review, he said.\n\n   Unfortunately, it's a debate without clear answers, and the\nargument promises to stretch on for years.\n\n   Meanwhile, advocates say, patients like Pykosz will get lost in\nthe system.\n\n   ``I don't know if they're filling up mental institutions,'' said\nDonta. ``But there are more ordinary people who are walking around\nwho have those symptoms and have gotten themselves in a vicious\ndownward spiral and have just accepted that it's their lot to be\ndepressed.''\n","Headline":"\nLYME DISEASE'S HIDDEN VICTIMS \n","Text":["\n   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ Two decades ago, life started to fall apart\nfor Elizabeth Pykosz.\n","\n   In 1978, she was 21 and happy, playing bass guitar in a country\nband, living a life with few burdens.
