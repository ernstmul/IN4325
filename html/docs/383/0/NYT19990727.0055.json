Star-Tribune   \n\n   Last month, the U.S. House passed H.R. 1501, the Juvenile\nJustice Reform Act of 1999. The bill contains an amendment authored\nby Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, that strips children in jails of\nprotections against physical or sexual abuse.\n\n   This isn't the first time that Congress has shown its nasty side\nin regard to children. Last year the Senate passed a bill that\nwould have allowed young teenagers to be jailed with adults _\ndespite the overwhelming evidence that when young people are\nconfined in the same facility with adults, they are beaten and\nraped, sometimes killed, and too often commit suicide under such\nconditions. Fortunately, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender\nAct, S.10, never became law.\n\n   In this latest abomination called a reform, section 110\neliminates any consent decree ``that provides for remedies relating\nto prison conditions'' and was entered into before the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) was passed in 1995. PLRA was passed to\nmake it difficult for inmates or relatives to sue a prison system\nfor violations of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n\n   Typically, in a consent decree involving incarcerated children,\nparents sue a county or state in order to stop the jailing of teens\nwith adults or to end some mistreatment of imprisoned teens. The\ncounty or state agrees to no longer jail children with adults or\nagrees to end some ill-conceived method of dealing with children in\njails _ without admitting wrongdoing. A consent decree is like a\ncontract between the two parties.\n\n   The Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice provides a striking\nexample of a consent decree that would be wiped out by H.R. 1501.\n\n   Rita Horn's 15-year-old son Robbie was held in Oldham County\njail in LaGrange, Ky., for a minor infraction. He took off his\nshirt, wrapped one sleeve around his neck and the other around the\nbars of his cell and hanged himself. Rita Horn sued the county for\njailing juveniles with adults. Records show that nearly 1,400\nchildren were held in the county jail in a four-year period _ most\nfor minor offenses. As a result of the lawsuit, in 1985, the Oldham\nCounty officials signed a consent decree in which they agreed to\nnever again hold children in the jail.\n\n   If DeLay has his way, Oldham County can start jailing juveniles\nwith adults once more. With the sad predictable results.\n\n   In a July 20 news release, Mark Soler, president of the Youth\nLaw Center in Washington, D.C., commented: ``The DeLay provisions\nwould immediately wipe out protections in scores of counties around\nAmerica where children have been abused and mistreated in adult\njails and juvenile facilities.''\n\n   The list of abuses curtailed or ended by these consent decrees\nstagger the imagination: Children in juvenile detention in\nPhiladelphia were regularly beaten with paddles and chains. Unruly\nchildren in juvenile detention in Hannibal, Mo., were strapped to\nboards and leaned against a wall _ sometimes upside down. Children\nin state institutions in Arizona were stripped naked, hands and\nfeet tied to the four corners of bed frames and kept in solitary\nconfinement for days at a time. In Oklahoma, children in one state\njuvenile correctional institution were handcuffed, hogtied and\nbeaten in the dungeon-like ``punishment unit.''\n\n   If DeLay has his way, all these obscene practices can begin once\nagain.\n\n   The DeLay amendment, however, raises a significant legal\nquestion. Can a law passed by Congress override consent decrees or\nagreements worked out between counties or states and those\nindividuals who sued? Can a federal law declare null and void a\nstate's agreement over how a state facility will be run? It's\ndoubtful. And if the DeLay amendment becomes part of the law, it\nwill lead to more litigation over this constitutional issue.\n\n   It's ironic that the GOP flies the banner of local control, yet\nthis amendment, authored by a Republican representative, would\ncompletely destroy it.\n\n   In response to DeLay's amendment to the House juvenile justice\nbill, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., offered an amendment to the\nSenate's Commerce and Judiciary Appropriations bill that would\nprotect children from abuse in all the nation's jails and\ncorrectional facilities.\n\n   On July 22, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent\nPsychiatry, the Children's Defense Fund and 13 other organizations\nsent a letter to the U.S. Senate in support of Wellstone's\namendment.\n\n   The letter states, in part: ``The U.S. Department of Justice\nissued a report earlier this year documenting widespread inhumane\nand abusive conditions for children with mental illness in jails\nand juvenile facilities. The report cited cases of extreme physical\nabuse and neglect, including lengthy periods of isolation and the\nuse of tear gas as chemical restraints. ... The Wellstone amendment\nwould allow federal courts to protect children, especially those\nwith mental illness, from danger and mistreatment.''\n\n   Nevertheless, the Wellstone amendment was defeated.\n\n   The House bill now goes to a House-Senate conference committee\nalong with another version of a juvenile crime bill which the\nSenate passed (S. 254).\n\n   The Senate bill dismantles the federal mandate to study and\nattempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority\nconfinement (DMC). In every state of the union, teens of color are\ntreated more severely by law enforcement and prison officials.\n\n   Recent news stories in the Baltimore Sun document that in\nMaryland mentally ill delinquents are treated differently,\ndepending upon race.\n\n   White teens who are mentally ill and have committed crimes are\nplaced in residential centers that specialize in treating mental\nillness. Teens of other races who have committed similar offenses\nand have similar mental problems are locked up in juvenile jails or\nstate training schools and given tranquilizers or psychotropic\ndrugs.\n\n   The Sun also reported that last year's crime figures show that\none out of every three white delinquents is sentenced to\nconfinement in a treatment center, while one of six black\ndelinquents goes to a treatment center. In Baltimore, only one out\nof nine black delinquents was sentenced to treatment.\n\n   Maryland's Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, according to the\nBaltimore Sun, has ordered officials of the appropriate agencies to\nfind out why a much higher percentage of black mentally ill\njuvenile delinquents than their white counterparts are sentenced to\njail instead of treatment. ``Race,'' she is quoted as saying,\n``must never play a role in placement or providing treatment to\njuveniles.''\n\n   True, but unless the DMC mandate is kept alive, the racist\npolicies will continue _ blindly.\n\n   A few members of the House and Senate in conference committee\nwill decide which provisions of the two juvenile crime bills will\nbe kept and which shucked in order to fashion the legislation that\nwill then be taken to a vote in both houses.
