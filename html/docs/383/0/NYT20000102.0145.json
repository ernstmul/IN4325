Times News Service clients)  \n By JODIE SNYDER  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX - Fewer and fewer people in the Phoenix area are\nentering the state's mental health system under the category of\n``seriously mentally ill.''\n\n   A crackdown in eligibility by state officials is swamping mental\nhealth advocates - paid by the state to police the system - and\nforcing advocates to turn people away, a possible violation of\nstate law.\n\n   Under an increasingly rigid process, even people ordered by\nSuperior Court judges to be hospitalized or treated are not being\nconsidered seriously mentally ill, or SMI.\n\n   People previously considered SMI by Arizona have been turned\ndown, as have people who have qualified for Social Security\ndisability and those diagnosed as SMI by psychiatrists of Value\nOptions, a state-funded, bu private, mental-health provider.\n\n   SMI status means patients can receive medications for free or at\na greatly reduced rate. They may be able to get onto a list for\nsubsidized housing. They also can get added help through the court\nmonitor's office.\n\n   The Arizona Department of H.alth Services says it realizes rules\nhave been rigorously applied, but their intent is to prevent fraud.\n\n   However, a monitor appointed by Maricopa County Superior Court\nto oversee mental-health issues says the new process has been\noverzealous to the point of violating state laws.\n\n   The department disagrees with that assessment, but it\nnevertheless is making some fixes, said Michael Franczak, the state\nagency's head of SMI services.\n\n     Improvements can't come soon enough for Mary Ann Black,\ndirector of advocacy services for Advocates of the Seriously\nMentally Ill, a non-profit agency paid by the state to be a\npatients' rights watchdog.\n\n     Because advocates are getting flooded with calls from people\ntrying to get into the system, it's difficult for them to work on\nother issues, Black said.\n\n   In November, the office got 58 calls from people recently denied\nSMI status. In the past, they have received as few as a dozen.\n\n     Black and other mental health advocates started hearing more\ncomplaints when Value Options, a Tennessee-based corporation, began\nin February as the managed-care company for mental-health services\nin Maricopa County.\n\n   For example, in May 1997, 514 people applied for SMI services at\nValue Options' predecessor ComCare. Of those, 180 were approved. In\ncontrast, during May 1999, 368 applied and 62 were approved.\n\n   On average, about 450 people apply every month to be considered\nSMI. Those seeking help may come by themselves or be referred by\nphysicians, the jails or homeless shelters.\n\n   A Value Options employee interviews them and sends their\ninformation to a Value Options psychiatrist, who determines whether\nthey meet the criteria.\n\n   The state's Franczak believes that many of the Phoenix area's\n12,000 seriously mentally ill don't belong on the rolls. Many were\nlured into the system because of the benefits, especially as funds\nfor less-serious mental illness and substance-abuse programs dried\nup.\n\n   ``SMI is a special club and a lot of people want to belong to\nit,'' he said.\n\n   ``There is no way in hell that some of these guys are SMI.''\n\n   The state spends about $11,000 per year on each seriously\nmentally ill person in the system. That's not enough to meet their\nneeds, and the money shouldn't be wasted on people who don't need\nit, he said.\n\n     One of the most contentious issues between the state and the\nadvocates has been ``dual-diagnosis'' patients, those who have\nsubstance-abuse problems as well as mental illness.\n\n     Franczak agrees that the state has been ``pretty rigid'' and\nValue Options has been ``very rigid'' in those cases, in some cases\nsaying that if a person has both problems, then it's probably\nalcohol or drug abuse - not mental illness - that is the overriding\nissue.\n\n   The state now is looking at a plan in which people with both\nsymptoms will be allowed 30 to 60 days of counseling before Value\nOptions tries to determine their status.\n\n   The state also wants to give patients more time to get their\nmedical records. Current policy requires a decision to be made in\nseven days after the application is turned in. Frequently, people\ncan't meet the deadline because their records are out of state.\nWithout those, people can't prove they have a long-standing illness\nand they are denied.\n\n   Value Options also plans to improve how people collect data from\nprospective patients.\n\n   Anne Ronan, an attorney with the Arizona Center for Disability\nLaw, said she was glad that the state recognized the problem, but\nit should change its overall policy rather than make minor fixes.\n\n   ``They should be looking at ways to bring people into the system\nrather than reasons for excluding (them) from services,'' she said.\n\n     People who have been turned down can always reapply, Franczak\nsaid.\n\n   But increasingly, they have been going to people like Black and\nher advocates to fight their case through three levels of\nadministrative and court hearings.\n\n   Black said her office doesn't have the staff to prepare for the\nhearings.\n\n   As it is now, with two full-time employees and five part-timers,\nBlack says she doesn't have the staff mandated by state law. She\nhas two part-timers to handle 11,000 Maricopa County clients, while\nthe state requires one advocate for every 2,500 patients.\n\n   One of the reasons for the short staffings is that the\nadvocates' agency gets $87,000 a year. When the state ran the\nadvocates' office, instead of contracting out the services, it had\na $500,000 budget, Black said.\n\n   Black is trying to negotiate for additional staff.
