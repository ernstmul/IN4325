Times News Service clients)  \n BY MAUREEN WEST  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n     \n(PHOENIX) - Tommy Sapien was an altar boy who sold drugs.\n\n   But he had his limits: He wouldn't sell at school or on church\ngrounds.\n\n   ``I know God sees you everywhere, but if I sold them there, I\nwould go to hell for sure,'' he said.\n\n   So, Tommy would walk down the street and find some other kids to\nsell to, little kids who would give him $1 for a reefer.\n\n   That was five years ago.\n\n   Tommy is 16 now, and he's clean for the first time in years.\nHe's been through nine months of drug counseling, group therapy and\ndrug testing after being arrested for possessing drugs and a\nfirearm.\n\n   He graduated from juvenile drug court earlier this month, and\nhe's working on his GED at Rio Salado Community College and\nthinking about learning a trade.\n\n   Counselors suggested that Tommy try food preparation or machine\noperation. He may, but it doesn't sound very exciting to a kid who\nused to carry around two phones and a pager, made hundreds,\nsometimes thousands, of dollars a week and bought his girlfriends\nexpensive gifts.\n\n   The truth is Tommy liked being a drug dealer.\n\n   ``I liked the way people look at you, like you have money.\nMostly the girls,'' he said.\n\n   ``I liked having a lawyer call me (to buy). People would like to\nsee me show up. I was somebody. I think I was more addicted to\nselling the drugs than to taking them.''\n\n   But he took plenty.\n\n   His system was so full of drugs that it was six months before he\ncould pass a drug test after his arrest. It took that long for the\ndrugs to clear his system.   \nGETTING THE HABIT\n\n   Unlike many kids who use drugs, Tommy didn't come from a poor or\nbroken home, or one where the parents used drugs. His mother is a\nlegal secretary; his father is a construction foreman.\n\n   Tommy didn't need drugs to escape from a tough life. Drugs just\nseeped into his life and took over.\n\n   When he was in fifth grade, he bought a marijuana joint with $2\nin lunch money from an elementary school friend whose parents sold\ndrugs.\n\n   ``I saw it in the movies,'' he said. ``I saw it in a friend's\nhouse. I heard stories about how it made you feel like you were\nfloating.''\n\n   He liked that feeling, so he bought more. Soon, he was\nencouraging his friends to try it. Dealers began calling him and\nasking if he wanted in on the action.\n\n   ``The whole group was following me. I was the leader,'' he said.\n``It made me feel good.''\n\n   Tommy sold drugs through seventh and eighth grades while\nattending a Catholic school, and he continued selling through a\nquick succession of high schools: Tolleson, Peoria, West Phoenix\nand North.\n\n   He hid cocaine in his bedroom and buried a huge stash of\nmarijuana under the floor so his parents wouldn't smell it.\n\n   The day he graduated from his school's Drug Abuse Resistance and\nEducation program, he was using and dealing drugs. He and his\nfriends thought DARE was a big joke.\n\n   His parents said they noticed changes in their son. But for\nthree years, they couldn't admit to themselves that he had a\nproblem.\n\n   They did suspect that his friends were gang members and drug\nusers, so they decided to enroll Tommy in a Catholic junior high\nschool, thinking he'd be safe there.\n\n   When they got several anonymous calls saying, ``Your son is\nselling drugs to my son,'' they told themselves it couldn't be\ntrue. Tommy was playing sports and couldn't be high, they\nrationalized. Tommy is smarter than that, they thought.\n\n   By the time he was in the ninth grade, Tommy was constantly high\nor drunk, and almost always in trouble.\n\n   He rarely went to class, and he failed every subject. In two\nyears of high school, he earned no academic credits.\n\n   One day, in the fall of his freshman year, his parents found him\npassed out in his bedroom. They couldn't deny the truth any longer:\nTommy needed help.\n\n   They put him into a 30-day detox program at Charter Hospital in\nPhoenix. They were lucky; they had health insurance that covered\nresidential treatment.\n\n   But Tommy was far from ready for it.\n\n   He was angry.\n\n   ``My friends and I had this joke that rehab was for quitters,''\nhe said.\n\n   On visiting days, his mom and dad went to see him. His mother\ndid the talking; his dad just looked at him with a hurt expression.\n\n   His mother attended family therapy sessions with Tommy. She\ncried when she learned that he had tried every drug but heroin. He\nwas only 14.\n\n   Fifteen days into the program, Tommy had cold sweats, shakes and\nnausea. He couldn't sleep. His mother wouldn't OK any medications\nto make the withdrawal easier; she wanted him to feel the pain so\nhe wouldn't try drugs again.\n\n   She thought the nightmare would end when Tommy completed the\nprogram. She thought she'd have her son back again.\n\n   ``The truth?'' Tommy said. ``I was looking for the next high.''   \nDEALING IN TREATMENT   \nWhen Tommy left the hospital, he went into Pathways, a private\nafter-care program for teenagers who are addicts. The teens live at\nhome or in halfway houses, get counseling and go to a Pathways\nschool.\n\n   His parents were told not to worry about him because he would be\naround ``kids who were also trying to stay sober _ they would help\neach other.''\n\n   That's not what Tommy discovered.\n\n   ``There were more drugs in Pathways than I ever imagined,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   He got in on the action, selling LSD, PCP and other\nhallucinogenics to other kids there. And he picked up a new\naddiction, cigarettes.\n\n   In a matter of weeks, he had been caught twice using and dealing\nand got kicked out of the program.\n\n   So, he went back to a public high school, where, he said, the\ndemand for drugs was high.\n\n   ``I made so much money. One day I made $2,000, and, over a\ntwo-week period, $4,000 or $5,000,'' he said.\n\n   He spent a lot of it on girls. Some were drawn to him, but\nothers wouldn't have anything to do with him.\n\n   ``One girl told me I was ugly,'' he said. ``Not because of my\nlooks, but because of my attitude. I thought about it, but not\nenough to change who I was.''\n\n   Tommy bought his drugs from an older guy who got his supply from\nMexico or South America, Tommy isn't sure which.\n\n   He would give his supplier proceeds from the sales as he made\nthem. Then he would get his share back, usually $4,000 or $5,000\nfor every $20,000 in sales.   \nARREST CHANGES THINGS\n\n   Tommy said he always took along a gun, usually his dad's, when\nhe picked up drugs.\n\n   In the fall of 1998, on a run to get a supply of drugs, he and a\nfriend were arrested in Glendale near Bethany Home Road and 61st\nAvenue. He had his dad's gun with him and about 20 grams of drugs.\n\n   Until that day, 15-year-old Tommy had been arrested only for\nbreaking curfew. He now faced a Class 6 felony for possession of a\nfirearm, a Class 5 felony for possession of marijuana and drug\nparaphernalia, as well as three misdemeanors, including curfew\nviolation and carrying a gun without a license.\n\n   When the police called his home from the precinct station to say\nthat he could be bailed out, his mom told police to take her only\nchild to jail.\n\n   The police tried to tell her that he was cooperative during the\narrest and could be bailed out.\n\n   ``Take him,'' she said in tears.\n\n   He spent the next few weeks in the Durango Juvenile Detention\nCenter in southwest Phoenix, then was placed under house arrest at\nhome.\n\n   He couldn't leave the house, but he still managed to sell drugs\nand get high. He would go out to the side yard, where drugs would\nbe dropped off; then teenagers would stop by the house to buy them.\n\n   ``I had too much time on my hands,'' he said.\n\n   As part of his probation, Tommy was in the non-profit TASC\n(Treatment Assessment Screening Center) program where he had to\nattend counseling and have drug tests three times a week. After a\ncouple of months of failing tests, he was charged with violating\nprobation.\n\n   Early last year he was placed in the HIP, or High Impact\nProgram, run through the Durango Jail, which includes a tough\nregimen of exercise.\n\n   ``They take you running until you get sick, and you're detoxing\nat the same time,'' Tommy said.\n\n   When the five-day program was over, an exhausted Tommy was\nreleased and put on a waiting list for the Maricopa County's\nJuvenile Drug Court, one of three now operating in the Valley.\n\n   The drug court has become a model for other programs across the\ncountry. Judge John Foreman, who started the program, has seen it\nchange teens' fates. One of three addicts who graduate relapses,\nbut that still leaves two others who haven't, he said.\n\n   Teens, often accompanied by parents, report once a week to\ncourt, attend counseling and do community service. If they don't,\nthere are swift and tough penalties.\n\n   But when a probation officer came to his house to interview\nTommy for the program, he was high.\n\n   The drug court turned him down. But Missy Becker, juvenile\nservices administrator at TASC, fought to get him in. He had an\n``attitude'' and was a troublemaker in group counseling sessions,\nbut she believed in him.\n\n   ``He was honest about his drug use and eventually about his\nhopelessness,'' she said.\n\n   Tommy got into the program, but his troubles weren't over.\n\n   When he made his first appearance last spring before Judge\nForeman, Tommy lied and said he was straight. Foreman ordered a\ndrug test on him, then placed him in detention for the weekend when\nit came back dirty.\n\n   Tommy was so high that the levels were off the scale.\n\n   ``I was amazed and proud that the levels were so high,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   But neither did he want to be sent to the Arizona Juvenile\nDepartment of Corrections, where he would be locked up until he was\n18.\n\n   The next week, the level of drugs in Tommy's system began to\ndrop. By September, he was clean.\n\n   ``It's not easy, even now. There are always cravings,'' he said,\nboth for drugs and money.\n\n   ``I made so much money, too much money,'' he added, playing with\na gold chain his mother bought for him because he can no longer\nafford to buy things like that on his own.\n\n   Tommy has slipped since beginning his rehabilitation last\nspring.\n\n   Once, he went out with friends for the evening, sipped iced\norange juice, then felt the urge for a beer. He dropped his friends\noff at home, then went to a liquor store. He drank a beer, then\nwent on a drag race down McDowell Road. For a moment, it reminded\nhim of the excitement of his earlier days.\n\n   Then he saw a policeman's red light behind him. He was caught.\n\n   The breath test showed a trace of alcohol in his bloodstream.\nHis parents were livid. His father kicked him out for the night.\n\n   He walked across the street and sat on a bus bench and thought\nabout what to do.\n\n   In the past, he said, he would have gone out and gotten high.\nBut he didn't.\n\n   ``I'm tired of drugs,'' he said.\n\n   The next morning, he went back home.\n\n   That weekend, as part of his DUI class, he saw a grisly movie\nabout drinking and driving.\n\n   ``It sunk in what could have happened if I had hit someone. It\nkept pushing me to sobriety,'' he said.\n\n   Tommy insists that he won't slip again.\n\n   ``I know there are people who want to see me succeed. I don't\nwant to let them down,'' he said.\n\n   He still gets calls from teenagers who want to buy. He tells\nthem, ``I don't deal with that anymore.''\n\n   He's thinking about his future, and he has some advice for\nparents willing to listen.\n\n   ``Kids need to be busy,'' he said. ``Keep them involved in\nsports, community service or church.
