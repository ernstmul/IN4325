Times News Service    \n\n   Child psychologists and other experts on youth violence said\nTuesday's killings in Colorado are evidence of a woeful lack of\nmental health services for young people at a time of decreasing\nfamily strength and increasing access to the tools of violence.\n\n   They also said parents, teachers and students themselves ought\nto be receiving training in the early detection of depression and\nviolent tendencies. But they added that the continuing stigma of\nmental illness, and cutbacks in health insurance due to managed\ncare, were keeping society from looking frankly at the problem.\n\n   ``The true tragedy is that America refuses to recognize that\nthere are millions of teens and children with psychological\nillnesses, which are as real as physical illnesses,'' said Dr.\nHarold Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New York\nUniversity.\n\n   He added that tests were available to spot warning signs like\ndepression and isolation even in very young children, but that few\nschools used them.\n\n   ``There is a common theme to all of the shootings of recent\nyears,'' he said. ``You have a child who has had symptoms of\naggression toward his peers, an interest in fire, cruelty to\nanimals, social isolation and many warning signs that the school\nhas ignored. Schools do vision and hearing screenings. Doesn't it\nmake sense that kindergarten teachers learn how to screen for\naggressive behavior?''\n\n   Dr. Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Columbia\nUniversity's Teachers College, agreed. ``If we were able to get\nteachers to receive even basic tips from professionals about such\nthings, we might go a long way to preventing violence, suicide and\ndrug abuse.''\n\n   In August, the federal government distributed a guide to safe\nschools that outlined ways for administrators and teachers to\nrecognize potentially violent behavior. It also suggested measures\nfor school systems to take to prevent violence.\n\n   Much emphasis was placed on tight community and family bonds to\nschools, which, some administration officials believe, result from\nsmaller school and class sizes and high academic standards.\n\n   ``We see all these issues as linked,'' said Bill Modzeleski, the\ndirector of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the federal\nDepartment of Education. ``A lot of the factors that put kids at\nrisk of using alcohol and drugs are the same as those that put them\nat risk of violent behavior.''\n\n   In Minneapolis on Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno said\nthe only way to curb violence in schools was to give children the\nsupport they needed and to train school authorities to spot\nyoungsters with potential problems.\n\n   Reno said she might push for more counselors in the nation's\nschools.\n\n   On April 1, a joint program of the departments of Education,\nJustice and Health and Human Services was announced to award more\nthan $300 million in grants to 50 communities to help prevent\nschool violence.\n\n   The grants will cover the purchase of security equipment like\nmetal detectors and will finance training for teachers,\nafter-school programs and the hiring of more mental health\nprofessionals for schools, a move welcomed by counselors and other\nmental health advocates.\n\n   Modzeleski said about 5 percent of schools use walk-through\nmetal detectors and 10 percent use hand-held devices.\n\n   While schools may decide to increase their physical security,\nmany violence experts argue that such an effort will have limited\neffectiveness.\n\n   ``The idea that metal detectors will protect us is\nshortsighted,'' said Dr. Mark Greenberg, a professor of human\ndevelopment and family studies at Pennsylvania State University.\n``Kids who want to kill will just shoot outside.''\n\n   He added that with the growing number of families in which both\nparents work, school systems needed to train teachers to be alert\nto signs of emotional instability.\n\n   Specialists are increasingly arguing that the developing field\nof threat assessment, used by the Secret Service to track potential\nassassins, can be applied to potentially violent students.\n\n   As outlined in a Secret Service handbook, such assessments\ninvolve looking for common patterns of behavior and experience,\nincluding feelings of rejection.\n\n   Bernice Berk, a psychologist at the Bank Street School for\nChildren in Manhattan, said parents needed to learn to be alert to\nthe anger and frustration of their children.\n\n   ``Long before adolescence, we need to be open to children's\nhumiliation and pain and discouragement,'' she said. ``Parents have\nto be really willing to listen to this and accept expressions of\nanger at home, whether they are tantrums or inappropriate\nlanguage.''\n\n   She added that depression, which she called very prevalent, was\nclosely related to aggression. One is anger turned toward the self;\nthe other is anger turned toward others.\n\n   A number of programs have sprung up around the country aimed at\nhelping children learn social communication and skills to cope with\nfrustration and anger.\n\n   The Committee for Children, a nonprofit organization in Seattle,\noffers a program called ``Second Step'' to teach violence\nprevention to children as young as 4, using techniques like taking\nturns and dealing with anger.
