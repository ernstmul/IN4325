Times News Service   \n\n   At 88, Nathan, a New York businessman with a sharp, clear mind,\nwas still going to work every day. Then an episode that resembled a\nministroke landed him in the hospital, where numerous medications\nwere administered.\n\n   Within days, Nathan's mind and memory had turned to mush. The\nfamily was ready to put him in a nursing home when, at a\nknowledgeable relative's request, the drug regimen was reviewed and\nseveral drugs of questionable necessity were discontinued. Nathan\nsoon returned to his previous mental state and was able to continue\nworking for several more years.\n\n   Ninety-five-year-old Anne of Boca Raton, Fla., also had a sharp\nmind and good memory until two potent drugs she was given for\nrheumatoid arthritis, along with six or seven others for related\nhealth problems, led to such severe mental deterioration that she\nbecame unable to communicate with her favorite brother. Within\nweeks of being taken off the two arthritis drugs and Valium, she\nbegan to come back to herself.\n\n   Both Nathan and Anne were the victims of polypharmacy, a\n``poisonous cocktail'' _ as some doctors put it _ of three, four or\nmore drugs that may have side effects that render the treatment\nworse than the disease.\n\n   Although there are no precise statistics on the incidence and\nconsequences of polypharmacy, experts report that it is an\nincreasingly common problem now that so many people live into their\n70s and beyond, when nagging physical discomforts and chronic\nhealth problems often arise. In various studies, 10 percent to 20\npercent of hospital admissions for older people were found to\nresult directly from adverse reactions to prescribed medications.\n\n   Causes and Consequences\n\n   In a report several years ago in The Journal of General Internal\nMedicine, Colleen A. Colley, a pharmacist, and Dr. Linda M. Lucas,\nthen both at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Ore.,\ndescribed the problem in detail and offered numerous suggestions to\nremedy it. Though polypharmacy is by no means limited to the\nelderly, they noted that twice as many medications were prescribed\nfor patients 65 and older than for younger ones, and that older\npeople used seven times as many over-the-counter drugs as the\ngeneral adult population.\n\n   Three-fourths of visits to doctors in the United States end with\na written prescription, partly the result of patients' expectations\nthat ``modern medicine should provide an antidote for every\nsymptom'' and partly to save the doctor's time, the authors wrote.\n\n   The problem of polypharmacy is now being aided and abetted by\ndirect marketing of prescription drugs to the general public and by\nthe increasing availability of and publicity for herbal and other\nnonprescription remedies with drug effects and side effects.\n\n   Many patients have two or more physicians and use multiple\npharmacies, so no one person knows every drug they are taking.\nGiven the high cost of many drugs and the lack of Medicare coverage\nfor prescriptions, many patients hoard leftover drugs and take them\non their own when symptoms return. Finally, changes in drug\nregimens, and sometimes in the physical appearance of drugs, can\nconfuse patients who may end up taking the wrong drug, too much of\nthe right one or two or more similar medications for the same\ncondition.\n\n   Polypharmacy can become a vicious cycle in which side effects\ncaused by one or more medications are ``treated'' with yet another\ndrug that has side effects of its own. And, two or more different\ndrugs taken together can sometimes interact to cause serious\ncomplications. The problem is worse in older people in part because\nthey metabolize drugs more slowly, resulting in a buildup of toxic\ndoses.\n\n   Then, too, a complicated medication regimen or the occurrence of\nside effects may result in noncompliance: the patients simply stop\ntaking the drug or take it less often than prescribed, reducing its\ntherapeutic benefit. This may prompt the doctor to increase the\ndose or prescribe yet another drug to control the problem.\n\n   In one study of patients discharged from a hospital, the more\nmedications that were prescribed, the greater was the number of\nerrors the patients made in taking them. Those discharged with six\nor more medications had an error rate of 70 percent.\n\n   There are many ways patients and their doctors can avoid the\nhazards of polypharmacy. They start with the patient _ or patient's\nadvocate _ acting as a responsible partner in his or her health\ncare. First and foremost, don't expect a drug to be the solution\nfor every symptom.\n\n   Many health problems are best treated with adjustments in diet\nand exercise habits, stress management or simple behavioral\nchanges. For example, rather than a sleeping pill to treat\ninsomnia, changes in habits like caffeine use, naps or bedtime\nroutines may solve the problem without a drug.\n\n   When any drug is prescribed, patients should insist that the\nname, purpose, dosage instructions and possible side effects,\nespecially those warranting a call to the doctor, be provided both\norally and in writing. Patients should also be told when to expect\nan improvement and, for drugs that treat hidden symptoms like\nelevated blood pressure or cholesterol, they should be kept\ninformed of progress, or lack of it, being made toward the desired\ntherapeutic goal.\n\n   At each visit to a doctor, especially one new to the patient, it\nis crucial to provide a complete list of the kinds and amounts of\nevery drug being taken, including over-the-counter medications and\nherbal remedies, which may have the same drug effects or side\neffects as a prescribed medication or may interfere with the\neffectiveness of a prescribed drug.\n\n   For example, the herb St. John's wort can impair the\neffectiveness of several important drugs, including the heart drug\ndigoxin (Lanoxin) and the antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil).\nSome experts suggest a ``brown bag'' approach, in which patients\nput all their pills, including vitamins, in a bag and bring them to\nthe doctor for review. Even if you always see the same doctor, a\nperiodic review of what you take can help prevent polypharmacy\nproblems.\n\n   When you are given a prescription and are told why, be sure to\nfill it and take it as prescribed. Noncompliance with doctor's\norders _ taking too little or too much of a prescribed drug _ is a\nmajor cause of polypharmacy. Complicated dosing schedules can also\ninterfere with compliance.\n\n   If, say, you are taking one drug four times a day, another three\ntimes a day and a third twice a day, ask the doctor if an\nadjustment can be made to reduce the chances that you might forget\nor get confused. Many drugs used for chronic health problems are\navailable in several dosage forms, including time-released, which\nmay permit a reduction to only one or two doses a day.\n\n   Unpleasant side effects also lead to noncompliance with a\nprescribed regimen. Rather than discontinuing a drug or reducing\nthe dosage on your own, tell the doctor about side effects you\ncannot tolerate; often another medication can be substituted or a\nchange can be made to solve the problem.\n\n   Finally, try to fill all your prescriptions at the same\npharmacy, where a record is kept of what you are taking.\n\n   And before buying over-the-counter or herbal remedies, check\nwith your pharmacist to see if any will interact badly with drugs\nyou are taking.\n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: AS PRESCRIPTIONS PILE UP, RISKS DO, TOO \n","Text":["\n   At 88, Nathan, a New York businessman with a sharp, clear mind,\nwas still going to work every day.
