Some\nwon't be changed, some will be changed,'' said Clarissa Wittenberg,\nan NIMH spokeswoman, in an interview Thursday.\n\n   Wittenberg added that ``there's always that possibility'' that\nsome studies could be stopped. ``At this point, every single study\nand every single patient is being evaluated.''\n\n   The Boston Globe, in a series two months ago, highlighted the\nharm done to mentally ill patients who were given drugs to induce\npsychosis, or signed up for clinical drug trials without adequate\nprotections or full informed consent. Some patients committed\nsuicide. In New York, a current controversy centers around the\ndeath of a mentally ill patient given an experimental antipsychotic\ndrug.\n\n   In addition, the journal Science is reporting that NIMH's\ndirector, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, plans to propose at a February\nmeeting a new review panel that would screen ``high risk'' human\nstudies proposed by outside researchers before NIMH funds them.\n\n   The Science article, which referred to the Globe series as a\n``devastating four-part series full of research horror stories,''\nalso said that earlier this month, the ongoing NIMH review of its\nown research program has already led to the suspension of\nenrollment of new patients in 29 of 108 clinical experiments. The\nreview has also led to a request that more than 50 of the\nexperiments be redesigned to clear up the scientific purpose and\nthe research subject protections.\n\n   NIMH has conducted studies using such drugs as ketamine to\ninduce psychotic symptoms in people with mental illness and healthy\nvolunteers in an effort to better understand the biology of\nschizophrenia. The federal agency has also funded outside\nresearchers for such work. Ketamine, a federally approved animal\ntranquilizer, is also a powerful hallucinogenic drug of abuse known\nas ``Special K.''\n\n   But while better understanding schizophrenia may one day improve\ntreatment of the devastating illness, medical ethicists and others\ncriticize the studies for failing to fully inform people of the\nnature of the research. Critics also raise concerns about the harm\ndone and question whether induced-psychosis studies in people are\nreally the best, or only, way to better understand the disease.\n\n   It was not clear if any of the studies whose enrollment has been\nsuspended, or whose aims and protections have been questioned, are\namong the induced-psychosis experiments.\n\n   But some critics of such studies said they have little\nconfidence that the ongoing NIMH review, or the new review panel to\nbe proposed by Hyman, is enough to protect vulnerable research\nsubjects.\n\n   Vera Hassner Sharav, co-founder of the Citizens for Responsible\nCare in Psychiatry and Research, said, ``The problem with all of\nthis is, this is completely at the discretion of NIMH, so that even\nif they come out with guidelines that greatly restrict or that in\nfact put a moratorium or prohibit the kinds of experiments that we\ndon't think should be conducted on human beings. . ., they could at\nany time loosen those restrictions.''\n\n   Sharav added, ``We need federal regulations that mandate the\nstoppage of these kinds of experiments.''\n\n   Recommendations for stronger federal research regulations to\nprotect people with mental illness were made by the National\nBioethics Advisory Commission two months ago, and the next step is\nfor the White House to act on them.\n","Headline":"\nNATIONAL PANEL REVIEWING PSYCHOSIS STUDIES \n","Text":["\n   The National Institute of Mental Health is reviewing more than\n100 of its studies, including those that involve using drugs to\ninduce psychosis, and could suspend some of them for lack of\nscientific merit.\n","\n   The review of the research program, which began more than a year\nago, comes at a time when heightened concern about studies to\ninduce psychosis and other research involving people with mental\nillness has made headlines across the country.\n","\n   ``This is a process of self-improvement for the program, to\nbring. . .high standards and new vitality to every protocol.
