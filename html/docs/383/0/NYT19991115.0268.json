The idea is that children who have\ntrouble digesting wheat gluten or cow's milk create peptides that\nmimic natural hormones or neurotransmitters. When these rogue\npeptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal\ndevelopment.\n\n   Other theories postulate that autism develops after something\ntriggers an autoimmune response in the brain.\n\n   One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children\nwho had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had\nhigher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly\nto a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the\nprotective sheath around nerve fibers.\n\n   The viral connection has been fueled by anecdotal evidence from\nparents whose children first showed autistic symptoms after being\nimmunized with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is usually\ngiven between 12 and 15 months. So far, however, no scientific\nstudies have been able to link vaccines and autism.\n\n   According to a recent report in the British medical journal\nLancet, for example, the incidence of autism in the United Kingdom\nhas been increasing since 1979. The MMR vaccine was introduced in\n1988, but there was no sharp increase in cases of autism after\nthat.\n\n   In addition, the average age of onset of autism is the same for\nchildren whether they have been vaccinated or not, further\nweakening a proposed link between the vaccine and the disorder.\n\n   But parents are still worried, and researchers acknowledge the\nquestion needs further study.\n\n   Although the debate surrounding viruses continues, there is some\ndefinitive evidence that outside agents can cause autism.\n\n   For example, it is known that babies whose mothers took the\nanti-nausea drug thalidomide at 28 days' gestation have a much\nhigher incidence of autism.\n\n   Autism also has been associated with children born to mothers\nwho were given drugs to control their epilepsy, said Dr. Alan Unis,\nassociate professor of psychiatry at the UW.\n\n   Those examples suggest the development of autism is foreshadowed\nin the earliest stages of embryonic brain development.\n\n   There may be many more unknown agents that could cause such\ndamage.\n\n   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example,\nhave been investigating whether an unusually high incidence of\nautism in Brick Township, N.J., could be related to environmental\ncauses, or is simply a statistical artifact.
