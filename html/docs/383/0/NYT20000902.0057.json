Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The only president whose wild mood swings prompted\nhis own secretary of defense to issue orders designed to block him\nif he called out the Marines for protection against impeachment is\nalso the only president known to have been treated by a\npsychotherapist.\n\n   That president was Richard M. Nixon, and both of those\nexperiences are chronicled in ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret\nWorld of Richard Nixon,'' by Anthony Summers (Viking). And while\nother accounts in his book, including episodes of wife-beating and\npill-popping, are angrily contradicted by Nixon's defenders, the\nrevelations about the secret order and the president's psychiatric\ntreatment have not been widely disputed.\n\n   But they raise important questions. While the physical health of\npresidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public\ndiscussion, the overwhelming majority of politicians still hide\ntheir mental difficulties.\n\n   The evidence is purely anecdotal, but talking to psychiatrists\nin Washington, it is clear that while there have been some changes\nsince Nixon's time (when his therapist, Dr. Arnold A. Hutschnecker,\nvisited the White House rarely and used false destinations when he\nsigned in), they have largely been around the edges.\n\n   Dr. Fred Solomon, a practicing psychiatrist here since the early\n1960s, said, ``I don't think the politicians are any more eager,\nmore relaxed than they used to be about therapy for themselves.''\nBut, he said, they are ``a lot more willing to have family members\nget help.''\n\n   ``The recognition of usefulness for psychiatric care for family\nmembers is just moving along just fine,'' he continued. ``Marital\ncounseling is sought by a number of people, and there is\nrecognition in general that mental health problems can be just as\ndisabling as physical health problems.''\n\n   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has crusaded for legislation\nto force insurance companies to treat mental health the same as\nphysical health, recalled a meeting at Vice President Al Gore's\nhouse a few years ago about a proposed bill. More than 30 senators\nwere there, most with their spouses. They spoke ``very personally\nabout members of their own family or close friends who struggled\nwith mental illness, but not to the point of talking about\nthemselves.''\n\n   Psychiatrists here say they understand why politicians fear\ndisclosure. Dr. Dorothy Starr said, ``I think there remains a good\ndeal of uncertainty in the public mind about people who have been\nmentally ill.'' Another psychiatrist, Dr. Harvey Rich, said, ``We\nhold our politicians up to a different kind of standard _ you can't\nhave a weakness of any kind.''\n\n   Rep. Jim McDermott, who was a Seattle psychiatrist before coming\nto Congress and who has referred other members of Congress to\npsychiatrists, said the fear of being found out discouraged others\nwho talked to him about getting help.\n\n   But the experiences of those politicians who have publicly\nacknowledged mental illness _ in each case treatment for depression\n_ raise questions about that widespread fear. Sen. Thomas Eagleton,\nwho was dropped as a vice-presidential candidate in George\nMcGovern's campaign in 1972 after failing to disclose electroshock\ntreatments for depression, was re-elected to the Senate in Missouri\nin 1974 and 1980. Lawton Chiles, who left the Senate in 1989,\nrecovered from depression and was twice elected governor of\nFlorida. And three current members of the House _ Reps. Lynn Rivers\nof Michigan, Nydia Velazquez of New York and Patrick Kennedy of\nRhode Island _ have survived such disclosures.\n\n   The last time a high-profile campaign tried to damage an\nopponent by accusing him of seeking psychiatric help was in 1988,\nwhen George Bush's presidential campaign and President Ronald\nReagan sought to discredit Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic\nnominee. John Deardourff, a longtime Republican consultant, said he\nbelieved that ``there are enough people in both parties'' today\n``who would speak out against anybody who tried to raise that issue\nagainst a candidate that it would be very dangerous.''\n\n   Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said it could make a\ndifference what office a politician was seeking. For a\ncongressional candidate, he said, the examples of entertainment and\nsports figures suggested disclosure was safe, phrased in terms of\n``Here's a challenge that I faced.''\n\n   But a candidate for president, he said, ``faces a tougher\nbarrier.''\n\n   Deardourff agreed, saying the public understands that the\npresidency is an ``intensely demanding job demanding mental\nstability.''\n\n   Dr. Fred Goodwin, a former head of the National Institute of\nMental Health, said it was important to distinguish between\ndifferent sorts of mental illness _ a treatable depression is one\nthing and schizophrenia another. ``I don't think the public\nconcerns are entirely unfounded,'' Goodwin said. ``When we fight\nstigma, we shouldn't pretend that mental illnesses are just the\nsame as physical illness. If you're talking about a disorder that\naffects thinking, behavior, that's different from high blood\npressure or diabetes.\n\n   ``When the public is uneasy about something, their views may be\nexaggerated, there may be a lot of irrationality, a lot of fear.\nBut when it's pervasive and hangs around, the public is at least\npartially on to something.''\n\n   Solomon pointed out that some politicians, like President\nClinton, publicly engage in spiritual counseling while rejecting\npsychiatric help. And even those who discuss mental illness often\ndo so using murky terminology. ``They also pick their words very\ncarefully, like `counseling,' not `therapy,''' he said. ``They get\nmedication from their internal medicine doctors, like Vince Foster\ndid, but didn't really want to see a psychiatrist.''\n\n   Even Tipper Gore, praised by one psychiatrist after another for\ndiscussing her depression and treatment last year, spoke of\n``counseling.''
