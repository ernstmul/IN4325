Revenues, meanwhile, should rise under a new government\nhealth plan for previously uninsured children with mental health\nproblems. The board of the mental health agency already has\nannounced cuts in central administration and information\nprogramming.\n\n   ``What we know is these new generation medications have a\nprofound impact on people with serious mental illness,'' he said.\n``Their demand for in-patient psychiatric services is definitely\ngoing to decrease.''\n\n   Consequently, Gilbert said, the lower expected cost in the\nsecond year of psychiatric treatment should begin to ``chip away''\nat the budget problem.\n\n   ``He's right, I think. There should be significant savings, but\nwe don't know what that will be,'' said Rep. Garnet Coleman,\nD-Houston, who specializes in mental health issues as a member of\nthe House Appropriations Committee.\n\n   ``We will continue to work with the state auditor's staff and\nstate leadership to address the remaining budget issues and to seek\nadditional long-term solutions,'' said MHMR Commissioner Karen\nHale.\n\n   About $4.4 million of the new funding for drugs and continued\nservice will be transferred from the umbrella Health and Human\nServices Commission, although Gilbert said he didn't know yet from\nwhich programs or agencies the money will be shifted.\n\n   The rest of the money is savings resulting from the agency\nprepaying its leases for next year with money left over in this\nyear's budget, said Laurie Lentz, spokeswoman at the mental health\nagency.\n\n   The reprieve for mental health services brought relief for\nadvocates of the mentally ill.\n\n   ``I'm happy that the department has responded to the community's\nconcerns and the legislators' concerns about the budget cuts and\nthey reinstated those funds for community services, even if it is\nonly for three months,'' said Lynn Lasky, public policy director at\nthe National Association of the Mentally Ill of Texas.\n\n   House Appropriations Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, said it\nis important that the agency reassure those who need mental health\nservices, but said the problems are fundamental.\n\n   ``I am concerned that nobody has a handle on the big picture.
