Times News Service   \n\n   BOSTON _ Russell Weston Jr., the suspect in the fatal shootings\nof two police officers in the nation's Capitol, may have chosen an\nunusually public place to explode. But his history of mental\nillness has much in common with other delusional mentally ill\npeople who become violent, illustrating both the cracks in the\nnation's mental-health system and its difficulty in mandating\ntreatment even for those it knows could become violent.\n\n   Weston's illness was well-known to family and mental health\nofficials. But because of the closing of state mental hospitals\nacross the country and the failure to build a promised network of\nlocal clinics, the treatment of choice for him, as for the vast\nmajority of mental patients, was the honor system: counting on him\nto give himself the often unpleasant antipsychotic drugs prescribed\nfor his paranoid schizophrenia.\n\n   With Weston, the problem was compounded by living in rural areas\nwhere psychiatric treatment and monitoring are extremely limited.\nHe also traveled between two states, Montana and Illinois,\nencouraging at least one to solve his long-term care by sending him\nback to the other.\n\n   When Weston became violent, the reasons behind his behavior were\ntypical of the small group of mentally ill people who become\nviolent, recent research shows. He was not taking his medication,\nhe may have been using other drugs, and he had paranoid delusions _\nin his case that the government was out to get him, using satellite\ndishes aimed at his cabin or assigning Navy Seals and CIA\noperatives to pursue him.\n\n   Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and president of the\nTreatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va. , said ``Mr. Weston is\nan absolutely textbook case of what some of us have been saying for\nyears'' _ the dangers inherent in leaving untreated someone with\nparanoid schizophrenia who does not understand he is ill.\n\n   He estimated that there are about 100,000 people with\nschizophrenia nationwide who are not being treated.\n\n   The problem is preventable, Torrey said, given the development\nof powerful drugs that can stabilize patients with severe mental\nillnesses. In the 1960s states began to close mental hospitals\nbecause the drugs offered a more humane _ and less expensive _ way\nto treat the mentally ill in their communities. That approach,\nhowever, required a network of community clinics to make sure\npatients took the drugs, and those clinics were not built.\n\n   As a result, many people with schizophrenia, manic-depression\nand severe depression stop taking their drugs and regress. Every\nday 200,000 are held in jails or prisons because of the bizarre\nbehavior that results.\n\n   Torrey's advocacy group seeks to improve treatment of the\nseriously mentally ill and to change laws that make it difficult to\ncommit mental patients against their will.\n\n   Such problems exist throughout most of the country. In\nWestchester County, N.Y., in June, Michael Laudor, a Yale Law\nSchool graduate who had won book and movie deals for the story of\nhis successful battle against schizophrenia, was charged with\nstabbing his fiance to death. His medications had become\nineffective, friends said, but he had not been hospitalized.\n\n   The mental-health net is especially weak in rural areas, where\nthe nearest psychiatrist may be 100 miles away and there is often\nan aversion to government spending.\n\n   In Montana, where Weston lived in a cabin over much of the past\n20 years, ``It is so hard to get psychiatric treatment you usually\nhave to get arrested to get treatment,'' said Wesley Alcorn, a\nmember of the state board of the National Alliance for the Mentally\nIll, a group made up of relatives and friends of mentally ill\npeople.\n\n   In fact, under Montana law, for a person to be committed to the\nstate hospital at Warm Springs, he must pose an imminent threat to\nhimself or others, ``which is usually interpreted to mean he must\nbe pointing a gun at himself or someone else,'' Alcorn said. Many\npeople with mental disorders are simply put in the local jail, he\nsaid.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   A judge committed Weston to the Warm Springs hospital for 53\ndays in 1996, apparently after Weston made a threat against\nPresident Clinton and was interviewed by the Secret Service.\n\n   After being placed on medication, he was released on Dec. 2,\n1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no longer a threat to\nhimself or others,'' according to a spokesman for Gov. Marc\nRacicot. A hospital employee drove him to his cabin in nearby\nRimini, the spokesman said, and made arrangements for him to\nreceive further treatment at a mental health center in Waterloo,\nIll., near his parents' rural home outside Valmeyer in southern\nIllinois.\n\n   Alcorn described this as ``Greyhound therapy,'' a way to save\nMontana money by buying Weston a one-way bus ticket for a trip out\nof the state.\n\n   In a series of interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents and\nsister, April Callahan, said that he returned to Illinois with\nthree medications (whose names they did not remember) and that he\nstopped taking them about a week later, despite his family's\nprotests. While his family described their growing concern over his\nparanoid delusions, they also seemed to understand little about how\nto seek help for him, or what treatment was available.\n\n   The only community mental health clinic in Waterloo is Human\nSupport Services, a state-funded center. A spokesman for the\nclinic, Rob Singer, refused to say on Monday whether Weston had\nbeen a client there after his return from Montana.\n\n   Torrey said people like Weston would be less likely to fall\nthrough the cracks if states like Montana and Illionois used\nexisting laws that provide for involuntary outpatient treatment.\nSuch laws allow states to force a patient to take his medication if\nhe fails to show up for appointments at a local clinic or stops\ntaking his medication.\n\n   Preventing a shooting like that attributed to Weston is\nparticularly difficult because the relationship between mental\nillness and violence is very sensitive, and many experts have been\ncautious about publicizing new research suggesting that in certain\nsituations the emotionally disturbed are more violent than other\npeople.\n\n   Such situations occur when mentally ill persons have strong\nparanoid symptoms that someone is out to get them or hear a voice\ntelling them to kill, said Bruce Link, a professor at Columbia\nUniversity School of Public Health. Another is when a patient fails\nto show up for treatment or is off his medication, said Jeffrey\nSawnson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University.\n\n   Last May, a MacArthur Foundation study found that mental\npatients are no more violent than others unless they are abusing\ndrugs or alcohol. And Swanson said it is important to remember that\nthe mentally ill are responsible for only about 4 percent of\noverall violence, making mental illness a smaller risk factor for\nviolence than being young, male or poor. But in a sign of how the\nexperts disagree on the subject, Torrey stressed that mentally ill\npeople commit 1,000 homicides a year.\n","Headline":"\nCAPITOL SHOOTING EXPOSES CRACKS IN MENTAL-HEALTH CARE SYSTEM \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Russell Weston Jr., the suspect in the fatal shootings\nof two police officers in the nation's Capitol, may have chosen an\nunusually public place to explode.
