Here's\nyour cup, there's the bathroom. Give us a urine sample, then we'll\ntalk stock options, pal.\n\n   Want to stay employed in that construction job? Better watch\nwhat you ingest over the weekend because you may be randomly\nselected to give a sample before firing up the bulldozer Monday\nmorning.\n\n   In 1986, only 21.5 percent of companies tested employees,\naccording to a survey by the American Management Association. By\n1996, 81 percent did.\n\n   The number of Fortune 200 companies that require pre-employment\nor random drug testing grew from 6 in 1983 to 196 in 1996, the AMA\nfound.\n\n   Eighty-three percent of employers surveyed believe that testing\nslows employee drug use, according to the AMA study. But 80 percent\nof companies in the same survey had never done a cost-effectiveness\nanalysis.\n\n   Now, for the first time, several studies question the worth of\nworkplace drug testing.\n\n   In September, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report\nbased on studies by the National Science Foundation and the AMA\nshowing that testing has been ineffective in reducing drug use and\nhas no noticeable impact on reducing either absenteeism or\nproductivity.\n\n   The National Academy of Sciences recently found that illegal\ndrugs contribute little to workplace accidents and that off-duty\ndrug use has about the same small effect on worker accidents as\noff-duty drinking.\n\n   And, in January's Working USA magazine, two researchers with the\nLe Moyne College Institute of Industrial Relations surveyed 63\nSilicon Valley companies and found that productivity was 29 percent\nlower in firms with pre-employment and random testing.\n\n   Still, few businesses have abandoned drug testing, even though\nthe AMA found it costs a company $77,000 to find one drug user by\ntesting all employees.\n\n   ``If drug testing didn't work, why would we see so many\ncompanies instituting policies in an era where every department in\na corporation has to prove its worth?'' asked Mark de Bernardo,\nexecutive director of the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace and\nmanaging partner at Littler Mendelson's Washington, D.C., office.\n\n   ``I don't doubt for a second it works. It's ludicrous to think a\nprogram that results in deterrence and detection of substance abuse\ndoesn't work.''\n\n   But Lewis Maltby, director of the ACLU's National Taskforce on\nCivil Liberties in the Workplace, called for employers to rethink\nwhat he calls ``an invasive and humiliating procedure for\nemployees.'' Maltby charges that most large and medium-size\ncorporations know there is little cost benefit or effectiveness in\ntesting employees. They do it, he says, for public relations.\n\n   ``I have a friend who formerly was the CEO of a Fortune 500\ncompany, and I asked him why he spent all that money on a\ndrug-testing program even though he'd told me privately he knew it\nwasn't doing that good for the bottom line,'' Maltby said.\n\n   ``And he said, `I don't care if it improves bottom line. I'm a\npublicly held company. I've got stockholder meetings and every year\nI get asked what we're doing about the drug crisis in America. The\npolicy is my answer.' It's there for image.''\n\n   Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for the AMA, said\ndrug education and awareness programs have proven more effective\nthan testing, according to his group's research.\n\n   ``Ten years of survey data have not allowed us to make a\nstatistical case that drug testing makes a difference,'' Greenberg\nsaid.\n\n   SmithKline cq   Beecham Clinical Laboratories, the nation's\nleading drug-testing corporation, recently reported that positive\ntest results fell from 18.7 percent of pre-employment and random\ntesting in 1987 to 5 percent in 1998.\n\n   But Greenberg argued that test-positive rates went down not\nbecause fewer workers were doing drugs, but because more companies\nmoved from testing only ``for cause'' to more widespread random\ntesting. ``In all of our years of researching, the only hard case\nwe can make in our data is that drug education and awareness\nprograms in companies deter use, whether they test or not,''\nGreenberg said.\n\n   Bay Area corporations are believed to have a lower\npre-employment testing rate than companies in other regions, though\nno statistics exist, because private-sector companies are not\nrequired to make policies public.\n\n   Levi-Strauss, for instance, performs pre-employment drug testing\non employees in manufacturing and logistics, according to a\nspokeswoman.\n\n   The Bay Area's other major apparel company, the Gap, does not\nrequire pre-employment testing, according to a spokeswoman.\n\n   Intel instituted pre-employment drug testing shortly after\nCongress passed the 1988 Drug Free Workplace Act, which requires\nfederal contractors and grant recipients to provide drug-free\nworkplaces. Though Intel does not do federal contract work, it\ninstituted testing to enhance quality control.\n\n   ``It's just the nature of this business,'' Intel spokeswoman\nTracy Koon said. ``It's a matter of safety and productivity. We\nwant to make sure our product is high quality.''\n\n   Koon said that in 1997, Intel had 0.39 percent positives out of\n13,165 tests. In 1998, positives fell to 0.18 percent out of 3,696\ntested. This year, through October 19, Intel had 0.15 percent\npositives out of 6,294 pre-employment tests.\n\n   ``We are convinced that our testing has helped these numbers\nfall and raises our productivity,'' Koon said.\n\n   But many Silicon Valley firms, such as Cisco Systems, do not\ntest.\n\n   Eric Shepard, co-author of the Le Moyne study of drug testing in\nSilicon Valley, said his researchers combined each company's\ndrug-testing data with its public financial information.\n\n   ``We found that productivity was 16 percent lower in companies\nwith pre-employment testing than those that didn't test, and it was\n29 percent (lower) in companies with both pre-employment and random\ntesting,'' he said. ``It's hard to determine exactly why that is,\nbecause it's not easy to get companies to talk about drug testing\nat all.''\n\n   Shepard said his survey didn't delve into the reasons\nproductivity declined, but he has a theory.\n\n   ``If drug tests contribute a negative view toward the company,\nas other surveys have found, then workers may not contribute as\nmuch in return, or they may seek employment elsewhere,'' Shepard\nsaid. ``You may lose your best workers to companies that don't\ntest.''\n\n   Dan Abrahamson, a San Francisco attorney for the Lindesmith\nCenter, a national drug policy institute that opposes drug testing,\nsaid he receives at least one e-mail a week from high-tech workers\nwho smoke marijuana away from the job and are concerned about drug\ntesting at work.\n\n   ``There are a lot of smart, creative people who work in Silicon\nValley in programming and they feel it helps them intellectually to\nuse marijuana,'' Abrahamson said. ``So testing might actually hurt\ntheir work.''\n\n   Ed, a 27-year-old financial analyst at Charles Schwab in San\nFrancisco who declined to give his last name, said he would have\nthought twice about accepting an offer from the company six months\nago if that company required pre-employment drug tests.\n\n   ``I don't use drugs,'' he said, ``but I would look at that\ncompany as not as trusting (and) more rules oriented, as opposed to\na place that values its employees and entrusts them to do a good\njob.''\n\n   San Francisco was the first city in the country to pass\nlegislation limiting drug testing in the workplace. In 1985, the\nBoard of Supervisors passed a statute drafted by civil rights\nlawyer Cliff Palefsky banning random drug testing except for\nworkers in safety-sensitive jobs.\n\n     sh1    Safety-Sensitive Jobs\n\n   Several years later, California also passed a statute allowing\nrandom testing only for employees in safety-sensitive jobs. What\nconstitutes ``safety sensitive'' is open to legal interpretation,\nhowever.\n\n   In 1996, a worker at the Fresno Irrigation District was fired\nfor failing a random drug test. Ron Smith, a ditch digger who had a\nspotless record and won five safety awards in six years on the job,\nwon a suit in Fresno Superior Court saying the test violated his\nconstitutional rights because he wasn't employed in a\n``safety-sensitive job.''\n\n   However, in May, the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Fresno\noverturned the ruling, saying that Smith's job was safety\nsensitive.\n\n   ``Anyone operating a big piece of heavy machinery, sure, that\nmight harm other people, but Smith barely even used a shovel,''\nsaid Joseph A. Davis, Smith's attorney. ``Fresno argued that Mr.\nSmith could possibly fall into the canal and someone else may be\nimperiled going in to save him. Well, if that's the case, we're all\nin safety-sensitive jobs.''\n\n   For those in non-safety-sensitive jobs, some companies will be\nmore lenient in punishing drug-test offenders, notes Greenberg of\nthe American Management Association. Not that they will admit it\npublicly.\n\n   ``I know of companies that test for drugs that are illegal but\nreally don't affect job performance,'' Greenberg said. ``They'll\npick and choose which positive tests to act on. Some companies just\ndon't want to know. Any advertising firm that gave its copywriters\npre-employment tests would have a real hard time filling positions,\nif you know what I mean.''\n\n     \n   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   Want that high-profile new job at a Fortune 200 company?
