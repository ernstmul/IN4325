Times News Service   \n\n   SALT LAKE CITY _ For the second time in three months, this\nconservative city grappled Friday with news that a schizophrenic\nresident who refused to take medication had walked up to strangers\nand shot them dead.\n\n   Police spokesmen and advocates for the mentally ill called for\nbarring gun sales to people with histories of severe mental illness\nand for laws mandating that schizophrenics take their medicine.\n\n   The gunman, Sergei Babarin, 70, killed two people and wounded\nfive others at a genealogical library before dying in a gun battle\nwith the police on Thursday, the authorities said. His widow and\nson said Friday that he had refused to take his medication for\nschizophrenia since December.\n\n   Only three months ago, on Jan. 13, De-Kieu Duy, a woman who also\nhad a history of schizophrenia, entered an office complex three\nblocks away from Thursday's killings at Temple Square, the heart of\nthe Mormon Church, and shot to death an AT&T employee, the police\nsay.\n\n   The killings are only the latest involving schizophrenics who\nrefuse to take their medicine. These cases, the police say, include\na man who pushed a young woman in front of a subway train in New\nYork in January, a man who stabbed to death his pregnant fiancee\nlast June at their home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and a Montana\nman who killed two police officers at the U. S. Capitol last\nsummer.\n\n   The Treatment Advocacy Center, which seeks mandatory medication\nlaws, says Americans with untreated severe mental illnesses commit\nnearly 1,000 homicides a year.\n\n   ``People who are having severe mental illness problems should be\nprevented from buying a weapon,'' Lt. Phil Kirk, a police spokesman\nhere, said, noting that Barbarin and Ms. Duy previously had been\narrested for misdemeanor offenses involving weapons. Referring to a\nfederal law requiring background checks for felonies before guns\nmay be sold, he said, ``The Brady bill should be extended to\nmisdemeanors involving weapons offenses.''\n\n   In 1995, Babarin was arrested here after he punched a\n73-year-old man in a department store restroom, then tried to bite\nhim on the face, the police said. At the time, he was carrying a\nloaded .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. He pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, and the police\ncarried out a court order to destroy his gun. Today, Lieutenant\nKirk said the police were trying to learn how Barbarin got a new\nweapon.\n\n   With surveys indicating that two-thirds of Utah adults own\nfirearms, mental health advocates say more money should be spent on\ninsuring that schizophrenics take their medicine, prescription\ndrugs that often allow them to lead normal lives.\n\n   ``All I am hearing today is how we need to keep guns away from\nthe mentally ill,'' said Vickie Cottrell, executive director of the\nUtah chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a\nnonprofit advocacy group. ``Well, how about getting the medication\nto the mentally ill?''\n\n   In Utah, medication is only mandatory if mentally ill people\npose an immediate danger to themselves or to others. Mrs. Cottrell,\nwhose daughter has brought her schizophrenia under control with\nmedication, said: ``I know of too many families who have tried to\nget their loved one in a hospital. Too many times, terrible things\nhappen.''\n\n   Only last month, the Utah Legislature rejected pleas by mental\nhealth advocates to finance a system that would provide medical\nmonitoring of severely mentally ill people who are released from\nhospitals and prisons.\n\n   Barbarin's son, Alex, said he had asked doctors for help with\nhis father, but was told that state laws limited involuntary\ncommitment to people who posed an imminent danger.\n\n   ``It's an unreasonable liberty with people who need help,'' he\ntold The Deseret News here. ``You must be more preventive, because\none mentally ill person can damage so many lives _ not because he\nintends to, but because he can't help it.''\n\n   Sergei Babarin, a toolmaker who emigrated from Leningrad,\nRussia, to New York in 1981, had displayed odd behavior after\nmoving here a decade ago, the police said.\n\n   Mark Zelig of the Salt Lake Police said Babarin had thought his\nson was a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency and last year\nattacked a bicyclist by sticking an umbrella in his wheel spokes.\nBarbarin was not charged in that incident.\n\n   ``He would say `Heil Hitler and I hate America,' '' a neighbor\nsaid on Thursday at the the apartment complex for the elderly where\nhe lived. ``He could've been helped mentally, but somebody\nfailed.''\n","Headline":"\nCRACKDOWN ON SCHIZOPHRENICS IS URGED AFTER UTAH SHOOTING  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   SALT LAKE CITY _ For the second time in three months, this\nconservative city grappled Friday with news that a schizophrenic\nresident who refused to take medication had walked up to strangers\nand shot them dead.\n","\n   Police spokesmen and advocates for the mentally ill called for\nbarring gun sales to people with histories of severe mental illness\nand for laws mandating that schizophrenics take their medicine.\n","\n   The gunman, Sergei Babarin, 70, killed two people and wounded\nfive others at a genealogical library before dying in a gun battle\nwith the police on Thursday, the authorities said.
