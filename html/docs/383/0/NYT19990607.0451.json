First lady Hillary Rodham\nClinton, considering a run for the Senate, also participated.\n\n   Addressing experts and lawmakers, Clinton spoke both of the\nadvancements in treating mental illness and of the need for\nbusinesses and government to give patients better access to\ntreatment.\n\n   To remedy at least part of the problem, the president said, he\nhas issued a directive requiring the 285 health plans serving\nfederal employees to offer parity between physical and mental\nhealth and substance abuse benefits by 2001.\n\n   That means that those health plans cannot charge higher\nco-payments or impose different coverage limits on mental health\nbenefits.\n\n   Federal officials estimate that such improved benefits would\nincrease premium costs by about 2 percent.\n\n   Clinton said businesses should emulate the federal government on\nmental health parity, because the cost will be greater if the\ndisease is ignored.\n\n   ``Insurance plans claim providing parity for mental health will\nsend costs and premiums skyrocketing. Businesses believe employees\nwill overuse mental health services, making it impossible for\nemployers to offer health insurance,'' Clinton said. ``But I\nbelieve that providing parity is something we can do at a\nreasonable cost, benefit millions of Americans and over the long\nrun, have a healthier country and lower health care costs.''\n\n   Interest in treating mental illness, long a taboo subject, has\nrisen in recent years. In 1996 Congress approved a prohibition on\nhealth plans setting lower annual and lifetime limits for mental\nhealth care than other medical service. And this year lawmakers of\nboth parties are proposing measures that mandate that insurers\nprovide parity in mental and physical benefits.\n\n   Twenty-three states have mental health parity laws, although the\nmeasures vary widely on who and what benefits are covered.\n\n   In Texas, mental health parity is required for state and local\ngovernments, as a result of a 1991 law.\n\n   But many businesses still do not provide mental health parity\nbenefits because of the cost. Even the National Mental Health\nAssociation, which has been lobbying for the change, does not offer\nparity in benefits, although a spokesman said the group is\nnegotiating a new contract that will provide equal treatment.\n\n   The conference was dominated by Clinton's political proteges who\nmay benefit in 2000 by embracing mental health initiatives.\n\n   Tipper and Al Gore and the first lady took turns interviewing\nmental health experts and former patients in a talk-show style\nformat.\n\n   Tipper Gore talked with Mike Wallace of television's ``60\nMinutes'' about his bouts with depression and also referred to her\nown illness following a serious accident involving her son who was\nhit by a car.\n\n   She spoke of the importance of public figures sharing their\nstories ``so that people can see that it is very wrong to\ndiscriminate against people who have a mental health issue.''\n\n   Her husband, who is expected to run for the White House in 2000,\nalso interviewed a woman, Robin Kitchell of Franklin Tenn., whose\nson had bipolar disorder and the vice president of the Bank One\nCorp., which offers parity in mental health benefits.\n\n   Hillary Clinton, who is expected to stress her interest in\nhealth care in a likely New York Senate bid, spoke to several\nmedical experts, including Harold Koplewicz, the director of the\nNew York University Child Study Center, who talked about ways of\ntreating mental illness.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nCLINTON ANNOUNCES MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES \n\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday announced improved\nmental health benefits for federal workers at a conference led by\nthe vice president's wife, who has acknowledged her struggle with\ndepression.\n","\n   The mental health conference at Howard University gave the\npresident a chance to announce new initiatives but also provided a\nforum for Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, who are\ngearing up for a presidential campaign.
