Where he's headed, I just don't\nknow,'' said Urban, adding that while his son was finally\nhospitalized and released, he still has not gotten the treatment he\nneeds. ``Now he's angry, he's disturbed, agitated and confused,\nbecause the system has jerked him around so much.''\n\n   At a news conference at 1 p.m. at the Statehouse Wednesday,\nUrban and other critics of mental health services will challenge\nthe state's $200-million-a-year contract with the Massachusetts\nBehavioral Health Partnership to provide services to 400,000\nmentally ill adults and children.\n\n   The privatization of mental health services once provided by the\nstate is leading to denial of needed care, inappropriately short\nhospital stays and overreliance on medication, the critics charged,\nwhile the for-profit company makes its profits.\n\n   At the same time, the state and the Partnership have been slow\nto respond to requests for information vital to monitoring care,\nthe critics said.\n\n   ``The fact that (monitoring information) hasn't been produced\nsets off real alarm bells for me,'' said Susan Fendell, senior\nattorney for the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, who has\nlong been requesting information from the state Division of Medical\nAssistance (DMA), which administers the contract with the\nPartnership   .    Only last week Fendell got year-old information that\nstill needs to be analyzed.\n\n   ``Either DMA is not doing its job properly in monitoring the\nprogram, or they're withholding the information that the public\nshould have,'' said Fendell, who will be among those at the news\nconference. The legal advisors committee, an arm of the Supreme\nJudicial Court, is also part of the DMA's behavioral health program\nadvisory council.\n\n   In addition to Fendell and Urban, others planning to speak at\nthe news conference include Barbara Rhuda of the Alliance for the\nMentally Ill, clinical psychologist Paul K. Ling, psychiatric nurse\nPatricia Hayward and former state senator and current Democratic\ngubernatorial candidate Patricia McGovern.\n\n   But state and Partnership officials say that they have responded\nin a timely fashion to requests for information, and that the\nquality of care has been maintained.\n\n   ``I've heard of no complaints,'' said John Widdison, spokesman\nfor the Department of Mental Health, which used to provide the\nservices that the Partnership now does.\n\n   While Widdison said he could not comment directly on the\nPartnership contract, since DMA, also known as Medicaid,\nadministers it, he added, ``We hold Medicaid accountable and\nMedicaid holds the Partnership accountable.''\n\n   Richard Sheola, chief executive officer for the Partnership,\nsaid DMA has been so satisfied with the services that it has agreed\nto extend the Partnership's three-year contract an additional year,\nthrough 2000. In addition, DMA has just awarded the Partnership a\ntwo-year, $3.4 million contract to administer another state\nprogram, the primary care clinician network management service for\nMedicaid patients, Sheola said.\n\n   ``It does suggest a high level of confidence that the (DMA)\ncommissioner has in us,'' Sheola said. In addition, he pointed to\nseveral other organizations that have supported the Partnership's\nwork, including Mental Health Corporations of Massachusetts Inc.,\nwhich represents providers, such as community mental health\nagencies.\n\n   While critics such as Mel Urban have charged the Partnership\nwith denying patients necessary care to make money, Sheola said the\ncontract is structured in such a way as to discourage that from\nhappening.\n\n   Sheola said patient confidentiality prevented him from\ncommenting on the Urban case, but he added that under Partnership\npolicy, rarely, if ever, are patients denied hospital admission.\n\n   ``Our general policy is our members get access to the highest\nquality care as quickly as possible,'' Sheola said. ``We have an\nobligation and a commitment to provide access to the least\nrestrictive, most clinically appropriate care that's available.''\n","Headline":"\nFOR-PROFIT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS ITS CRITICS\n","Text":["\n   Twice since February, Mel Urban's 30-year-old son has been\ndenied hospital admission for treatment of psychosis, and he puts\nthe blame on the state's for-profit mental health managed care\ncontractor.\n","\n   ``It's the worst I've ever seen him,'' said Urban of his son,\nwho was diagnosed 11 years ago with bipolar disorder, a mental\nillness characterized by periods of mania and of depression.\n","\n   ``He just feels very depressed.
