Times News Service   \n\n   A state advisory panel has proposed new rules that would allow\nmedical experiments involving some risk to be performed on mentally\nill patients and others incapable of giving consent.\n\n   The proposed rules have caused concern among some advocates for\nthe disabled, who said they did not go far enough in protecting the\nrights of such patients, including those suffering from Alzheimer's\ndisease and schizophrenia in state-sponsored psychiatric\nfacilities.\n\n   The proposals, which were reported in The New York Post on\nSunday, are contained in a report compiled by an advisory panel on\nhuman subject research that was convened by the State Health\nDepartment.\n\n   Ruth Lowenkron, a lawyer with the advocacy group Lawyers for the\nPublic Interest, said the plan had loopholes that could lead to\nriskier experiments than should be allowed on patients incapable of\nconsenting.\n\n   In 1996, Ms. Lowenkron's group and other advocates won a lawsuit\non behalf of mentally ill patients over the existing state rules on\nsuch experiments. In a decision that forced the cancellation of at\nleast 10 research projects, a New York state appeals court found\nthat the rules did not adequately protect people who, because of\nage or illness, could not give informed consent to take part. The\ndecision focused particularly on experiments that might pose a\nhealth risk without providing any direct benefit to the patient.\n\n   Researchers defended those rules, saying that the only way to\ntest drugs intended for treatment of severe mental illness or\nAlzheimer's disease was on patients with those disorders, many of\nwhom lack the capacity to consent.\n\n   Under the rules that were struck down, researchers could use\nmental patients in such experiments with the approval of\n``surrogates'' like friends or family members.\n\n   Under new rules proposed by the advisory group, the state Health\nDepartment would establish three levels of risk for human\nexperiments: minimal risk, minor increase over minimal risk and\nmore than minor increase over minimal risk. The ethics board of\neach institution would determine which category an experiment fell\ninto.\n\n   Ms. Lowenkron said she was not so much concerned about the\nminimal risk category because the dangers to the patient were so\nlow. She said there were strong protections in the greatest risk\ncategory because patients could only be enrolled if they had agreed\nto take part in the experiment before falling ill or had designated\nsomeone as their proxy.\n\n   But Ms. Lowenkron said the middle category could make it too\neasy to experiment on mentally ill and disabled patients because\nthey could be placed in the experiment by a court, guardian, family\nmember or close friend.\n\n   ``This is a loophole which they could drive a truck through,''\nshe said. ``I'm not imputing ill motive, but I'm concerned that\nthis is now going to be just a convenient way to relabel that which\nwas considered very risky to the middle category.''\n\n   But Dr. Herbert Pardes, the chairman of the advisory group and\nthe dean of the faculty of medicine at Columbia University's\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons, defended the report, saying the\n13 advisory panel members strived hard for balance. ``We're\ninterested in safeguarding people's rights but also making sure\nthat good, important research was not blocked,'' he said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
