(fb) \nBy EVELYN NIEVES   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The young street people were leaning against\na store window, watching the police watching them from a second-\nfloor window across the avenue.\n\n   ``They'll arrest us for anything now,'' Justin Montgomery, 22,\nsaid as he dragged on a cigarette. ``They're just waiting for any\nexcuse at all.''\n\n   ``They say we scare people,'' said Orin Wells, 21, who was\nsitting on the sidewalk clutching a chubby nine-week-old\nmixed-breed German shepherd. ``Are we scary?''\n\n   Whether they are scared or just plain fed up, plenty of people\nin the nation's most famously liberal city want the youths,\npanhandlers, drug addicts, drinkers, mentally ill homeless swept\noff Telegraph Avenue, the shopping district here mentioned in every\ntourist guide.\n\n   Last week, the all-Democratic City Council, which is dominated\nby a progressive faction, unanimously passed an emergency measure\nauthorizing police overtime to fight the drug dealing and disperse\nthe entrenched camps of the homeless. The police have been all over\nTelegraph Avenue, in squad cars, on bicycles and in front of\nbusinesses.\n\n   ``They've started turning things around,'' said Andy Ross, owner\nof Cody's Books, a hangout that has stood at the most popular\ngathering spot for the homeless, the corner of Telegraph Avenue and\nHaste Street, for 21 years. ``A few days ago,'' Ross said, ``There\nwere 50 people camped out in front of Cody's dealing drugs and\nmenacing my customers.''\n\n   Store owners started complaining about the youths at least a\nyear ago. In particular, they have complained about the young\npeople who come from all over the country to linger on Telegraph\nand Haste. The situation is much like that one in San Francisco's\nHaight-Ashbury district, which is also showing signs of battle\nfatigue.\n\n   Homeless people have congregated here for 30 years, but many\nlocals say the more recent newcomers have more than tested the\nlimits of tolerance with their drinking, drug dealing, defecating,\nurinating and aggressive panhandling. Not to mention their sheer\nnumbers: 20 to 30 congregate at any one time in one corner, most of\nthem with dogs.\n\n   Last week, when one store, Half Price Books, announced it was\nmoving out because of the youths, and five others threatened to do\nthe same, Mayor Shirley Dean, declared that the situation had gone\nfrom ``severe to critical.''\n\n   ``This used to be a vibrant place,'' Dean said. ``It's not\nanymore. It's become a menacing place, where hard, hard drugs are\ndealt, there have been people having sex on the sidewalks, S&M sex\non the sidewalk, anti-Semitic graffiti.''\n\n   Over the last two weeks, before the crackdown, two windows at\nCody's Books were smashed, one apparently by a vandal, the other by\na young man who was shoved into it in a fight, Ross said. In recent\nmonths, business has dropped by 15 percent in the day, he said, 75\npercent at night. At night, many of the youths had taken to\nsleeping along the wall, cocooned in blankets, bodies scattered\nlike bowling pins. In the daytime, they would use the wall as a\nback rest as they smoked pot and sold drugs.\n\n   Now, the people who are still hanging around gather in small,\nwary clutches.\n\n   Homeless advocates question the timing of the crackdown, just\nbefore the mayor and half the City Council members are up for\nre-election. ``We really believe this is an election-motivated\nissue,'' said Sally Hindman, executive director of the Chaplaincy\nfor the Homeless, which runs a drop-in center for homeless runaway\nyouth a block from Telegraph Avenue. ``There is something appealing\nto people about hearing tough-on-crime talk.''\n\n   Hindman said the city would be wiser to address the problems of\nhomelessness, rather than criminalize the behavior of the people on\nthe street.\n\n   ``On any night, there are 1,000 to 1,200 people sleeping on the\nstreets of Berkeley,'' she said. ``Half of them are\ndeinstitutionalized mentally ill people. It's like a mental ward on\nthe streets. Some of them are on drugs. But we have no detox center\nin Berkeley.''\n\n   Hindman said the youths, most of them between 18 and 25, tend to\ncome from severely troubled families, and that 21 out of 27 youths\nthe center has counseled have diagnosable mental illnesses,\nincluding post-traumatic stress. ``You talk to them once, they'll\nsay they're traveling,'' she said. ``You start talking to them\nmore, they'll tell you they left because their parents were beating\nthem.''\n\n   The mayor said she is proposing a plan that involves both\nincreased social services for the homeless youths and ``tough\nlove.'' That includes pushing them off the streets with an\nanti-encampment ordinance. ``I don't think they'll seek services if\nthey don't get a nudge,'' she said.\n\n   Some of the young people have come up with their own plan, which\nthey presented to the City Council last week. They promise that\nthey will stop urinating and sleeping on Telegraph Avenue,\npanhandle in smaller groups, keep their dogs on leashes and pick up\ntheir trash. In return, they have asked the city to provide more\ntrash cans, create a dog run, clean the public bathrooms more often\nand open Berkeley's first shelter for young people.\n\n   The mayor called the plan ``interesting.''\n\n   But on Telegraph and Haste, there were grumblings that the city\nwould never take the plan seriously.\n\n   ``They're making us out to be devils,'' Orin Wells said. He said\nhe comes here from British Columbia when the weather gets cold\nthere. ``People are getting arrested for selling $10 worth of\npot,'' Wells said. ``They're not even the drug dealers. They get\n$20 worth of pot from the real drug dealers and sell it for a $5\ncut, just to eat.''\n\n   Nearby, a group of homeless people were quietly nodding. Wells\nshook his head in disgust. ``This is Telegraph and Haste,'' he\nsaid. ``My parents used to hang out here when they were young.
