The fact is, Wilson is finding out where\nthe love has gone when he looks out at the adoring audiences\ngathered to hear him sing the classic songs from his cherished 1966\nBeach Boys masterpiece, ``Pet Sounds,'' backed by an orchestra and\nhis longtime touring unit, the Wondermints.\n\n   The Pet Sounds Symphonic Tour comes to the Hollywood Bowl on\nSunday and moves to Humphrey's in San Diego on Tuesday.\n\n   ``We're picking up orchestras in every city,'' Wilson explained.\n``I thought it was time to try an experiment. It was suggested to\nme by my wife and manager, who said it might be a good idea to do\n'Pet Sounds' with strings. I said, 'No, no, no.' They said, 'You\nknow damn well it'll go over great.'''\n\n   The early signs were promising. A few months ago, Wilson and the\n10-piece Wondermints did two sold-out nights at the Sunset Strip's\nintimate Roxy, where they recorded a 26-track live album that\nincluded note-for-note reproductions of such ``Pet Sounds'' gems as\n``Caroline, No,'' ``Sloop John B.'' and ``God Only Knows''\n(available at www.brianwilson.com).\n\n   Once again, the recording was the idea of Wilson's wife,\nMelinda, whom he married in 1995. Laughing and joking with the\ncrowd, Wilson was a strong and rejuvenated presence on those\nnights, easily navigating the legendary intricacies of his\n34-year-old arrangements, which include complex voicings,\nmeticulous harmonies and subtle melodic shifts.\n\n   As Wilson put it: ``It wasn't as easy as it sounds. I had to\nkeep drilling them until they got it right. Eventually, it all came\ntogether.''\n\n   It's often said the highly influential ``Pet Sounds'' is more a\nWilson solo project than a Beach Boys album. Session musicians,\nincluding bassist Carol Kaye and drummer Hal Blaine, played most of\nthe parts even while the spiritual quality of the material is\nenhanced by the gorgeous upper-register vocals of Brian and younger\nbrother Carl Wilson.\n\n   When Brian wasn't singing during the 1965-66 ``Pet Sounds''\nsessions at such legendary Hollywood studios as Western, Sunset\nSound and Gold Star, he was conducting a 23-piece orchestra,\ncreating lush, dense arrangements that were cut live, giving the\nalbum its unusual intimacy.\n\n   To musicians such as Paul McCartney, ``Pet Sounds'' is an\nemotional touchstone, the first real concept album.\n\n   ``He wrote out all the bass lines,'' recalled Kaye, who played\nbass on all but three tracks on the album. ``You could tell he\nwasn't educated in music but had a great natural talent. We had no\nsense it would be a classic. I knew at the time it was great music\nfor the kind of pop it was. It was probably the greatest pop music\nwe were recording at that time, and we were cutting records with\nlots of people.\n\n   ``Brian had some very unusual ideas _ they were symphonic ideas\nfor bass lines. I would come up with my own bass lines for other\nrecords, but with Brian, it was different. He heard bass in a very\ndifferent way.''\n\n   During the making of ``Pet Sounds'' _ which was a relatively low\nseller in the United States compared to previous Beach Boys albums\nbut went to No. 2 in Britain _ Wilson, then 24, combined\nconventional keyboards and guitars with the exotic sounds of\nstrings, bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, the Theremin,\nCoke cans, barking dogs and more.\n\n   ``I was just a kid then,'' Wilson, 58, said recently. ``How\ncould I know what it would become? I didn't know what I was getting\ninto. But it's good for people to hear that album. A lot of love\nwent into making it. It was disappointing when it didn't sell, but\nI realized it was pretty arty for the public at the time.''\n\n   It was during the 1967 recording of the follow-up to ``Pet\nSounds,'' the aborted ``Smile'' project _ which was supposed to\ntake the innovations of ``Pet Sounds'' to new heights and top that\nalbum, the Beatles' ``Revolver'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts\nClub Band'' combined _ that Wilson began showing signs of the\nstrain and psychological damage that would derail his career for\nthe next several decades.\n\n   ``I went through times that were so scary that I wasn't sure I'd\nmake it through,'' he says today.\n\n   Whether due to pressure to top himself and compete with the\nBeatles (whose ``Rubber Soul'' sparked Wilson to create ``Pet\nSounds''), internal disagreements within the Beach Boys, mental\nillness or drug abuse, Wilson ceded leadership of the Beach Boys\nand came off the road for good, retiring to his Hollywood home.\n\n   As the Barenaked Ladies refer to it in their ``Brian Wilson''\nsong, Wilson at one point placed a sand box beneath the piano in\nhis living room for inspiration. Eventually, the sand box was\ndragged back outside _ the cats were using it as a litter box.\n\n   But Wilson couldn't be dragged outside, or anywhere else for\nthat matter, although in the years that followed he remained a key\ncontributor to the Beach Boys' albums, writing some of their most\naffecting work, including hit singles like ``Do It Again'' and\n``Sail on Sailor'' and the album cuts ``Til I Die'' and ``Add Some\nMusic to Your Day.''\n\n   It wasn't until 1988 that Wilson's first solo album was issued,\nbut the self-titled disc was mired in controversy over live-in\ntherapist Eugene Landy's unorthodox techniques in caring for\nWilson. Many felt the album was artistically compromised and Wilson\nwas not calling his own shots.\n\n   With his marriage to Melinda and the addition of daughters Daria\nand Delanie, however, Wilson began to make dramatic, positive\nchanges in his life.\n\n   He contributed to an album project with an old friend,\ncomposer-arranger-producer Van Dyke Parks, who was initially\nenlisted by Wilson to write lyrics for the never-released ``Smile''\n(considered one of the legendary lost albums of the '60s). He\nparticipated in the documentary film and soundtrack ``I Just Wasn't\nMade for These Times'' and helped with ``The Wilsons,'' an album on\nwhich Brian joined daughters Carnie and Wendy for a few tracks and\nreunited with ``Pet Sounds'' lyricist Tony Asher on one cut.\n\n   It was the kind of activity that gave fans hope that Wilson\nwould again attempt a genuine solo album on which every note was\nthe way he wanted it.\n\n   In 1998 after years of sporadic activity, Wilson recorded\n``Imagination,'' which included songs co-written with the likes of\nCarole Bayer Sager, J.D. Souther and Jimmy Buffett.\n\n   Against all odds, Wilson, the last of the Wilson brothers who\nfounded the Beach Boys in Hawthorne in 1961 (Dennis drowned in 1985\nand Carl succumbed to cancer in 1998) had returned.\n\n   Suddenly, it seemed Wilson could handle a concert tour. The\nWilson- obsessive Wondermints were brought in and shows took place\nin several cities, including Los Angeles at the Wiltern Theatre.\n\n   ``We didn't want to reinterpret the tracks,'' remembered\nChicago-based saxophonist-flutist Paul Mertens, who plays with the\nWondermints on the Wilson ``Pet Sounds'' tour. ``We set out to\nre-create the spirit and sound of the original recordings as much\nas possible.''\n\n   A few months later came the Roxy shows, and talks began about a\n``Pet Sounds'' symphonic trek.\n\n   ``There was a lot of excitement about it immediately,'' observed\nGary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry weekly Pollstar.\n``It wasn't that huge a tour, and most of the venues outside of the\nHollywood Bowl have been intimate, but Brian didn't set out to do\nan amphitheater tour. I think he accomplished what he wanted to do\n_ and that's connect with his fans using some of his greatest, most\nbeautiful music.''\n\n   Parks, the ``Smile'' collaborator and lyricist of the Beach Boys\nhit ``Heroes & Villains,'' who will conduct the Hollywood Bowl\nOrchestra tonight in a 20-minute suite of some of Wilson's major\nmusical themes outside of ``Pet Sounds,'' agrees.\n\n   ``That album, those songs ... it was the first sophisticated\napproach to pop music,'' he said. ``It was like a Chinese box: The\nmore you hear, the more it opens up. This piece I'm conducting _ it\nwas my tribute to a man and a music I love.''\n\n   As for the Beverly Hills-based Wilson, he's no longer wondering\nwhere all the love has gone. He sees it in front of him each night\nhe performs.\n\n   ``When the people scream 'I love you,' it pumps me up,'' he\nreflects. ``It's good for my ego and good for my heart.''\n\n   And anything that's good for Brian Wilson's heart and ego is\nultimately good for everyone.   \n------THE PET SOUNDS SYMPHONIC TOUR   \nWhere: Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N.
