The policy would be a humane attempt to end the\n``revolving door'' of substance abuse, they said. The\nadministration has reviewed the homeless policies in Boston,\nChicago, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, Ore., and Santa Monica,\nCalif., some of which have strict law against vagrancy.\n\n   The new plan would target those arrested for public drunkenness\nthree times within a 60-day period. Upon conviction, they would be\noffered a slot in a substance abuse program or a 60-day jail\nsentence.\n\n   The policy, however, would rely on space being available at\ndetoxification centers. If there were no space, the city would\nrevert to the current policy of citing and releasing.\n\n   ``The city recognizes that there's a problem with people being\nseverely intoxicated day in and day out on city streets,'' said\nBevan Dufty, the mayor's director of neighborhood services. ``This\nis about chronic offenders, people who are belligerent and cause a\nthreat to themselves and to others. This is not about\nincarceration, but about helping people.''\n\n   The policy, he said, also would help residents and merchants\naffected by the scofflaws.\n\n   ``The idea is clearly we have a problem with a revolving door of\npeople who are cited continuously and released,'' said Kandace\nBender, the mayor's spokeswoman.\n\n   Those who provide services for the homeless referred to a\nrevolving door of a different kind. This one, they said, would spin\nthe homeless through the criminal justice system and forced\ntreatment, but send them back on the streets to begin the cycle\nover again.\n\n   ``Police officers will force certain individuals of their\nchoosing into treatment inside jails, but the city is not going to\nexpand treatment _ current beds that already have long waiting\nlists will be used,'' said Marykate Connor of Caduceus Outreach\nServices, which provides treatment for mental illness and\naddiction.\n\n   Brown, whose administration has wrestled with homelessness for\nthree years, is searching for a new policy with an eye toward his\nNovember 1999 re-election campaign.\n\n   The administration's plan, called San Francisco Cares, is in\ndraft form. It proposes ``a range of solutions, both short-term and\nlong-term,'' said Terry Hill, the mayor's homeless services\ncoordinator. ``The mayor is not interested in more and more\nshelter. He wants to find concrete long-term solutions for folks\nwho are in dire straits.''\n\n   Hill denied there would be any sweep of homeless people by the\npolice.\n\n   ``Anything punitive or police-led was rejected by the mayor. The\nmayor wants us to treat people where they are whether it's mental\nillness or substance abuse,'' he said.\n\n   One member of the city's Board of Supervisors, Amos Brown, said\nthe city must crack down on public drunkenness, urinating and\ndefecating in public, and using and selling drugs. He said some\npeople use homelessness as an excuse to break the law.\n\n   ``There is no excuse for bad behavior,'' he said. ``Just because\nyou're homeless doesn't mean you have the right to go out there and\nbe unkind to someone.''\n","Headline":"\nSAN FRANCISCO PLANS NEW APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ Homeless people who are arrested repeatedly for\npublic drunkenness would have to choose between a detoxification\nprogram or jail under a new push to find a solution to San\nFrancisco's chronic vagrancy problem.\n","\n   Advocates for the homeless quickly criticized the proposed\ninitiative, saying that the administration of Mayor Willie Brown is\ntrying to make homelessness a crime.\n","\n   Members of the mayor's staff, however, said they were looking to\nsee how other cities deal with the seemingly intractable homeless\nproblem.
