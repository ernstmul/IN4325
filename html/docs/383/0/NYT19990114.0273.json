H. _ Highlighting a signature issue, Tipper Gore,\nthe wife of Vice President Al Gore, introduced several White House\ninitiatives Thursday that were aimed at preventing and treating\nmental illnesses and erasing the stigma for millions of Americans\nwho suffer from them.\n\n   Gore, who serves as mental health policy adviser to President\nClinton, announced that the first White House conference on mental\nhealth would be held this spring. She said it would bring together\nhealth care providers, consumers, and government officials to look\nfor ways to improve conditions for people with mental illnesses,\nfrom new treatments to community strategies for housing and\nemployment.\n\n   Addressing psychiatry students at Dartmouth College's\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Mrs. Gore said, ``Despite the\nmany advances we have made in treating mental illness _ with new\ndrugs, less institutionalization, and better community health\nservices _ mental illness continues to be treated differently from\nphysical illness. This in turn leads to more misunderstand ing,\ngreater stigma and discrimination, increased reluctance to seek\nhelp, and greater disparity in insurance coverage.\n\n   ``It's a vicious cycle really, but we can do something about\nit,'' Mrs. Gore said.\n\n   In addition to the White House conference, Mrs. Gore said the\nClinton administration will propose a $70 million increase in the\nfederal budget for mental health services delivered by the states.\nThe total block grant, which helps communities serve hard-to-reach\nadults and children with mental illnesses, would total $358 million\nin fiscal 2000, a 24 percent increase over 1999.\n\n   Mrs. Gore, who began a day in Manchester, Nashua, Hanover, and\nConcord, also said the president has asked government personnel\nmanagers to examine ways to encourage federal hiring of people with\nmental illnesses. Under current rules, people with mental\nretardation or physical disabilities are provided more special job\nopportunities than those with psychiatric illnesses.\n\n   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, a private advocacy group, hailed the initiatives as\nbreakthroughs and called them a ``terrific way for the federal\ngovernment to bring federal attention to mental health services,\nwhich have been terribly neglected.''\n\n   Faenza said Mrs. Gore was a ``sparkplug'' for the issue of\nmental health, noting that she was instrumental in the\nadminstration pushing for a 1996 law that requires insurance\ncompanies and employers to offer health care coverage for mental\nillnesses that is comparable with physical illnesses.\n\n   Advocates say they believe the political focus on mental\nillnesses has been sharpened in the last year by highly publicized,\nviolent crimes, such as school shootings and the murders of two\npolicemen on Capitol Hill, which were allegedly committed by\nindividuals with psychiatric problems.\n\n   Earlier in the day _ the coldest this year in the state _ Mrs.\nGore announced the Department of Energy will provide 640 low-income\nfamilies in New Hampshire with home-weatherization assistance this\nwinter. According to Mrs. Gore, who was joined at the Manchester\nAirport event by Governor Jeanne Shaheen, energy costs can consume\nas much as 14 percent of the budget of low-income families.\n","Headline":"\nTIPPER GORE FIELDS INITIATIVES TO HELP MENTALLY ILL \n","Text":["\n   HANOVER, N.
