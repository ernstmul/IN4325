Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 10:\n\n   President Clinton has announced that he will require federal\nemployee health plans that cover nine million people to provide the\nsame coverage for mental illness and substance abuse that they do\nfor other diseases. Congress should expand upon that sensible and\nhumane step by requiring mental health parity in all group\ninsurance plans.\n\n   The 1996 Mental Health Parity Act was supposed to do that in\nplans serving businesses with more than 50 employees. But insurance\ncompanies, which opposed the law, have gotten around it by changing\nthe way they limit access to mental health services. The 1996 act\ndoes not mandate mental health coverage. Instead it prohibits\nhealth plans that offer such coverage from setting annual or\nlifetime dollar limits for mental health services that are lower\nthan limits for other medical services. Many insurers have simply\nreplaced those overall limits with tight restrictions on the number\nof hospital days or outpatient visits for mental illness.\n\n   A bill introduced by Sens. Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone,\nsponsors of the 1996 act, would close that huge loophole, and\nimpose the requirement on plans for companies with more than 25\nworkers. The bill would also provide for parity on deductibles and\nco-payments in treatment for severe mental illnesses such as\nschizophrenia. A broader House bill sponsored by Marge Roukema\nwould also include parity for substance abuse treatments.\n\n   Much of the debate in 1996 concerned fears that treating mental\nillnesses equitably would send insurance costs soaring or cause\nmany employers to drop mental health coverage altogether. Evidence\ngathered by the National Institute of Mental Health found that\nneither has happened. A 1998 NIMH study, based largely on states\nthat instituted strong mental health parity requirements before the\n1996 act, found that such requirements increased health care costs\nby less than 1 percent when carried out under managed care. There\nis evidence that the costs connected to parity for substance abuse\ntreatments are also very small.\n\n   Recent medical breakthroughs have produced effective treatments\nfor mental illness. The brain is an organ, and diseases related to\nthis organ should be treated like any other medical illness.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: EQUITABLE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS \n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 10:\n","\n   President Clinton has announced that he will require federal\nemployee health plans that cover nine million people to provide the\nsame coverage for mental illness and substance abuse that they do\nfor other diseases.
