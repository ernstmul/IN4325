Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ Six months after saying he wanted to abolish the\ncity's methadone treatment programs, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has\nabandoned his plan to move all 2,100 heroin addicts at city\nhospitals into abstinence programs, conceding Friday that his idea\nwas ``maybe somewhat unrealistic.''\n\n   The shift came after a five-month city experiment aimed at\nmoving heroin addicts into abstinence programs at the five public\nhospitals resulted in few successes, city officials said Friday.\n\n   Only 21 of the 2,100 addicts have given up methadone, the\nsynthetic drug widely prescribed to blunt the craving for heroin.\nOf those, five have relapsed into heroin use, the officials said.\n\n   Giuliani emphasized that he would continue to vigorously promote\ndrug-free programs in the city, adding that he still believes local\nclinics rely too heavily on methadone. But he said his\nconsultations with drug treatment experts had persuaded him not to\neliminate methadone programs, which researchers across the country\nhave described as the best hope for the vast majority of recovering\nheroin addicts.\n\n   ``What I had proposed was doing away with it completely except\nfor a very short transitional period,'' said Giuliani in an\ninterview Friday. ``That turned out to be too frightening, too\njarring and maybe somewhat unrealistic.''\n\n   Those remarks were quickly applauded by state officials and drug\nexperts who had been stunned by the mayor's plan and by his attacks\non researchers who embraced methadone programs.

Barry McCaffrey, the White House's\ndrug policy chief, ``a disaster.''\n\n   But all the while, Giuliani and his officials were also\nmoderating their policy, acknowledging at press conferences and\nCity Council hearings that abstinence might not work for everyone.\nAnd Thursday, Giuliani returned to that theme yet again in his\nState of the City speech, pulling back from his original proposal\nanother degree.\n\n   ``When I say that I want people off methadone and toward drug\nfreedom, I realize that there's going to be a certain percentage\nwhere that can't be done but we've got to reverse the horrible\nsituation we're in right now,'' Giuliani said in his speech. ``So\nhow about making a deal?'' he continued. ``Instead of doing away\nwith methadone completely _ maybe this will calm everybody down _\nsuppose we reverse the percentages.\n\n   ``Suppose instead of 63 percent of the slots being for keeping\npeople chemically dependent, 63 percent of the slots were for\nprograms that were for drug freedom,'' he said. ``And we'll reserve\n10, 15, 20, whatever we have to for methadone for those people who\nneed to have a transition and for those people where drug-free\nprograms just can't work.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
