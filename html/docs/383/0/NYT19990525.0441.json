Times News Service  \n\n   NEW YORK _ Robert Payton's mother had a premonition that she\nwould never see her son again when she dropped him off at the ferry\nin Weehawken, N.J., that muggy day last summer. ``She turned around\nto wave goodbye to him from the car,'' recalled Payton's sister,\nMaureen Hussey, ``and she didn't see him. She told me later that it\nseemed like an omen to her.''\n\n   Payton was 42, a tall, athletic Manhattan lawyer with dark brown\neyes and a fast, bright smile. He had been his family's quick\nstudy: magna cum laude from Boston University, a law degree and\nwhat looked like a promising legal career ahead. But it never took\noff, and his family discovered one reason why on a horrible day in\nJanuary 1998, with a call from a hospital. He had accidentally\noverdosed on a mix of alcohol, cocaine and other drugs _ his\nprivate demons, apparently, for years _ and he lay unconscious for\nnearly two weeks.\n\n   When Payton finally woke up, he knew he was lucky to be alive,\nand he wanted to start fighting his addictions. But first, it\nturned out, he had to fight something else: his managed-care\ncompany, Aetna U.S. Health Care, which would not approve his\nrequests for in-patient drug rehabilitation.\n\n   Eight months later, after dozens of letters and hundreds of\nphone calls, he won _ a grievance committee for Aetna recommended\nin a Sept. 8 letter that the coverage be approved. But Payton was\nnot there to get the letter. He had died three weeks earlier, of\nanother accidental overdose.\n\n   Payton's story may be extreme. But his case occupies a new and\nactive battlegrounds in the national debate over managed care and\npatients' right to treatment. To many medical professionals across\nthe country, particularly in mental health, as well as several\nstate attorneys general, Payton's case illustrates a growing\nproblem: managed-care companies hindering access to mental health\nand substance abuse services covered in patients' plans.\n\n   The allegations _ of administrative tangles, stonewalling and\nlack of information _ are akin to those levied by patients and\ndoctors who deal with managed-care companies on issues of physical\nillness. But critics of the managed-care companies say those\nproblems are magnified when mental illness and substance abuse are\ninvolved because health maintenance organizations consider those\nconditions to be a lower priority and more vulnerable to costly,\npossibly unnecessary, treatments.\n\n   State attorneys general _ who solicited testimony on the issue\nlast month at a hearing in Chicago _ also contend that managed-care\ncompanies hinder those seeking mental health and drug abuse help\nbecause there is less chance they will resist. Over the last three\nyears or so, the attorneys general say, they have received\nincreasing numbers of such complaints from doctors, clinics and\npatients.\n\n   ``You're dealing with a population that is especially\nvulnerable,'' said Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general in New\nYork, whose office has set up a health care bureau to pursue\ncomplaints against managed-care companies. And because of that\nvulnerability, he said, ``We believe they think they have a greater\nlatitude to deny care and escape the sanctions that should be\nimposed on them.''\n\n   Organizations that represent the managed-care industry deny any\nsuch intent, and contend _ though the statistics to back it up are\nseveral years old _ that the advent of managed care has made those\nservices, especially for mental health care, available to a wider\npopulation by helping to bring down prices of visits to\npsychologists and stays in clinics.\n\n   ``If the states' attorneys general are going to make this\nassertion, we would certainly like to see how they plan to back it\nup,'' said Pamela Greenberg, executive director of the American\nManaged Behavioral Healthcare Association, which represents\nmanaged-care companies specializing in mental health and substance\nabuse care.\n\n   In the case of Payton, Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna,\nsaid Tuesday that the company still maintained that his individual\npolicy did not cover what he was seeking. He was finally granted\ncoverage, she said, because ``a decision was made to make an\nexception _ that his case was such that it warranted one.''\n\n   ``But by then unfortunately his drug problems were such that\nthis happened,'' she said, ``and it was a tragedy.''\n\n   nn\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Robert Payton's mother had a premonition that she\nwould never see her son again when she dropped him off at the ferry\nin Weehawken, N.J., that muggy day last summer. ``She turned around\nto wave goodbye to him from the car,'' recalled Payton's sister,\nMaureen Hussey, ``and she didn't see him.
