That kind of lingers.''\n\n   Carter, honorary chairwoman of the President's Commission on\nMental Health in her husband's administration, these days tries to\neducate the public about mental illness through the Carter Center\nin Atlanta.

She suggested schools\nshould have mental-health professionals available for students.\n\n   And that help should be available for the families of the\nmentally ill, Cater said. Support groups, she added, are key in\nhelping people understand and help their mentally ill relatives.\n\n   Former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the event, said it was\nsignificant that someone as high-profile as a former first lady was\nwilling to speak out about mental health.\n\n   ``It will give it attention that we would not otherwise get,''\nCleaver said.\n","Headline":"\nFORMER FIRST LADY ROSALYNN CARTER URGES STRONGER EFFORTS IN\nTREATING MENTAL ILLNESS \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mental-health treatment has come a long way,\nbut more needs to be done to ensure that people who suffer mental\nillness _ and their loved ones _ get the help they need, former\nfirst lady Rosalynn Carter said here Monday night.\n","\n   ``I've worked in the mental-health field since 1971,'' Carter\nsaid at a news conference before speaking at the Hyatt Regency\nCrown Center hotel. ``At that time nobody would talk about mental\nillness.''\n","\n   In recent years, Carter said, knowledge of mental health and how\nto treat mental illness has grown.\n","\n   But, Carter said, ``that stigma still exists.''\n","\n   ``It all goes back to when we didn't understand mental\nillness,'' Carter said. ``To the time when we shut them away and\ndidn't want anyone to know about it.
