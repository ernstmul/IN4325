But the latest science shows\nbiological aspects to psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric\naspects to neurological disorders, according to the article by\nneurologists Bruce H. Price and Raymond D. Adams, and psychiatrist\nJoseph T. Coyle.\n\n   ``The two disciplines working together gives far more hope than\ncontinuing these old turf wars,'' said Price, chairman of the\ndepartment of neurology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., in an\ninterview. Price, the lead author, is also on the staff of\nMassachusetts General Hospital and the faculty of Harvard Medical\nSchool.\n\n   The article, meant to stir controversy and debate among the\nnearly 13,000 members of the American Academy of Neurology, calls\nfor changes in the medical education of both neurologists and\npsychiatrists, and for better academic leadership in encouraging\ncollaboration between the two disciplines.\n\n   Massachusetts has one of the highest per capita concentrations\nof neurologists in the country, with nearly 10 members of the\nneurology academy for every 100,000 people, according to the\nacademy's Web site, making it particularly noteworthy that the\narticle in Neurology is authored by Massachusetts scientists, Price\nsaid.\n\n   Neurology, as a practice, involves the study and treatment of\ndiseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological\ndisorders, while psychiatry looks at ailments like depression,\nschizophrenia and other mental illnesses.\n\n   There has already been cross-fertilization in the two\ndisciplines, with such recent subspecialties as biological\npsychiatry and neuropsychiatry, and with the National Institute of\nMental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases\nand Stroke making multidisciplinary grants.\n\n   A proposed new Neuroscience Center at the National Institutes of\nHealth is expected to tie together neuroscience research being\nconducted at NIMH, NINDS and seven other institutes.\n\n   But specialists in the field said there needs to be even more\nsuch collaboration, and welcomed the article in the journal\nNeurology.\n\n   ``I agree wholeheartedly with everything in it,'' said Dr. Robin\nBrey, chairwoman of the American Academy of Neurology's\nprofessional and public information committee. The ``most important\npoint about this article,'' she said, is its summary of the latest\nevidence that allows doctors to ``refine our viewpoints, update our\nviewpoints and our theories.''\n\n   Among the evidence cited in the article for making the case that\nthe biology of the brain and psychiatry of the mind are\ninseparable: Brain imaging scans that allow researchers to see\ndifferences in people with and without mental illness; studies of\nthe amazing plasticity of the brain, with neurons growing in\nresponse to environmental stimuli, like learning; and brain imaging\nresearch showing that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder who\nrespond to either behavioral therapy or medication both show the\nsame biologic changes.\n\n   ``Brain vs. mind. . .it used to be either/or, nature or nurture.\nWhat we're saying is it's really both,'' said Price.\n","Headline":"\nSCIENTISTS CALL FOR END TO NEUROLOGY-PSYCHIATRY `DIVIDE' \n","Text":["\n   The turf battle between neurologists and psychiatrists has\nhistorically been so intense that a medical official once said that\ngetting them ``to sit down together without police present was in\nitself an accomplishment.''\n","\n   It may not really be necessary for law enforcement to intervene\nbetween the two disciplines, but there is nevertheless a ``great\ndivide'' that must be closed if research and treatment are to\nadvance more quickly, says a group of Harvard scientists from both\nfields.\n","\n   In an article published Tuesday in the journal Neurology,\nresearchers say the animosity of the past stems from a difference\nof thinking about what causes disease _ the biology of the brain\nvs. the psychiatry of the mind.
