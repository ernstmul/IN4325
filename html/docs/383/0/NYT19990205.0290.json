Hyman, who left Boston more than two years ago to\nhead the nation's mental health research agency, also won approval\nFriday for a more stringent review of proposed studies to induce\npsychosis or withdraw or deny medication from mentally ill\nvolunteers.\n\n   ``We are not going to be funding research that will produce\nharm,'' Hyman said at a meeting of the National Advisory Mental\nHealth Council, which unanimously approved his plan to create a new\ngrant review subcommittee. That panel will be composed of council\nmembers, outside bioethicists, and people with mental illness or\ntheir family members.\n\n   The suspended studies used ketamine, an approved anesthetic drug\nthat also is abused on the streets for its hallucinogenic\nproperties under such names as ``Special K.''\n\n   ``Those (studies) on our campus have stopped,'' Hyman said in an\ninterview, adding that new subjects had not been enrolled in\nketamine studies at the Bethesda-based institute for about a year.\nThe institute is now reviewing its funding of outside research\ninvolving ketamine, Hyman said.\n\n   Ketamine has been used in people with mental illness and in\nhealthy ``volunteers'' to study the biology of psychosis. In a\nfour-part series three months ago, The Boston Globe focused\nattention on reports of harm done to some mentally ill volunteers\nby studies that involved administering ketamine and other drugs or\nwithdrawing or denying medication for research purposes.\n\n   Hyman and other officials at the National Institute of Mental\nHealth have said their review of the studies began before the Globe\nseries. But an article two weeks ago in the journal Science cited\nthe ``devastating four-part series full of research horror\nstories'' as having mobilized the agency to step up its efforts.\n\n   Other publications also have focused on the issue. Hyman called\nsome accounts sensational, but acknowledged that they highlighted a\ngrowing public mistrust of research.\n\n   ``What will chill and kill clinical research will be the loss of\npublic trust,'' he said in proposing the new review process.\n\n   Institute officials said their ketamine studies had been\nsuspended for lack of scientific merit following a review last\nmonth, but they denied that patients had been harmed. If study\ndesigns are improved, that line of research could start up again,\nsaid Clarissa Wittenberg, an institute spokeswoman.\n\n   Hyman said the agency is studying its options on how to proceed\nwith outside ketamine research it funds. Yale University, the\nUniversity of Maryland, and others are among those receiving\ninstitute funding for ketamine studies.\n\n   The agency could do anything from alerting outside researchers\nof its concerns to suspending funding, Wittenberg said. ``We could\ndo a great deal,'' she said, adding that ``the message is getting\nout pretty clearly on where the institute is standing on all of\nthis.''\n\n   The institute's actions have angered some psychiatric\nresearchers who are concerned that it will have a chilling effect\non scientific advancement, but it earned praise from people with\nmental illness and their advocates. Hyman said he has received\n``hate mail'' from some researchers and fan letters from advocates.\n\n   In the journal Science two weeks ago, a number of scientists\ncriticized Hyman's proposal for an extra subcommittee to review\nstudies that induce psychosis or withdraw medications.\n\n   But one professional organization, the American Psychiatric\nAssociation, put its support squarely behind the new review process\nFriday. In a statement, Dr. Steven M. Mirin, medical director of\nthe 40,000-member group, said: ``The issue is how to craft\nprotections for research participants so they do not unnecessarily\nand inappropriately impinge on the pursuit of new treatments of\nthese devastating disorders. The proposals . . . meet this test.''\n\n   Some advocates, however, said the institute is not doing enough.\nAdil Shamoo, a University of Maryland bioethicist, welcomed the\nsuspension of the ketamine studies but added, ``The important\nquestion is, are they stopped temporarily or permanently?''\n\n   Shamoo and Vera Hassner Sharav, cofounders of the New York-based\nCitizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research, have\ncalled for a moratorium on studies that induce psychosis or\nwithdraw medications.\n\n   In another effort to make research more accountable, the\nNational Institute of Mental Health also won approval for a plan\nthat would, for the first time, add lay people to some of its\nresearch review groups, known as ``study sections.''
