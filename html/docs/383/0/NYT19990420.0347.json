WREN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Arizona, the first state to begin treating all its nonviolent\ndrug offenders rather than locking them up, says its new policy of\ndiverting addicts from prison into treatment has already saved the\ntaxpayers money.\n\n   A report issued Tuesday by the Arizona Supreme Court estimated\nthat the state's new program saved more than $2.5 million in its\nfirst fiscal year of operation, which ended in June 1998, and looks\nlikely to reap greater savings in the future. The report determined\nthe savings by calculating the difference in cost between locking\nup a prisoner and putting the prisoner on probation and in\ntreatment.\n\n   The results come as the nation's prisons and jails overflow with\n1.8 million inmates, 400,000 of whom are addicted to drugs. The\nWhite House's director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry\nMcCaffrey, has said he wants to reduce the prison population by\n250,000 through promoting options for treatment.\n\n   From California to Connecticut, many states now spend more on\nprisons than on higher education, making the Arizona model a\nconspicuous alternative to building more prisons for offenders who\ncommitted drug-related crimes to support their habits. At the end\nof 1998, New York had 22,386 drug felons incarcerated in its state\nprisons at an annual cost of more than $700 million, according to\nthe Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit group that\nmonitors prison sentencing in New York.\n\n   Of 2,622 people on probation diverted into treatment in Arizona,\nthe report said said, 77.5 percent have subsequently tested free of\ndrugs, which is a significantly higher rate than for offenders on\nprobation in most other states. And 77.1 percent of Arizona drug\nusers on probation, who are expected to contribute to the cost of\ntheir treatment, made at least one payment. Arizona has 25,000\npeople behind bars, a majority of whom have drug problems.\n\n   Unlike the drug courts springing up around the country, which\noffer offenders treatment as an alternative to trial and a criminal\nrecord, Arizona sentences drug offenders to treatment once they\nhave been convicted or plead guilty, but tailors the regimen to the\nkind of drug dependency that the offender has.\n\n   Arizona finances the treatment through a luxury tax levied on\nalcohol sold in the state, with half of the revenue going to a\nparents' commission to run drug prevention and treatment programs.\nThe $3.1 million in alcohol tax revenue used to treat offenders is\nin addition to $3.2 million a year previously earmarked by the\nstate Legislature, said Barbara Broderick, the state director of\nadult probation.\n\n   ``Treatment works when it's done right,'' Ms. Broderick said in\na telephone interview from Phoenix. ``Early and meaningful\nintervention probably has the best payback in making sure we are\nsafe'' from new crimes by addicts, she said. ``When I put treatment\nwith probation, it changes the odds.''\n\n   But Ms. Broderick added, ``When we can't get someone to change,\nwe send them to prison. You can't continue to waste resources.''\n\n   The report, which Ms. Broderick edited, said that diverting drug\noffenders into treatment saved Arizona $5,053,014 in prison costs\nin the 1998 fiscal year. Deducting probation costs and other\nexpenses incurred by the Drug Treatment and Education Fund, the\nprogram's formal name, the net saving was $2,563,062. The report\nanticipated that the savings would increase in the current fiscal\nyear as more offenders were channeled into treatment or finished\nprobation.\n\n   Judge Rudy Gerber of Arizona's Court of Appeals called the\nstate's new public health approach a welcome improvement over ``the\nrevolving-door experience of drug offenders.''\n\n   ``It was like a turnstile,'' said Gerber, who has been hearing\ncases of drug offenders in Arizona for 25 years. ``Many of us came\nto the conclusion that we were parading them through the courts and\nprisons without solving the root problem.'' Now, he said, an\noffender convicted of possession of a modest amount of cocaine in\nArizona gets probation with mandatory treatment. ``The same guy in\nthe federal system is going to get a mandatory five-year\nsentence,'' Gerber said.\n\n   The Arizona Supreme Court report said it costs $16.06 a day to\nsubject someone on probation to intensive supervision, including\ndrug treatment and counseling, compared with $50 a day to keep an\ninmate in prison.\n\n   Norman Helber, the chief of adult probation for Maricopa County,\nwhich has accounted for 56.6 percent of the arrests for drug sale\nor possession in Arizona, said the new treatment approach ``has\nbeen fantastic from the field perspective.'' He said Maricopa\nCounty, which includes Phoenix, handles 39,000 people on probation\na year, many of whom have substance abuse problems.\n\n   Helber attributed the change in public opinion to the mounting\ncost of locking up drug offenders: ``I thought it was extremely\nwise of a broad base of taxpayers in an extremely conservative\nstate to say, we're not going to rely just on prisons anymore.''\n\n   The treatment option was an element of Proposition 200, formally\ncalled the Drug Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act, which\nvoters approved in November 1998 by 65 percent to 35 percent. The\nstate Legislature balked at enacting it, in part because the\nreferendum also endorsed the use of marijuana and other drugs for\nmedicinal purposes as long as two doctors prescribed it in writing.\nThe proposition was presented again last year to state voters, who\napproved it again, this time by 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\n   Charles Blanchard, a former Arizona state legislator who is now\nchief counsel for the White House's Office of National Drug Control\nPolicy, said that even before Arizona's program became law,\noffenders convicted in the state of just possessing drugs were\nrarely sent to prison, and that some offenders caught selling drugs\nplea-bargained their sentences down to probation, as it happens in\nother states.\n\n   But the referendum made a sizable amount of money available for\ndrug treatment, Blanchard said. And mandating treatment, he said,\n``caused decision makers to say now that prison isn't even an\noption, so what do we do with the offenders? In the past, many of\nthese people would get lost in the probation system with nothing\nreally done.''\n","Headline":"\nARIZONA SAVES MONEY BY TREATING, RATHER THAN JAILING, DRUG\nOFFENDERS \n","Text":["\n   Arizona, the first state to begin treating all its nonviolent\ndrug offenders rather than locking them up, says its new policy of\ndiverting addicts from prison into treatment has already saved the\ntaxpayers money.\n","\n   A report issued Tuesday by the Arizona Supreme Court estimated\nthat the state's new program saved more than $2.5 million in its\nfirst fiscal year of operation, which ended in June 1998, and looks\nlikely to reap greater savings in the future.
