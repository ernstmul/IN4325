There are\nno drugs to directly treat the disorder, although in some cases\ndrugs are used to control aggressive and self-destructive behavior.\n\n   Many autistic youngsters also suffer from gastrointestinal\nproblems such as repeated diarrhea.\n\n   Repligen maintains that multiple doses _ not the single dose\nresults chronicled in the New England Journal of Medicine _ will\nlead to changes in behavior.\n\n   ``Kids whose diarrhea disappears in 48 hours after taking\nsecretin tend to have normal stools and very often this leads to\nimprovement in autistic symptoms, such as better eye contact,\nimproved communications and trailing after siblings,'' said Walter\nC. Herlihy, Repligen president and chief executive, officer whose\n8-year-old daughter Lilian is autistic.\n\n   He explained that in March, a Wall Street Journal article\nrevealed some promising results based on anecdotal evidence from\nover 1,000 autistic patients who had used secretin as an\nexperimental drug. Those findings prompted a group of investors in\nAshville, N.C. to sponsor a formal clinical trial. However, they\nrelied on a single dose of secretin with four weeks of observation.\n\n   ``What they did is analogous to measuring behavioral changes in\nan Alzheimer patient with one dose of a drug,'' said Herlihy. ``We\nhave always said a single dose does not produce significant\nresults.''\n","Headline":"\nREGPLIGEN AUTISM DRUG IN SINGLE   DOSE SAID DEFICIENT \n","Text":["\n   Repligen Corp. said Wednesday that secretin, its drug to treat\nautism, does not appear to work after a single injection, although\ncompany officials predicted that more positive results will appear\nwith higher doses.\n","\n   The Needham, Mass. biotechnology company said the New England\nJournal of Medicine will publish Thursday a study by a North\nCarolina group that independently tested the drug on 18 patients.\n``A single dose of synthetic human secretin is not an effective\ntreatment for autism or pervasive developmental disorder,'' the\nstudy concluded.\n","\n   Repligen, which owns the drug, was not involved in the\nevaluation but plans to launch its own test early next year with\nabout 100 autistic children taking multiple doses over three or\nfour months.\n","\n   Repligen stock closed Wednesday at 3 3/16, up 3/16.\n","\n   Autism affects 500,000 Americans and is a disorder in which a\nyoung child cannot develop normal social relationships.
