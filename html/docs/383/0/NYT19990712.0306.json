Times News Service   \n\n   ST. LOUIS _ Barrett Toan calls himself a silent partner in the\nhealth care system and if President Clinton has his way, there will\nbe many more like him.\n\n   Toan is the president of Express Scripts Inc., which supervises\nthe filling of 295 million prescriptions a year for 47 million\npeople with private health insurance. In calling for Medicare\ncoverage of prescription drugs, Clinton wants to see Express\nScripts and similar companies play the same role for 39 million\nolder Americans and disabled people.\n\n   While such companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, have\nbeen popular for a decade or so, most consumers have only a vague\nidea of the powerful force they exert over which drugs are sold and\nwhich pharmacies sell them.\n\n   With the plastic identification cards issued by Express Scripts\nand similar companies, a patient can walk into a pharmacy, hand\nover $10 and walk out with $70 worth of medicine. The pharmacy\nbenefit manager negotiates the complex arrangements behind that\ntransaction.\n\n   Clinton would give such companies a great new responsibility,\nmanaging drug benefits for Medicare patients, who use a third of\nall drugs prescribed in the United States. But that shift would\nalso illuminate some practices that have largely escaped public\nnotice, including the power of pharmacy benefit managers to affect\ndoctors' decisions and their dealings with drug companies. The\narrangements, which include rebates from the drug companies to the\nmanagers for giving preference to certain drugs, would become much\nmore visible.\n\n   Pharmacy benefit managers organize the market for prescription\ndrugs, securing deep discounts from drug manufacturers and retail\npharmacies for large employers or health plans. They try to\ninfluence doctors' prescribing habits and encourage the use of\nlower-cost drugs, including generic substitutes for brand-name\nmedicines. They strongly recommend certain drugs over others in\neach therapeutic category _ antihistamines and treatments for high\ncholesterol or high blood pressure, for example.\n\n   In some ways, pharmacy benefit managers are like health\nmaintenance organizations: they try to control the cost of care. So\nfar, they have not engendered widespread hostility among consumers,\nas some HMOs have.\n\n   ``We think we could play a useful role in Medicare,'' Toan said\nin an interview at his headquarters here. ``We help consumers get\nthe maximum value for the dollars they spend on pharmaceuticals.\nMany elderly patients are paying prices 20 to 25 percent higher\nthan what our customers pay because they don't get the type of\ndiscounts we can negotiate.''\n\n   But doctors and pharmacists have expressed concern about the\nmarket power of pharmacy benefit managers. While Express Scripts is\nindependently owned, some of its chief competitors are owned by\ndrug companies and drugstores.\n\n   ``Our offices are besieged with faxes and phone calls urging us\nto change the drugs we prescribe for patients,'' said Dr. Raymond\nScalettar, a Washington rheumatologist. ``It's very troubling, very\nintrusive, and not necessarily in the patients' best interest.''\n\n   Some people are equally troubled by the practice of drug\nmanufacturers' giving cash rebates to the pharmacy benefit managers\nin return for having their products included on the list of\npreferred drugs. Pharmacists worry that some drugs may be chosen\nmore for their rebates than for their efficacy. The terms of rebate\nagreements are considered proprietary information and are a\ncarefully guarded secret.\n\n   Such concerns would grow if these companies managed drug\nbenefits for Medicare recipients.\n\n   The president's plan to cover prescription drugs is part of his\nproposal to reorganize Medicare to make it more competitive and\nfinancially secure as members of the baby boom generation approach\nretirement age. Administration officials see pharmacy benefit\nmanagers as a way to prevent explosive growth in the cost of\nMedicare drug benefits without resorting to federal price controls,\nwhich are anathema to drug makers.\n\n   Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser, who\nhelped design Clinton's Medicare proposal, said, ``There are no\nprice controls in this.''\n\n   Rather, Sperling said, the government would simply get\n``reasonable discounts,'' like other health plans that buy large\nquantities of drugs.\n\n   Nationwide, pharmacy benefit managers handled 1.8 billion\nprescriptions last year. Employers, labor unions and private health\nplans have increasingly turned to such companies to control drug\nspending, which has grown much faster than other health spending in\nrecent years.\n\n   A study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm\nof Congress, found that pharmacy benefit managers had reduced the\ncost of drug benefits for federal employees by 20 percent to 27\npercent.\n\n   Drug benefit managers develop networks of retail pharmacies that\nmay include thousands of drugstores. In return for a large volume\nof business, the drugstores must give discounts. Under a typical\narrangement, a drugstore receives the average wholesale price for a\ndrug, minus 15 percent. The pharmacist also gets a small dispensing\nfee, perhaps $2 for each prescription.\n\n   Elderly people often pay the highest prices for prescription\ndrugs because their purchasing power is fragmented. Under Clinton's\nproposal, the government would hire a private company in each\nregion of the country to manage drug benefits for the large numbers\nof Medicare patients who are still in the traditional\nfee-for-service program.\n\n   Howard J. Bedlin, vice president of the National Council on the\nAging, a research and advocacy group, said, ``There's an emerging\nconsensus that pharmacy benefit managers have an important role to\nplay in Medicare reform, but you have to build in certain consumer\nprotections'' to guarantee the confidentiality of patients' records\nand to inform consumers of any restrictions on their choice of\ndrugs.\n\n   Express Scripts, like other pharmacy benefit managers, reviews\nprescriptions before they are filled at retail drugstores across\nthe country. The pharmacies file claims electronically. Express\nScripts can immediately tell the pharmacist if the customer has\ninsurance and how much of a co-payment to charge.\n\n   In addition, Express Scripts has records of other drugs that a\npatient has bought. This allows it to tell the pharmacist if the\nnew drug would duplicate an existing prescription, if it could\ncause harmful interactions with other drugs or if a prescription is\nbeing refilled too early. The company at this point could also\nnotify the pharmacist if another drug or a generic is preferred.\n\n   While employers and HMOs praise the work of drug benefit\nmanagers, many doctors and pharmacists have had frustrating\nexperiences.\n\n   Edward F. Dillon, co-owner of Grubb's Pharmacy, a century-old\nstore on Capitol Hill in Washington, said he understood the need to\nhold down health costs but had been exasperated by the techniques\nof pharmacy benefit managers.\n\n   ``In some cases,'' Dillon said, ``you have a college-age\ncustomer service representative calling a doctor with 30 years of\nexperience and asking, `What is your medical justification for this\ndrug?'''\n\n   John M. Rector, general counsel of the National Community\nPharmacists Association, which represents 35,000 independent\npharmacies, said the preferences for certain drugs were often based\non ``back-room deals that the consumer never knows about.''\n\n   For example, Rector said, a pharmacy benefit manager ``sometimes\ntells the pharmacist to dispense a more expensive, inappropriate\nbrand-name drug because the PBM is getting a rebate or kickback\nfrom the manufacturer.''\n\n   But Toan said most of the money from cash rebates was passed on\nto the sponsor of a health plan, reducing the overall cost of drug\nbenefits for patients.\n\n   Toan, a former director of the Missouri Social Services\nDepartment, said Express Scripts was ``the nation's largest\nindependent pharmacy benefit manager.'' PCS Health Systems of\nScottsdale, Ariz., another benefit manager, has been owned since\nJanuary by Rite Aid, the drugstore chain. Their biggest competitor,\nMerck-Medco Managed Care, is owned by Merck & Co., the drug\nmanufacturer.\n\n   Express Scripts manages $10 billion a year in drug spending for\nits clients, which include Bethlehem Steel and Blue Cross and Blue\nShield of Missouri.\n\n   Stuart L. Bascomb, executive vice president of Express Scripts,\nsaid some drugs would not be affordable for many people without the\ndiscounts obtained by pharmacy benefit managers. The average retail\nprescription price of common cholesterol-lowering drugs, for\nexample, is $100 a month, or $1,200 a year.\n\n   In one respect, Medicare is different from other clients of\nExpress Scripts. Toan, the president of the company, refused to\ngive details of its contracts with drug manufacturers and\npharmacies. But Congress and the public would probably insist on\nknowing the details of any discounts negotiated on behalf of\nMedicare patients.\n\n   The comptroller general of the United States would want to audit\nMedicare's drug spending. Medicare officials would be tempted to\nregulate the activities of pharmacy benefit managers to protect\nMedicare patients and to save taxpayers' money. Pharmacists would\ndemand an explanation if they were excluded from the list of\ndrugstores serving Medicare beneficiaries in a particular region.\n\n   Even with the best efforts of drug benefit managers, Toan said,\n``Medicare, like commercial health plans, would probably face\ndouble-digit increases in drug costs, in the range of 15 percent a\nyear.''\n\n   Under Clinton's proposal, beneficiaries would have to pay half\nof any drug costs covered by Medicare.\n\n   ``That would serve as a check against unnecessary use of\nmedicines,'' Toan said. On the other hand, he said, ``a lot of new\nmedicines will address conditions of the elderly, and that might\nkeep up a fairly steep increase in drug spending.''\n\n   Independent pharmacists complain that they have little\nopportunity to negotiate with pharmacy benefit managers because\ncontracts are offered to them on a ``take it or leave it'' basis.\nThey say payments are so low that they often lose $5 or more on a\n$50 prescription.\n\n   In response, Toan said, ``That's our job, to seek the lowest\nprice we can get for our customers.''\n","Headline":"\nCLINTON'S MEDICARE PROPOSAL CALLS ATTENTION TO PRACTICES OF\nPHARMACY MANAGERS  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   ST.
