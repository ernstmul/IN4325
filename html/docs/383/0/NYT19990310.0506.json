Friday night he delivers case\nhistories of what he says represents the latest fashion in\nsociety's noncare: confining the mentally ill in jail.\n\n   Although Rivera is in a relatively sober mode, his program's\nproduction effects are as frenetic as ever, loading on the most\nsensational images available of violence and commotion. That is\nparticularly unfortunate, not only for their slow-motion,\nfast-motion triteness and their reminder of Rivera's reputation\nbefore reform gripped him, but also because this time his material\nis worth attention.\n\n   From Louisiana to California to Tennessee to Colorado, he finds\npeople with schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses consigned\nto the company of criminals rather than sick people. The\nconsequence for perhaps a million inmates, who Rivera says are\n``caught between good intentions and broken promises,'' seems to be\nat best inadequate care and too often abuse by guards trained to\nsubdue their charges rather than assist them.\n\n   Especially painful are the accounts of parents who find that the\nonly way they can get some sort of medical attention for their\nchildren is to have them convicted of a felony. Yet the examples\nfeatured here of what goes on in the generally jammed prisons _\nfights among prisoners, isolation cells and tough nonlove _ are not\nreassuring.\n\n   At best, Rivera reports, the ill may receive drugs but not much\nelse that passes for treatment.
