George W. Bush a chance to demonstrate his\ncommitment to ``compassionate conservatism'' and to patch some\nchinks in his presidential armor, according to political and mental\nhealth experts.\n\n   The GOP front-runner could get that opportunity as early as\nFriday, depending on action by the Texas Board of Pardons and\nParoles.\n\n   Scheduled for lethal injection Tuesday is Larry Keith Robison _\na 42-year-old paranoid schizophrenic convicted of a 1982 sexual\nmutilation and slaying in which trial testimony suggested the\npossibility of cannibalism.\n\n   Parole board members hope to have a recommendation for or\nagainst clemency to the governor in the Robison case by Friday\nafternoon. However, that could be delayed to allow the 18-member\nboard time to review supplemental documents the inmate's family and\nsupporters provided the board Wednesday, according to board\nchairman Gerald Garrett.\n\n   Granting Robison clemency ``might help (Bush), especially\nbecause of the impact of the Talk magazine interview concerning\nKarla Faye Tucker,'' said Larry Sabato, a political science\nprofessor at the University of Virginia who follows presidential\ncampaigns. ``This would be a way for Bush to demonstrate compassion\nand put the interview behind him.''\n\n   Bush has drawn fire this week over that interview because it\nportrays him as mocking Tucker's execution, although Bush aides say\nhe was not making light of the Houston pickax murderer. Tucker, who\nsaid she was a born-again Christian, was put to death last year\namid an international outcry to spare her life. She was the first\nwoman executed in Texas in more that 100 years.\n\n   Under Texas law, Bush cannot commute Robison's death sentence to\nlife imprisonment unless the parole board recommends such action;\nhowever, all of its members were appointed by him.\n\n   The only independent action a governor can take in halting an\nexecution is to grant a single 30-day delay. Bush, however, has not\ntaken that action in any of the 99 executions that have taken place\nsince he was sworn into office in January 1995. Only once has the\nboard recommended clemency, and Bush granted it.\n\n   For the governor to allow the execution to proceed ``would be an\nindictment against every'' American whose family is touched by\nmental health issues, said Melodee Smith of Florida, Robison's\nclemency attorney.\n\n   ``No one can fathom the notion that Gov. Bush _ a very\ncompassionate individual _ would want to execute a mentally ill\nman. The entire mental health community is calling on him to\nconsider this very seriously and then to be compassionate about\nit.''  \n\n     Sabato said Bush and other Republican governors have far more\nfreedom to commute a death sentence than their Democratic\ncounterparts do.\n\n   ``Democratic governors have very little flexibility on the death\npenalty,'' Sabato added. ``They are assumed to be soft on the death\npenalty, and therefore any push toward clemency by them can hurt\nthem politically. ... But a Republican governor is assumed to be\nstrongly in favor of the death penalty. They can politically get\naway with the occasional grant of clemency because it does moderate\ntheir image a bit.''\n\n   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor will make his\ndecision after the parole board makes a recommendation.\n\n   She said the controversial nature of Robison's case is not an\nissue. ``The death penalty itself is controversial, but Gov. Bush\nis sworn to uphold the laws of the state.''\n\n   In their quest to spare Robison, the inmate's family and\nsupporters also are indicting Texas' mental health care system.\n\n   ``When Larry was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, we tried\nto get help for him from every mental hospital in Texas and every\nagency that we could find out about,'' said Lois Robison, the\ninmate's mother.\n\n   The former schoolteacher has been speaking out about the metal\nhealth system ever since her son was sent to death row. ``We were\ntold repeatedly that unless he became violent, Larry could not be\ncommitted for the long-term treatment that he needed.''\n\n   Adds Robert Hager, vice president for Capacity for Justice, a\nHouston-based organization that promotes humane treatment of\nmentally ill defendants:\n\n   ``If the state of Texas had provided effective medication and\nintensive care management to those Texans who suffer from severe\nbrain disorders and are incarcerated for acts of violence, many of\nthose acts would never have occurred.''\n\n     \n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   In a letter to the parole board, Sheila C. Mullins, president of\nthe Mental Health Association in Texas, emphasized the lack of\ntreatment for Robison.  \n\n     ``As a result of his untreated illness, Mr. Robison eventually\ndegenerated into a state of violence,'' she said. ``The\nresponsibility for the loss of five precious lives must be shared\nbetween Mr. Robison and the system that failed him long before he\nturned violent.''\n\n     \n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Nuncio\nfor the United States, urged clemency for Robison on behalf of Pope\nJohn Paul II, writing Bush: ``A life sentence without the\npossibility of parole provides substantial safeguards for society\nand represents an adequately grave punishment for the accused.''\n\n   But the gruesome details in Robison's case make it difficult for\nsome to offer any sympathy.\n\n   In Fort Worth      on Aug. 10, 1982, Robison _ then a 24-year-old\nunemployed veteran who was severely delusional _ decapitated his\nhomosexual roommate, sexually mutilated him and then killed four\npeople next door, including a woman and her 11-year-old son,\naccording to trial testimony.\n\n   Police cited indications that Robison might have cannibalized\nhis roommate, Ricky Lee Bryant, after killing him and\nfingerpainting on the walls in his blood.\n\n   Although charged with murdering Bryant, Robison was convicted of\nmurdering Bruce M. Gardner, 33, who had stopped by to see his\ngirlfriend, Georgia Ann Reed, 34. Robison also was charged with\nmurdering Reed; her son, Scott, and her mother, Earline H. Barker,\n55.\n\n   He confessed to all the slayings.\n\n   Robison was diagnosed in the 1970s with paranoid schizophrenia,\nbut trial testimony indicated that a long history of drug abuse _\nincluding LSD and PCP _ may have contributed to his delusional\nstate. He also had a history on run-ins with the law, primarily\ntheft and drug arrests.\n\n   According to published reports, Brian Gardner of Fort Worth, the\nbrother of one of the victims, said he doesn't buy Robison's mental\nillness claims.\n\n   ``That's just a scheme cooked up by his lawyers and family,''\nGardner told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``If you ask me, he was\njust a dope freak.''\n\n   Parole chairman Garrett says the gist of the arguments filed on\nRobison's behalf deal with his mental illness. Robison, however, is\nnot the first prisoner to have raised such issues.\n\n   ``In general terms when the mental health issue is raised, then\nwe tend to get communication from people who have strong feelings\nabout the delivery of services that the state is providing,''\nGarrett said. ``... We are hearing from people not only that are in\nopposition to the death penalty but we also are hearing from people\nthat have strong feelings about the mental health system in the\nstate and the nation.''\n\n   He said the board has received more letters of support for\nRobison than in many death penalty cases, but fewer than the number\nsupporting clemency for Tucker.\n\n   He also said the board does not consider the political\nimplications for Bush.\n\n   ``Those are forces beyond us,'' he added. ``We're staying\nfocused on answering the issues before us. I truly don't know as to\npolitically what the impact might be.
