Times News Service   \n\n   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. _ Mental health care advocates long viewed\nSouth Florida State Psychiatric Hospital here as a dumping ground,\na place where patients were treated poorly, languished for years\nand died mysteriously.\n\n   South Florida State, only a few years ago threatened with\nclosing as the way to solve its problems, is now at the heart of an\nexperiment. Experts say it is the first state mental hospital in\nthe nation to be turned over completely to a private company that\nhopes to operate it at a profit.\n\n   In 1997 legislators in Florida, which was involved in a long\ncourt battle to improve conditions at the hospital, voted to\ncontract out its operation. The winning bidder was a subsidiary of\nWackenhut Corrections Corp., one of the companies that started the\nboom in private-enterprise prisons a decade ago.\n\n   Many local advocates for the mentally ill were initially\nhorrified that a prison company was taking over a mental hospital,\nbut they now say that conditions here have improved. For example,\npatients, rather than staying indefinitely, are put into treatment\nprograms intended to get them out.\n\n   Wackenhut Corrections officials say they are making money but\nrefuse to say how much. The company is paid $32 million a year to\noperate the hospital, its budget when it was run by the Florida\nDepartment of Children and Families. The company's profit will come\nfrom cost savings.\n\n   Since taking over the hospital in November 1998, the Wackenhut\nsubsidiary, Atlantic Shores Healthcare, has reduced full-time\npositions to 500 from 720, and it plans to cut 80 more jobs, to pay\nfor a new building.\n\n   George Zoley, the chief executive of Wackenhut Corrections, said\nfurther staff reductions would not affect care because the new\nbuilding would centralize the hospital's operation, making it\neasier to manage.\n\n   Some mental health experts say they fear that Wackenhut is\nspending more at South Florida State now than it will in the future\nbecause its track record there will help it market itself to other\nstates.\n\n   ``If they are going to use this as a poster facility to win\ncontracts in other states, they ought to be operating it in the\nblack,'' said Patty Cooper, a program director in Florida with the\nAdvocacy Center, a federally funded group that works on behalf on\nthe mentally disabled.\n\n   A growing number of states have contracted with private\ncompanies to operate mental health services, including community\nclinics, substance abuse programs and homes for troubled youth.\nWith billions of dollars involved, companies large and small have\njumped into the arena, promising to operate programs more\nefficiently and effectively than public agencies.\n\n   While some mental health experts say privatization has led to\nimproved services in some states, programs elsewhere have collapsed\namid accusations that companies shortchanged patients or even\nabused them.\n\n   ``It is a vast social experiment at this point whether private\ncompanies can serve as effective intermediaries to coordinate\nhealth care,'' said Steven Findlay, research director at the\nNational Institute for Health Care Management, a nonprofit group in\nWashington. ``And mental health care is a lot more pragmatic than\nhealth care in general''\n\n   Amid this transition, the 260 state psychiatric hospitals\nnationwide have largely resisted such change.\n\n   The number of such hospitals has been sharply cut. Because of\nmoves over the past decade to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill,\nthe number of patients has dropped just as sharply, to 59,000 in\n1996 from about 560,000 in 1955, according to the Center for Mental\nHealth Services, a federal agency.\n\n   The hospitals now serve the most seriously ill patients, and\nfederal statistics suggest that states spend about half their\nmental health care budgets to operate them.\n\n   Some states have moved to close psychiatric hospitals and send\npatients to facilities owned by private companies that get patients\nwith private insurance.\n\n   The remaining public mental hospitals like South Florida State,\nwhich is west of Fort Lauderdale, are often remnants of a different\nera. South Florida State, which was opened in the late 1950s, is on\na campus dotted with low-slung cottages, ficuses and palms. Once\nhome to 1,500 patients, it now houses up to 350.\n\n   At South Florida State, the vast majority of patients are\ninvoluntarily committed by judges who determine that they are a\ndanger to themselves or others. Others are committed after being\nfound not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity.\n\n   While states sought out private companies to build prisons\nbecause they wanted more jail space, there are ample psychiatric\nhospital beds. Wackenhut's chief executive, Zoley, said there might\nbe another powerful incentive to privatize the hospitals: Many\nstates face court orders or Justice Department actions to improve\ncare at them.\n\n   ``We are approaching other states, and other states are\ninterested,'' Zoley said.\n\n   As with prisons, Zoley said, he believes that a company can\nimprove conditions and run a mental hospital more efficiently than\na state agency because it can, among other things, contract for\nservices quickly and cheaply.\n\n   For nearly a decade, South Florida State was at the center of a\nlegal battle. In 1989, mental health care advocates sued the state\nafter finding conditions at the hospital like a lack of toilets and\npatients wandering around naked, said Alice K. Nelson, a lawyer\nwith Southern Legal Counsel, a public interest law firm in\nGainesville.\n\n   In 1993, the state and advocates entered into a consent decree\nunder which Florida pledged to improve living conditions. But the\nadvocates, displeased with the pace of change, continued to fight\nin court over patient issues.\n\n   As the battle played out, Florida officials considered closing\nthe hospital. Then in 1997, the Florida Legislature voted to\nprivatize it, and the legislation was passed and signed by the\ngovernor.\n\n   ``It was an opportunity to do something different,'' said State\nRep. Debby Sanderson, a Fort Lauderdale Republican who was one of\nthe privatization bill's sponsors.\n\n   Several companies including Magellan Health Services, which\nadministers mental health programs for several states nationwide,\nexpressed interest. In the end Atlantic Shores Healthcare, which\nwas formed around the time of the Florida bill, was the only\nbidder.\n\n   The company's experience was limited. Wackenhut Corrections\nprovides psychiatric services to inmates in prisons it runs, and\nAtlantic Shores Healthcare bought a small private psychiatric\nhospital in 1997 in Fort Lauderdale as it prepared to bid on the\nFlorida contract.\n\n   Company officials quickly found, however, that running a large\nstate mental hospital involved far bigger challenges.\n\n   Under the state's operation, for example, patients at South\nFlorida State could smoke when they wanted, buy snacks when they\npleased or roam the hospital grounds if they desired. Atlantic\nShores Healthcare officials proposed banning smoking and restricted\naccess to vending machines.\n\n   ``Right away, they came in and brought in changes that affected\neveryone, and the patients didn't have a say in it,'' said Robert\nBowyer, who was treated at the hospital for manic depression.\n\n   Those changes stirred fears among some advocates for the\nmentally ill that the company was transferring its prison industry\nroots to a mental health setting. Officials soon backed off some\nchanges, like the proposed ban on smoking. Vending machines were\nkept in place, but color-coded to alert patients with diabetes, for\nexample, to snacks that are laden with sugar.\n\n   nn\n","Headline":"\nEXPERIMENT OF PRIVATIZING A FLORIDA MENTAL HOSPITAL SHOWS\nBENEFITS \n","Text":["\n   PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. _ Mental health care advocates long viewed\nSouth Florida State Psychiatric Hospital here as a dumping ground,\na place where patients were treated poorly, languished for years\nand died mysteriously.\n","\n   South Florida State, only a few years ago threatened with\nclosing as the way to solve its problems, is now at the heart of an\nexperiment.
