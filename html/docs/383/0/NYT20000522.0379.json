To raise\nawareness, and help those in need, Rosalynn Carter has for more\nthan a decade hosted the annual Georgia Mental Health Forum, where\n350 consumers and policy-makers gathered Monday in Atlanta to hear\nSurgeon General David Satcher talk via teleconference about a\nhistoric 500-page report he released in December on mental illness,\ncompiled from more than 3,000 studies. The report found that nearly\nhalf of all mentally ill Americans do not seek treatment and, in\nmany cases, face an enduring stigma, a lack of services and\ninequity in insurance coverage. As many as 825,000 Georgians sought\nmental health treatment last year. Carter took a break from the\nforum to talk with medical writer Diane Lore about the report's\nimpact on mental health policy and care.\n\n   Q: How would you assess the state of mental health care in this\ncountry. Are people getting the treatment they need?\n\n   A: I would say we would rank as ``poor'' ... or ``could do a lot\nbetter.'' At least half of the people who need treatment still\ndon't get it. And many of those who are critically ill are\nabsolutely not getting the care they need. We still have a cycle of\npeople getting hospitalized for a short while and then landing back\non the street. We really need a plan where they can go to a\ncommunity center where they can get the care they need.\n\n   Q: The confidentiality of mental health records has been a\nconcern for you _ how is that issue developing nationwide?\n\n   A: It's still pretty dismal. With managed care, we still have so\nmany people who can access records. We still have not made any\nprogress with a bill in Congress. And it's still a very important\nissue.\n\n   Q: What changes would you like to see in mental health?\n\n   A: The main, most important thing, at the national level is to\npass laws requiring parity in insurance. I think that would do the\ngreatest good in eliminating stigma. ... (a lot of people believe)\nif insurance covers (a condition), then it must be all right to\nhave. We've had 31 states pass parity laws, but often they are very\nnarrow in scope. Also, insurance often gets around true parity by\nimposing higher co-payments and fewer days for treatment.\n\n   Q: Are there things happening _ in Georgia or elsewhere _ that\nyou would hold up as models for diagnosis, treatment or prevention?\n\n   A: I believe Skyland Trail, a treatment facility here in\nAtlanta, is doing an excellent job, because its services are simply\nstate-of-the-art. I also think Community Friendship and Project\nInterconnections, which deals with the homeless mentally ill and\nare located here, are taking a good approach. The National Alliance\nfor the Mentally Ill is also supporting a program for the seriously\nmentally ill called Program for Assertive Community Treatment that\nis wonderful. It takes a holistic approach, which is really a good\nway to go. Depression and anxiety screening days also are helpful.\n\n   Q: What are the best changes to occur in the field of mental\nhealth in the past 10 to 15 years?\n\n   A: Scientific research and the development of the consumer\nmovement. Those two things have made a total difference in what's\nhappening.\n\n   Q: And what would you change in mental health if you could?\n\n   A: I would wipe out stigma. Stigma remains our greatest\nchallenge. There seems to be a little glimmer of hope, but we still\nhave a long way to go. Part of the reason is the misconception that\nmental health is the result of a weak will or a moral defect or bad\nparenting. Too often, families still believe that if (patients)\nwanted to, they could just snap out of it. That's part of the\nreason the surgeon general's report is so important _ it gives us a\nreal chance to have science back our case.\n\n   Q: What impact do you think the surgeon general's report will\nhave?\n\n   A: The report gives us the scientific basis we need to make a\ncase to policymakers. It will help us tell the public the true\nfacts (about mental illness) instead of the myth and\nmisconceptions. It also calls attention to mental illness on a\nnational level, promoting awareness and helping people do away with\nthe stigma.\n\n   For more information:\n\n   www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/home.html\n\n   www.mhselfhelp.org\n\n   www.nimh.nih.org\n\n   www.cartercenter.org/mentalhealth.html\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   In Georgia, more than 1.65 million residents struggle with\nmental illness, and one in eight have severe conditions.
