Times News Service   \n\n   Dr. Alan I. Leshner, the director of the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, is\nknown for his slide shows. Two or three times a week he gives a\nspeech _ to treatment counselors and prevention specialists,\nphysicians and policy-makers _ and almost all feature slides culled\nfrom the work of the 1,200 researchers supported by his institute.\n\n   The slides are of brain scans, and they usually come in pairs.\nThe ``before'' slides show the activity of a normal brain; the\n``after'' ones depict a brain that has had prolonged exposure to\ndrugs. Lacing his presentation with jokes and Yiddish expressions _\nas a youth, Leshner summered at a Catskills hotel owned by his\ngrandparents, and he has a bit of Alan King in him _ he tries to\ntranslate the science into plain English.\n\n   What the science shows, he says, is that the brain of an addict\nis fundamentally different from that of a nonaddict. Initially,\nwhen a person uses hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, the chemistry\nof the brain is not much affected, and the decision to take the\ndrugs remains voluntary. But at a certain point, he says, a\n``metaphorical switch in the brain'' gets thrown, and the\nindividual moves into a state of addiction characterized by\ncompulsive drug use. These brain changes, Leshner says, persist\nlong after addicts stop using drugs, which is why, he continues,\nrelapse is so common. Addiction, Leshner declares, should be\napproached more like other chronic illnesses, like diabetes and\nhypertension. Going further, he says that drugs so alter the brain\nthat addiction can be compared to mental disorders like Alzheimer's\ndisease and schizophrenia. It is, he says, a ``brain disease.''\n\n   In promoting this concept, Leshner has stepped forthrightly into\na debate that has smoldered for decades: Are drug addicts\nresponsible for their behavior? Should they be treated as sick\npeople in need of help, or as bad people in need of punishment?\nLeshner has come down squarely on the side of illness. And he is\nwinning many people over. Today the brain-disease model is widely\naccepted in the addiction field, and Barry R. McCaffrey, the White\nHouse drug adviser, routinely invokes it.\n\n   Others are not convinced. ``I reject the notion that addicts\nfall under the spell of drugs and become a zombie and so are not\nresponsible for anything they do,'' says Dr. Sally L. Satel, a\nsenior associate at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in\nWashington and a practicing psychiatrist at a methadone clinic. To\nher and other critics, the brain-disease model is a new orthodoxy\nbased less on science than on a desire to soften the stigma\nattached to addiction.\n\n   The idea that addiction is a disease is not new. In the 1960s\nAlcoholics Anonymous began speaking of alcoholism as a disease.\nBut, initially at least, AA used the term figuratively to suggest\nthe tenacious hold drinking has on alcoholics. Over the last decade\nor so, however, advances in brain-imaging technology have allowed\nresearchers to measure the impact of psychoactive substances on the\nbrain with increasing precision. Investigators have found that\ndrugs like cocaine, heroin and alcohol increase the brain's\nproduction of dopamine, the neurotransmitter that regulates\npleasure, among other things. This helps account for the euphoric\nhigh drug users feel. But these drugs deplete the dopamine pathway,\ndisrupting the individual's ability to function.\n\n   At the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, for\ninstance, Dr. Nora D. Volkow has found that even 100 days after a\ncocaine addict's last dose, there is significant disruption in the\nbrain's frontal cortical area, which governs such attributes as\nimpulse, motivation and drive. Volkow says that ``the disruption of\nthe dopamine pathways leads to a decrease in the reinforcing value\nof normal things, and this pushes the individual to take drugs to\ncompensate.''\n\n   Other researchers have found a physiological basis for the\ncraving so many addicts experience, but it is not yet clear how\nlong such physiological changes remain.\n\n   Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, the medical director of the National\nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York, says that the\nbrain-disease concept fits with his experience with thousands of\naddicts over the years. ``No one wants to be an addict,'' he says.\n``All anyone wants to be able to do is knock back a few drinks with\nthe guys on Friday or have a cigarette with coffee or take a toke\non a crack pipe. But very few addicts can do this. When someone\ngoes from being able to control their habit to mugging their\ngrandmother to get money for their next fix, that convinces me that\nsomething has changed in their brain.''\n\n   But does causing changes in the brain qualify addiction as a\nbrain disease? Not according to Dr. Gene M. Heyman, a lecturer at\nthe Harvard Medical School and a research psychologist at McLean\nHospital in Boston. ``Since we can visualize the brain of someone\nwho's craving, people say, `Ah hah, addiction is a brain\ndisease,''' he remarks. ``But when someone sees a McDonald's\nhamburger, things are going on in the brain, too, but that doesn't\ntell you whether their behavior is involuntary or not.''\n\n   While acknowledging that addiction does induce compulsive\nbehavior, Heyman says that addicts still retain a degree of\nvolition, as evidenced by the many who stop using drugs.\n\n   ``Smoking meets the criteria for addiction, but 50 percent of\nsmokers have quit,'' he says. This change, he goes on, is\n``demonstrably related'' to the data about the hazards of smoking\nthat have emerged since the surgeon general's report on the subject\nin 1964. By contrast, Heyman says, ``information about\nschizophrenia hasn't reduced the frequency of that illness.''\n\n   Heyman also cites a well-known study of Vietnam veterans who\nwere dependent on heroin while overseas. Within three years of\ntheir return to the United States, the study found, nearly 90\npercent were no longer using it _ strong evidence, Heyman says,\nthat the addictive state is not permanent.\n\n   Sally Satel first became skeptical about the brain-disease model\nin 1997, when she attended a conference of the drug-abuse institute\non the medical treatment of heroin addiction. ``So pervasive was\nthe idea that a dysfunctional brain is the root of addiction that I\nwas able to sit through the entire two-and-a-half-day meeting\nwithout once hearing such words as `responsibility,' 'choice,'\n'character' _ the vocabulary of personhood,'' Satel wrote in a\npaper called ``Is Drug Addiction a Brain Disease?''\n\n   Written with Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin and published as a booklet\nby the Ethics and Public Policy Center, the paper offers a\nblistering attack on the drug-abuse institute and its brain-disease\nterminology. ``Dramatic visuals are seductive and lend scientific\ncredibility to NIDA's position,'' the paper states, but politicians\n``should resist this medicalized portrait for at least two reasons.\n\n   First, it appears to reduce a complex human activity to a slice\nof damaged brain tissue. Second, and most important, it vastly\nunderplays the reality that much of addictive behavior is\nvoluntary.''\n\n   (MORE) nn\n\n   To support that claim, Satel cited the results of the\nEpidemiologic Catchment Area study, paid for by the National\nInstitute of Mental Health, which asked 20,300 adults about their\npsychological history. Of the 1,300 people who were found to have\nbeen dependent on or abusing drugs, 59 percent said they had not\nbeen users for at least a year before the interview; the average\ntime of remission was 2.7 years.\n\n   ``The fact that many, perhaps most addicts are in control of\ntheir actions and appetites for circumscribed periods of time shows\nthat they are not perpetually helpless victims of a chronic\ndisease,'' Satel said.\n\n   At the mention of Satel, Leshner bristles. ``Simplistic and\npolarizing,'' he says of her writing. More generally, Leshner\nmaintains that his views have been distorted and misinterpreted.\nStill, he says, he has lately modified his message, giving more\nrecognition to the role of volition in addiction.\n\n   ``Today's version,'' he says, is that addiction is ``a brain\ndisease expressed as compulsive behavior; both its development and\nthe recovery from it depend on the individual's behavior.''\n\n   Where does choice end and compulsion begin?
