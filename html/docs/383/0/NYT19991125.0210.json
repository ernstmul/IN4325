She has been on the street, on\ndrugs and, she acknowledges, not 100 percent in the head.

It would not\nsurprise him if the brick-wielder was trapped in the same mental\nlabyrinth. ``Maybe somebody did something to him, or a girl\ndisrespected him,'' Fonville said.

Eight of them got\ntogether the other day to talk about life on the street and the\nlong, uncertain road out of it.\n\n   They formed a quorum of misery, these troubled souls with their\ncriminal records, histories of violence, addictions to a laundry\nlist of drugs and assorted mental problems: bipolar disorder,\nvoices in the head, severe depression, you name it. They are, or\nwere, the kinds of people the rest of us step around when we see\nthem on the street, or pretend do not exist by burying our heads in\nthe newspaper when they stumble into the subway car.\n\n   ``I don't think people consider us normal,'' said Jeanine\nMatteo, 31. ``They look down on us. Nobody would ever reach out to\npeople like us to say, `Do you need help?'''\n\n   Her Phoenix House roommate gave only her first name, Kelly,\nbecause she did not want to embarrass her family on Long Island.\nKelly is 21. She has done a lot of living in those few years, not\nmuch of it good, certainly not the part when she was strung out and\nhomeless in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. She had come\nmentally unhinged.\n\n   ``Voices told me to rob people,'' Kelly said. ``I looked at\npeople not as people, just purses.''\n\n   ``We get looked at like we're bad people who do sick things,''\nshe said. ``But in treatment you realize that we're sick people who\ndo bad things.''\n\n   David Muse, 36, recalled how it used to be. ``I get these\noutbursts when I get so very emotional, my chest rises up, '' he\nsaid. ``But I've had proper medication for four or five months. It\nbalances me out.''\n\n   Kelly picked up on his point. ``If a person has diabetes, he has\na chemical imbalance, and you give him insulin,'' she said. ``But\nif a person's mentally ill or addicted to drugs, he's got a\nchemical imbalance, too. But they throw him in jail. What happens\nif you put a diabetic in jail without treatment? He dies. And what\nhappens to us? Well, we wither and die.''\n\n   Treatment, they all agreed, is the underplayed component in the\nGiuliani administration's latest roundup of street people, which to\nthem suggests not so much a thought-out policy as a knee-jerk\nreaction to lurid tabloid headlines after the assault on Ms.\nBarrett.\n\n   Even the mayor acknowledged last week that neither the city nor\nthe state has come up with enough money for programs needed by the\nmentally ill homeless. But the focus for now is on the area of\ngovernance he is most comfortable with: law enforcement.\n\n   That approach alone will lead to failure, predicted Joan Jones,\n49. ``There's more drugs in jail than on the street,'' she said.\n\n   Of course, Ms. Jones added, homeless people themselves have to\nwant to get a grip. Francisco Harkless, 29, said that he finally\ndecided to enter a treatment program early this year because ``I\ngot tired of getting high, and I knew it was time to give it up.''\n\n   Ms. Burgess simply ``got sick and tired of being sick and\ntired.''\n\n   ``I feel pretty lucky that I'm here to tell the story,'' she\nsaid. ``God must've been looking over me, because with the things\nthat I did, I should be dead.''\n","Headline":"\nNYC COLUMN: MENTALLY ILL AND ADRIFT ON STREETS \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Breathes the New Yorker whose thoughts and prayers\nare not with Nicole Barrett this holiday season?\n","\n   But let's be honest with ourselves.
