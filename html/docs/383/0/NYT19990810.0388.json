Even more troubling to some legislators, the board also\nslashed $7.2 million from current levels of community services for\nthe mentally ill.\n\n   ``This does have some fairly significant implications at the\ncommunity level in terms of services that may not be available,''\nsaid Dr. Steven Schnee, executive director of the Harris County\nMental Health Mental Retardation Authority.\n\n   The bottom line is that 1,700 psychotic individuals statewide\nsuffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression\nwould not get the new drugs as legislators had intended.\n\n   The cutbacks at Houston mental-health centers could weaken case\nmanagement, outpatient counseling, housing, employment services and\nother supports that help stabilize the mentally ill, said Spencer\nMcClure, executive director of the Texas Council of Community MHMR\nCenters Inc.\n\n   Nearly 19,000 mentally ill people receive services from the\nHarris County community center along with about 3,500 mentally\nretarded individuals, according to the state MHMR agency. Harris\nCounty includes most of Houston.\n\n   Exactly how many will be affected statewide and locally by cuts\nto the community centers is unclear, but estimates easily exceed\n2,000, considering the impact on the drug treatments alone.\n\n   ``It's adult mental-health services that are particularly being\nreduced,'' McClure said. ``Without these services and support they\n(the mentally ill) would end up either in the streets, the jails or\nback in the state institutions.''\n\n   Also among the scheduled cuts are $2.3 million in services for\nthose receiving the new drug therapies; a $2.4 million reduction in\nstate hospital beds, reducing the number by 60; and more than $4\nmillion in administrative spending and information technology\ncosts.\n\n   The problems would presumably be repeated in the fiscal year\n2001 as well, meaning that the total shortfall for the two-year\nfunding cycle could reach $60 million, officials said.\n\n   Key legislators, frustrated that the agency did not reveal the\nfunding problem last spring when lawmakers could have fixed it,\nasked the agency not to make any cuts while a solution is explored.\nMHMR Commissioner Karen Hale said plans for the cuts are in effect\nbut ``on pause'' for now.\n\n   ``I hope that it would change. I hope that the funding would go\nback into the community centers and in the new generations drugs\nand services,'' said Lynn Lasky, public policy director for the\nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Texas.\n\n   Lasky added that it is particularly ironic for the agency to cut\nfunding from the new drug program, which includes support services\nfor the patients receiving them, since it originally asked for more\nthan twice that.\n\n   ``They got about half of what they asked for, and now they're\nsaying we can do this for less,'' she said. ``When you come back to\nthe next session how do you knock on the door again and say we need\nmore money?''\n\n   Democratic Rep. Rob Junell of San Angelo, chairman of the House\nAppropriations Committee, said the audit will be key in\nunderstanding the funding problem _ when it developed, why it\nwasn't reported and what to do about it.\n\n   ``I don't know if it's money they are in the hole, money they\nhave to pay back for this fiscal year, bills they've got now,''\nJunell said. ``If they really went and spent money they're not\ngoing to have, we don't know it, and I'm not sure they know.''\n\n   Junell said he doubts Commissioner Hale knew the full extent of\nthe problem, which she now attributes to a smaller surplus in\nfederal funds to carry over from previous years and fewer federally\ninsured Medicaid and Medicare patients at state hospitals.\n\n   ``I hope it's because they didn't have a clue. That's better\nthan they intentionally withheld the information. You don't get $60\nmillion behind in just a few months,'' Junell said.\n\n   Hale said Tuesday that the agency became aware of the full\nextent of the shortfall by the session's end but simply failed to\ncommunicate the problem effectively to legislators. She and the\nagency's chief financial officer, Bill Campbell, who came on board\nin April, contend that legislators were aware the agency was\nexpecting $15 million less in surplus money from federal accounts.\n\n   Yet, Junell said, the current estimated shortfall for the next\ntwo years is four times that. He said committee members thought\nthat problem had been solved by allowing for an emergency\nappropriation if needed.\n\n   ``We did everything we could first to try to close the gap\nwithout affecting services,'' Campbell said. ``Then we got down to\nthe really hard decisions.''\n\n   He said cuts to the community centers represent a 3.2 percent\nreduction in services statewide, but plans to allow the centers\nflexibility in the use of their money might help.\n\n   Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, a legislative champion of the\nmentally ill, said the budget snafu is particularly troubling\nbecause the state of Texas has never come close to meeting the\ncritical needs of the mentally ill.\n\n   ``The reason I'm real concerned is we don't make a lot of\nprogress in this area,'' he said. ``When the Legislature has no\nconfidence in the agency, that hurts programs that the agency is\ncarrying out.''\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nSNAFUS AT TEXAS AGENCY THREATEN SERVICES FOR MENTALLY ILL \n\n","Text":["\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ A surprising $30 million shortfall in the coming\nyear's state mental-health budget threatens to slash services by\nSept. 1 for at least 2,000 mentally ill people statewide, officials\nsaid Tuesday.\n","\n   State auditors are probing the financial woes plaguing the Texas\nDepartment of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and might have\nanswers by Friday to avoid or minimize a cutback in services.\n","\n   Key legislators and agency officials began scrambling for\nsolutions this week after widespread protests followed the\nmental-health board's Friday vote to cut programs for the mentally\nill to make up for mistakes in budgetary planning.\n","\n   The board wants to cut $5 million from $27 million in new state\nspending for a ``new generation'' of more effective anti-psychotic\ndrugs.
