I pour the juice, clean the tables and, with a bit of\nluck, get to scramble the eggs or stir the oatmeal. I often wonder\nwhether it does much good. The place is not terribly efficient, and\nit has more volunteers than it can use. But, hey, I'm trying. It\neases the guilt when I pass a panhandler on the street.\n\n   Now, however, comes Janet Poppendieck, a sociology professor at\nHunter College, to say that I am part of the problem. As a\nvolunteer, I have unwittingly joined a nefarious plot to undermine\nand replace the government safety net with an inadequate private\nnetwork of food pantries and soup kitchens. ``The proliferation of\ncharity contributes to our society's failure to grapple in\nmeaningful ways with poverty,'' Poppendieck says in her book,\n``Sweet Charity?'' Soup kitchens have created a moral safety valve\nthat lets government off the hook for the nation's poor, writes\nPoppendieck, who sees a right-wing conspiracy that uses soup\nkitchens and food pantries to justify destroying the welfare\nsystem: ``In short, by engaging the contributions of millions of\ndonors and volunteers, emergency food has 'proven' the conservative\ncontention that voluntary sector programs are 'cheaper' than public\nsector efforts.'' Feeding programs meant by their organizers to\noffset the decline of public benefits are being used instead to\njustify further cuts.\n\n   This raises an important point that Congress, which overhauled\nthe welfare system in 1996, still has not addressed. House Speaker\nNewt Gingrich and other proponents of that reform hope the\nlegislation will spark a charitable revival, because nonprofit\norganizations, Gingrich says, get more done at less cost. That's\ntrue enough, but the nation's charities simply aren't big or strong\nenough to take on the role supporters of the welfare reform measure\nwant for them. The government, by some estimates, spends 10 times\nas much as charities spend on the poor, and charities get about a\nquarter of their own funds from the government. Churches and other\ncharities would need to double or even triple their budgets just to\noffset the cuts that are allowed under the welfare reform law. And\nAmericans, who give under 2 percent of their income to charity,\nclearly aren't going to pick up the slack on their own.\n\n   Unfortunately, Poppendieck sullies this timely argument by\npairing it with an unworkable solution. She wants the government to\nraise taxes, spend more money and rebuild a welfare state. And she\nwants charities to spend less time being charitable and more time\nlobbying the government to put them out of business. The act of\nfeeding the hungry, she says, ``could probably be accomplished far\nmore simply by raising the food stamp allotment, or the minimum\nwage.'' Volunteers, in essence, should drop their oatmeal ladles\nand call their representatives. ``Because food programs are\nlogistically demanding, their maintenance absorbs the attention and\nenergy of many of the people most concerned about the poor,\ndistracting them from the larger issues of distributional\npolitics,'' she writes. Her argument amounts to cursing the\ndarkness instead of lighting a candle -- or, more accurately,\nlobbying Congress about the darkness so the government can turn on\nthe lights.\n\n   We have been down this road before. Poppendieck, admirably,\nwants to ``unite and integrate people'' instead of ``separating and\nsegregating them.'' But the very government programs Poppendieck\nwishes to revive with vast new financing have proved powerless to\nstop increases in inequality. Worse, they have encouraged\ndependency and the sort of permanent, segregated underclass that\nshe rightfully deplores. Poppendieck herself notes that inequality\nhas grown to its worst in half a century -- this despite all the\ngovernment's poverty programs. The debate has moved from cash\nhandouts to jobs and ways to help the poor help themselves. But\nPoppendieck takes us through a time warp back to the rhetoric of\nthe 1980's.\n\n   She began her project seven years ago, and changing times have\nmade holes in her argument. We hear about how rampant unemployment\nspurs demand for emergency food. ``Our overall rate in the United\nStates averaged 4.6 percent in the 1968-73 period and 7.2 percent\nin the 1980-89 period,'' she writes. Fine, but this is 1998, and\nthe latest jobless figures are at 4.6 percent, yet demand for\nemergency food continues to soar. Indeed, Poppendieck barely\nmentions some of the most significant reasons people land in soup\nkitchens: mental illness and drug addiction.\n\n   ``Sweet Charity?'' is far more convincing as a sociological\nstudy than as a political action plan. Author of ``Breadlines Knee\nDeep in Wheat: Food Assistance in the Great Depression'' (1986),\nPoppendieck tells the interesting story of the rise of emergency\nfood distributed through food pantries as groceries and through\nsoup kitchens as meals. Their rise began in the early 1980's when\nthe federal government, sitting on vast surpluses of dairy\nproducts, began a cheese give-away, thus creating a need for the\npantries and kitchens to distribute the food. This became\ninstitutionalized in 1983 when Congress created the Temporary\nEmergency Food Assistance Program, which was not, as it turns out,\ntemporary. The increased supply fed the demand, and everyone --\ncorporations, politicians, celebrities -- had selfish motives to\ncontinue the program. Eventually, the program switched from being a\ntemporary surplus disposal program to a permanent food procurement\nprogram.\n\n   ``Sweet Charity?'' demonstrates, convincingly, that the growing\nemphasis on emergency food for the hungry is a Band-Aid that\ndistracts from the fundamental goal of solving poverty. But it does\nnot entertain the idea that charitable work is as much a part of\nthe solution as government intervention. Poppendieck rightly senses\nreluctance among charities and volunteers to turn themselves into\nlobbyists, as she proposes. ``Volunteers are often less\nenthusiastic about advocacy than about direct service,'' she\nwrites. ``Preparing a meal with a group of other people and serving\nit is fun; writing to your representative is work.''\n\n   Or maybe these volunteers believe that the government is not the\nonly answer. Indeed, many charities are working on substantive\nsolutions to poverty, though the notion gets scant mention in the\nbook. Many soup kitchens, including the one at which I volunteer,\noffer a whole range of rehabilitative services: job search\nprograms, job training, alcohol and drug treatment, care for the\nmentally ill, community organizing. Government, of course, must do\nits part. It cannot abandon its responsibility for the poor. But,\nrather than supplanting charities, government can --and should --\ndo more to strengthen them.\n\n   Some ideas have already been floated.
