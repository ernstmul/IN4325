(rk) \n By ROBYN MEREDITH   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   DETROIT _ In a controversial and unusual effort to move more\nwelfare recipients into the work force, Michigan plans a pilot\nprogram that would require thousands of those applying for aid to\ntake drug tests to qualify for benefits.\n\n   Starting in October, Michigan welfare applicants under 65 in\nthree locations yet to be chosen will be required to take drug\ntests or forfeit their benefits. People already receiving benefits\nat those locations would be randomly tested.\n\n   Those who test positive for illegal drugs would be required to\nget treatment to collect welfare money, and those who refuse\ntreatment would be dropped from the welfare rolls.\n\n   Against a tide of opposition from civil libertarians and welfare\nexperts and mixed reaction from welfare recipients themselves, Gov.\nJohn Engler explained that the program would help those who needed\ndrug treatment to get it and to obtain jobs.\n\n   ``The idea is that workplace testing today is so common,''\nEngler said. ``This is a tool that will help identify some of the\nproblems that need to be treated.''\n\n   Michigan was one of the early leaders nationwide in the effort\nto end the decadeslong system of guaranteed welfare benefits and to\nreplace it with time limits and other changes intended to force\nthose on welfare to work.\n\n   Since October 1992, when Michigan's welfare changes began, the\nstate's caseload has dropped about 60 percent, to 89,866 families\nfrom 225,359, the 14th largest drop among states, according to\nfederal statistics.\n\n   With many of those most able to find jobs already working,\nMichigan is trying a new approach on welfare. The mandatory drug\ntests, which other states have considered but rejected, are just\none indication of its new direction.\n\n   Other initiatives include a plan to reduce fraud by taking\ncomputerized fingerprint images of those applying for welfare. And\nthe welfare agency plans to expand its ``Project Zero'' program to\n25 additional welfare offices around the state, bringing to 60 the\nnumber of locations offering flexible, expanded social services,\nlike child care and transportation, with a goal of reducing welfare\ncases in a given area to zero.\n\n   But of all the initiatives, mandatory drug testing has raised\nthe most concern, especially among civil libertarians, social\nworkers and welfare experts.\n\n   Other states have considered similar drug testing programs but\nhave backed away.\n\n   Last year, Florida set up a pilot program in two regions to\ndetect drug-abusing welfare recipients. It asks drug-use questions\nof all applicants, but uses physical drug tests only on those it\nhas reasonable cause to believe use drugs.\n\n   Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for\nwelfare recipients and certain public employees. But after a task\nforce was set up to carry out the law, the state decided instead to\nrequire applicants to answer a questionnaire about drug use.\nAnswers to the questions determine whether a drug test is\nadministered.\n\n   New York and Maryland planned to require drug tests but found\nthat other types of screening like questionnaires were cheaper and\nmore effective. Four other states _ New Jersey, Minnesota, South\nCarolina and Wisconsin _ randomly test welfare recipients with\nfelony drug convictions.\n\n   The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is\nconsidering suing the state to challenge the program on\nconstitutional grounds, arguing that the mandatory drug test\nviolates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable\nsearch and seizure.\n\n   ``The state is starting from the assumption that the poor are\ncriminals,'' said Kary L. Moss, executive director of the ACLU of\nMichigan. ``The state is saying that if you want money for food and\nshelter you have to give up the Fourth Amendment rights that others\nhave.''\n\n   Social workers are concerned that the new program could have\nunintended consequences.\n\n   ``It is very demeaning,'' said Sharon Parks, senior research\nassociate at the Michigan League for Human Services, a nonprofit\norganization. ``It might have a real chilling effect on people even\ncoming in and applying.''\n\n   Welfare experts object to the program and say it has a number of\nshortcomings.\n\n   ``Michigan is the only state in the country that is doing\nthis,'' said Gwen Rubinstein, director of policy research at the\nLegal Action Center, a nonprofit organization based in New York\nthat focuses on alcohol and drug policy and tracks drug testing\nefforts nationwide. ``Drug testing often sounds on the surface like\na good idea, but it has so many flaws.''\n\n   First, Ms. Rubinstein said, drug testing will not turn up those\nwith alcohol abuse problems, which are more prevalent among welfare\nrecipients. The tests are intrusive, she said, and casual drug\nusers who are able to work will test positive along with addicts\nwho need treatment.\n\n   Because testing is also expensive, it can divert money that\ncould otherwise be used for drug treatment and other social\nservices, Ms. Rubinstein said.\n\n   Sheldon Danziger, an economist and professor of social work and\npublic policy at the University of Michigan who conducted a study\nof Michigan welfare recipients, said money used to test for drug\nuse could be put to better use screening for mental health problems\nthat needed treatment.\n\n   ``A much greater percentage of women have mental health problems\nlike depression, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress\ndisorder than have substance abuse problems,'' Danziger said.\n\n   But Douglas E. Howard, the new director of the state welfare\nagency, defended his plans.\n\n   ``Michigan's approach is very unique,'' Howard said. ``It is not\njust testing; it is testing followed by treatment.''\n\n   He said the falling welfare caseload in the state dictated a\nchange in direction.\n\n   ``We're in an economy now where job placement isn't as tough as\nit was 10 years ago,'' he said. ``The challenge is in job\nretention.''\n\n   The state plans to select the three pilot sites in June, with\none likely to be in Detroit, one in another large city and one in a\nrural area, Howard said. Drug treatment availability varies by\nregion, and the sites chosen will be those with adequate treatment\ncenters.\n\n   ``What we are trying to do is remove barriers to work,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   It is unclear how much the testing and treatment programs will\ncost because neither the sites nor the testing material _ urine,\nsweat or hair follicles _ have been decided on. Most drug tests\ncost about $40 a person, Howard said, but he was not sure how many\npeople would fall under the jurisdiction of the three locations.\n\n   Some welfare recipients here vehemently oppose his plans, and\nothers applaud them.\n\n   ``It definitely would be humiliating to me,'' said Barbara L.\nWhitfield, 61, who has been raising four grandchildren since her\ndaughter died nine years ago. ``They should find a better way to do\nthat, a more dignified way.''\n\n   Others supported the plan. ``I think it is a good idea,'' said\nTalonda D. Loggins, 25, a mother of three who works as a nurse's\nassistant when she can find good child care and collects welfare\nwhen she cannot.\n\n   ``Some recipients are not using their money the way it is\nsupposed to be used,'' Ms. Loggins said, adding that the testing\nwould reduce recipients' use of drugs.\n","Headline":"\nMICHIGAN ENCOUNTERING OPPOSITION TO PLAN TO TEST WELFARE APPLICANTS\nFOR DRUGS\n","Text":["\n   DETROIT _ In a controversial and unusual effort to move more\nwelfare recipients into the work force, Michigan plans a pilot\nprogram that would require thousands of those applying for aid to\ntake drug tests to qualify for benefits.\n","\n   Starting in October, Michigan welfare applicants under 65 in\nthree locations yet to be chosen will be required to take drug\ntests or forfeit their benefits.
