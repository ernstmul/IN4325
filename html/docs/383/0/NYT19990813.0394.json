(See also LA-SHOOTING) \n(bl) \n By TIMOTHY EGAN  \n \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   SEATTLE _ The Washington state mental health system got an\nextensive look at Buford O. Furrow Jr. in the months before he\nadmitted to opening fire in a Jewish community center and killing a\npostal worker in Los Angeles on Tuesday. What the experts saw was a\nman who twice slashed his arms so deeply they required stitches,\ndrank alcohol until he blacked out, and espoused a deep hatred for\nanyone who is not white.\n\n   Yet, despite lengthy evaluations at mental institutions here,\nand no shortage of resources, Furrow was never ordered to remain\nunder long-term state psychiatric care. Instead, after serving\nnearly six months in jail for trying to stab two workers at a\nprivate hospital near Seattle, he was released under parole\nsupervision and required to take medication to control psychotic\nimpulses.\n\n   Whether Furrow should have fallen under this state's standard\nfor involuntary commitment to a mental institution is a question\nnow shadowing the ground where the justice system meets psychiatry.\nFurrow was an avowed racist who told a court last year that he\nfantasized about committing a mass killing. His temper and violent\nthreats were so grave that the officer who arrested him for assault\nin the Seattle area last year said he nearly had to shoot Furrow in\nself-defense.\n\n   Furrow's attorney in the case had said he would plead not guilty\nby reason of insanity. But Furrow pleaded guilty, court records\nshow, avoiding what could have been a lengthy confinement in a\nmental facility.\n\n   And while mental health experts here say Furrow did not slip\nthrough the cracks of a strained system _ as has happened with\ntroubled people in other states _ they say his case is the latest\nhigh profile crime to raise questions about whether states should\ntighten the laws on holding violent, mentally ill people in\nconfinement.\n\n   ``What does society do with these people?'' said Dr. Renee\nBinder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California\nat San Francisco and the chairwoman of the American Psychiatric\nAssociation's Council on Psychiatry and the Law. ``Most people\nwould say that being a racist with violent fantasies is not against\nthe law. Racism is not something that is designated as an illness\nthat can be treated by mental health professionals.''\n\n   New York officials recently agreed to expand state authority to\nforce mentally ill patients to undergo treatment or face\ninvoluntary commitment, joining nearly 40 states, including\nWashington, that have enacted similar laws.\n\n   In Furrow's home state of Washington, the debate is over whether\nhe met the requirements of someone who should have been held in a\nmental facility instead of serving a few months in jail for\nassault. The Washington state law, similar to the standard of most\nstates, says the person must have a mental disorder and pose a\nthreat to harm himself or others, in the eyes of professional\nexaminers.\n\n   Last year Furrow slashed his hands up with a knife and told\npolice he wanted to shoot people at random in a mall. Those\nstatements, alone, along with his threats to stab two women at a\nmental hospital, where he was trying to be admitted, should have\nbeen enough to bring a civil commitment case against Furrow, some\nexperts say.\n\n   ``This person went to a psychiatric hospital to ask for help,\npulled a knife on two women, stated very clearly that he was\nhomicidal and suicidal, and is tied into a Nazi hate group,'' said\nSherry Storm, the mental health ombudsman for King County, which\ncovers the Seattle area court system. ``All of those things put\ntogether would seem to make a pretty strong case that he poses a\nthreat to himself or others.''\n\n   But other officials say Furrow was simply a violent, hateful\nman, and that trying to blame the shootings on the failures of the\nmental health system is futile. They note that Furrow had only one\nrun-in with the law, that he had a college degree in engineering,\nand that he held numerous jobs, including employment at Boeing Co.\n\n   ``The problem I have is that people are trying to build a case\nthat this killing was done because the man was insane,'' said King\nCounty Executive Ron Sims. ``What he did was cowardly, repulsive\nand a very irrational act. But mental illness was not the cause.\nHatred was. This guy came out of a culture of hatred.''\n\n   National groups representing the mental health profession are\nalso reluctant to tie the shootings to a failure in the system.\nThey cite the case of Andrew Goldstein, the schizophrenic man who\npushed a woman to death in New York, or Russell Weston Jr., who\nkilled two people in the U.S. Capitol, as examples of how\npotentially violent, mentally ill people who sought treatment were\nlargely ignored. But with Furrow, they say, the case is less\ncompelling.\n\n   ``We all understand that Goldstein and Weston should have had\nmore treatment,'' said Bill Emmett, deputy executive director of\nthe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group based\nin Arlington, Va. ``But we're not that eager to have Furrow's case\nequated with Goldstein and Weston.
