But the treatment provision was quietly\nput to work more than two years ago, and early results show that\nthree-fourths of the people who complete treatment test clean for\ndrugs afterward.\n\n   Proposition 200's requirement that offenders get treatment\ninstead of prison infuriated Rick Romley, the prosecutor of\nMaricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, because he believes\nthat the threat of punishment is essential.\n\n   Under a county treatment program called ``Do Drugs, Do Time,''\ndrug users are threatened with jail if they do not agree to accept\ntreatment. Using this coercive approach, the program has been very\nsuccessful, said officials at the prosecutor's office, with a\nrecidivism rate of less than 10 percent.\n\n   ``We believe strongly in treatment,'' said Barnett Lotstein, a\nspecial assistant to the Maricopa County prosecutor. ``We're not\n`lock 'em up and throw away the key' people. But you have to have\nsomething to hold over people, a hammer if you will.''\n\n   Asked about the view of experts in the 1980s that crack\naddiction was untreatable, Norman Helber, Maricopa County's chief\nadult probation officer, said, ``We seem to have an awful lot of\nex-crack addicts in Arizona who could tell you otherwise.''\n\n   THE EARLY FIGHT: Combining `War' And Prevention\n\n   Richard Nixon was the first president to declare a ``war on\ndrugs,'' but he also directed about two-thirds of all federal\nanti-drug money at treatment and prevention _ particularly of\nheroin addiction _ with great success, as measured by sharp drops\nin crimes committed by drug addicts. His policy, led by a young\npsychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Jaffe, expanded federally financed\ntreatment facilities from 6 in 1969 to more than 300 in 1973.\n\n   ``What worked for Jerome Jaffe a quarter-century ago could be\njust as effective today,'' wrote Michael Massing, in his narrative\nhistory of drug policy, ``The Fix'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998)\n\n   Discouraged by news accounts of addicts who had skipped out of\ntreatment, New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller became one of the first\nmajor politicians to turn against treatment. ``Let's be frank,'' he\nsaid in a 1973 speech. ``We have found no cure.''\n\n   Rockefeller created some of the nation's most punitive drug\nlaws, which locked people up for 15 years for possessing certain\ndrugs.\n\n   For the next 20 years, the dominant sentiment among politicians\nand prosecutors was that ``nothing works,'' and treatment fell out\nof favor _ particularly in the crack years.\n\n   THE TREATMENT: Trying to Rebuild Wrecked Lives\n\n   Ever since his mother handed him a marijuana joint laced with\nopium at the age of 10, said Leslie Angle, he has had a\ncompanionship with illegal drugs. He is 39 now, gray haired, with a\nbit of a slouch.\n\n   ``Crack is the one drug that made me see that I needed help,''\nhe said. ``I hit my bottom with that drug.'' He was homeless,\nstealing to stay high, selling stolen property. He has been in and\nout of jail a half-dozen times for a variety of petty crimes, all\nof them tied to his drug addiction.\n\n   Angle entered the Proposition 200 treatment program in Arizona\nearly last year and pays about $40 a week, using money from Social\nSecurity disability payments for mental illness. Like others in\ntreatment, he attends about two sessions of group therapy a week,\nled by a licensed counselor.\n\n   There is no acupuncture. No synthetic substitutes such as\nmethadone. No shock therapy or drugs designed to mute the brain's\npleasure impulses. The treatment is aimed at getting Angle to\nrecognize the patterns of abuses in his life.\n\n   ``This teaches me things I didn't know before,'' Angle said.\n``I'm tired of just stumbling along through life _ sick of\neverything I became. This program has taught me that I have a\nchoice: that I can change.''\n\n   In New York, Phoenix House admits about 1,000 people every year\nto a residential treatment program. Many of them might otherwise go\nto prison under the state's Rockefeller drug laws. The laws give\njudges no choice but to sentence offenders to jail, but prosecutors\noften decide not to press charges if an offenders agrees to stay in\na program like Phoenix House.\n\n   New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, has suggested that\nhis state's harsh anti-drug laws could be amended to give judges\ndiscretion to send some first-time offenders to treatment instead\nof jail. Critics say his proposal is too modest, but Democrats,\nconcerned they would be labeled soft on drug crime if they agreed\nto the changes, have refused to act upon it.\n\n   A majority of the people who enter Phoenix House identify crack\nas their primary drug. Treatment involves extensive group therapy\nfor 12 to 18 months, paid for by state and federal grants, or\ndonations. For people who are used to instant gratification,\nPhoenix House is a long, slow process _ a prospect that makes many\naddicts balk at entering on their own.\n\n   But the program's results defy the predictions that crack\naddicts would prove untreatable. About 70 percent of those who\ncomplete at least a year of the program have tested drug-free up to\nfive years after departing, said Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the\npresident of Phoenix House.\n\n   ``Crack and me were like best friends,'' said Danny Servera, a\n31-year-old New Yorker who has been in treatment for eight months.\nHe is a natty dresser who used to manage a men's clothing store.\nThis is his second time in treatment for crack.\n\n   ``I never woke up in the morning with the shakes or anything\nlike that,'' Servera said. ``For me, it was always mental. I'd\nstart to think about getting high as a way to numb myself.''\n\n   Treatment is built around the person, not the drug. It involves\nrebuilding a life, in contrast to prison, where the concept of\nrehabilitation has been all but abandoned.\n\n   ``There's a growing number of us who never walked away from the\nbelief that the key to bringing down drug use is trying to change\nbehavior,'' said Barbara Broderick, who administers the drug\ntreatment fund for the state of Arizona. ``Prison should be for\nviolent people and the recalcitrant.''\n\n   Prison is where most hard-core drug users who have run afoul of\nthe law now reside. More than 90 percent of them have had no\ntreatment for the addictions that got them in prison, where drugs\noften remain freely available.\n\n   Locking up these people, in the view of some criminologists, is\na main reason why crime is down. But as many of the nation's\n400,000 imprisoned drug offenders are released in the coming years,\nthey are likely to follow a pattern that has already taken hold:\nthe ones who have not been treated _ the great majority _ will\ncommit another crime within five years.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   The part of the law that allowed doctors to prescribe major\ndrugs has been effectively halted by federal restrictions on the\nmedical use of such drugs.
