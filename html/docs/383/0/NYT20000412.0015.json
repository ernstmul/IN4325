Times News Service clients)  \n BY WILLIAM HERMANN  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   On one side rises the shiny new cityscape of downtown Phoenix's\nrebirth.\n\n   On the other looms the lustrous copper dome of the Arizona State\nCapitol.\n\n   In between _ squeezed ever smaller _ squats a dirty little\ncorner of hell.\n\n   An increasingly compressed mixture of mentally ill homeless and\ncriminal predators has turned the area between Seventh and 15th\navenues, Harrison to Jefferson streets into a ghetto of misery and\nviolence, city officials and homeless advocates say.\n\n   The situation is so bad that Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt\nhas urged the city to rectify ``years of neglect'' that have\nallowed the area to slide into ``unchallenged disorder.''\n\n   In a memo written last week, Hurtt recommended that his officers\nstep up their presence in the area to protect the homeless and\narrest those preying upon them.\n\n   He and others say the crisis _ brewing for decades _ represents\nthe grim downside of Phoenix's celebrated renaissance.\n\n   ``We do have a crisis in that area, but it's coming should be no\nsurprise,'' said Louisa Stark of the non-profit Community Housing\nPartnership. ``Not so long ago, a lot of mentally ill people were\nliving in old hotels in the downtown,'' she said. ``Then we tore\nthem down for revitalization. The result was people lost their\nhousing and were pushed into the area where they are now.''\n\n   An area that's evolved from merely seedy to downright dangerous.\n\n   ``The criminal element within the homeless population has taken\nover the area, (which has) become a drug marketplace with high\ncriminal activity and neighborhood blight,'' Hurtt wrote in a\ncouncil report. ``Users from all over the city come to this area to\nbuy and sell illegal drugs.''\n\n   Larry Negrete heartily agrees.\n\n   ``It's real dangerous down here now, worse than before, since\neverybody is all cracked-out,'' said Negrete, who with friend,\nArthur Magana, live there and collect cans and discarded clothing\nin the neighborhoods.\n\n   ``Lots of mean, mean drug dealers, and the crazy people getting\nripped off and beat up and their disability money stolen from\nthem,'' he said. ``Bad. Bad.''\n\n   About 400 people call the Central Area Shelter Services building\nat 12th Avenue and Madison Street home. Another estimated 450 sleep\nin nearby vacant lots and streets.   \n_Changing nature of population More than half of them suffer from\nmental problems, estimates CASS Director Mark Halloran.\n\n   ``There are lots of jobs out there now, and most of the homeless\nwho had the capacity to work are working,'' he said.\n\n   ``What's left are some very seriously ill people. And we have\nabout 900 of them right here.''\n\n   The St. Vincent de Paul Society serves a hot lunch to hundreds\nof homeless people a block from CASS. Spokesman John Feit agreed\nthat ``well over half, maybe 70 percent of these folks, have mental\nhealth problems.\n\n   ``Many can't fend for themselves,'' Feit said. ``Most are in\npitiful shape. Hundreds need help and few are getting it.''\n\n   Many of the area's homeless are people who were _ or would have\nbeen _ treated in hospitals or other residential settings, Halloran\nsaid. But court decisions and state laws have forced the nation's\nmental hospitals to discharge many patients and admit far fewer\nthan in the past.\n\n   The CASS shelter, and the area around it, ``is being used as an\narea to contain the mentally ill,'' Halloran said. ``The state\ndoesn't have the money, they say, to help these people.''\n\n   In January, lawmakers and Gov. Jane Hull agreed to fund a new\nmental hospital at 24th and Roosevelt streets. On the other hand,\nstate Sen. Sue Grace, R-north Phoenix, introduced a bill to\nincrease mental health spending by $33 million, but the bill is\nstalled in the House.   \n_Signs of progress? The shuffling of the indigent west of Central\nAvenue began in the 1970s, when the old downtown ``Deuce'' area was\ndemolished and replaced by Phoenix Civic Plaza and Patriots Square.\nWith the Deuce went the many old hotels where the poor could stay\nfor as little as $1.50 a night.\n\n   As downtown redevelopment progressed, the homeless have been\npushed westward from the downtown core and into a smaller and\nsmaller area. With the coming completion of Phoenix City Court at\nFifth Avenue, and the new federal court building at Sixth Avenue,\nSeventh Avenue has become the line between downtown on the east and\nthe homeless area on the west.\n\n   The State Capitol at 17th Avenue and government buildings that\nextend to 15th Avenue mark the western boundary for the homeless, a\nboundary bolstered by residential redevelopment.\n\n   Hurtt said special training will be given to officers who soon\nwill conduct stepped-up patrols in the area. Drug dealers and\nmuggers will be targeted, he said. But the mentally ill ``will be\nanother story.''\n\n   ``With so many mentally ill people to deal with, arrests can't\nbe the only answer,'' Hurtt said.\n\n   Commander Emmett Quill of the South Mountain Precinct said\npsychiatrist Glenn Lippman will train officers to assess people\nwith behavioral health problems. Quill said plans now call for\nspace being made available in a state mental health facility for\npeople involved in incidents in the area who also seem to be\nsuffering from mental problems.\n\n   People who live and work in the area say they applaud police\nefforts, but doubt anything short of drastic action will solve the\nproblems.\n\n   Tammy Bosse, president of the Capitol Mall Association, a\nnon-profit group revitalizing that area, agreed: ``There are\nhundreds of hard-core mentally ill people in those few blocks,''\nshe said. ``Until they are dealt with, the problem won't be\nsolved.''\n\n   Hurtt expressed no illusions that his officers alone could solve\nit. ``When we are judged in the future on how we took care of the\nweak and helpless among us,'' he said, ``I'm afraid that judgment\nwill be a harsh one.''  \n","Headline":"\nPHOENIX BOOM LEFT INDIGENT IN ITS DUST \n","Text":["\n   On one side rises the shiny new cityscape of downtown Phoenix's\nrebirth.\n","\n   On the other looms the lustrous copper dome of the Arizona State\nCapitol.\n","\n   In between _ squeezed ever smaller _ squats a dirty little\ncorner of hell.\n","\n   An increasingly compressed mixture of mentally ill homeless and\ncriminal predators has turned the area between Seventh and 15th\navenues, Harrison to Jefferson streets into a ghetto of misery and\nviolence, city officials and homeless advocates say.\n","\n   The situation is so bad that Phoenix Police Chief Harold Hurtt\nhas urged the city to rectify ``years of neglect'' that have\nallowed the area to slide into ``unchallenged disorder.''\n","\n   In a memo written last week, Hurtt recommended that his officers\nstep up their presence in the area to protect the homeless and\narrest those preying upon them.\n","\n   He and others say the crisis _ brewing for decades _ represents\nthe grim downside of Phoenix's celebrated renaissance.\n","\n   ``We do have a crisis in that area, but it's coming should be no\nsurprise,'' said Louisa Stark of the non-profit Community Housing\nPartnership. ``Not so long ago, a lot of mentally ill people were\nliving in old hotels in the downtown,'' she said. ``Then we tore\nthem down for revitalization.
