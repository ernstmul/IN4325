Hinckley Jr., found not guilty by\nreason of insanity for his 1981 attempt to assassinate the\npresident, has gotten well, his psychiatrists say.\n\n   Hinckley's psychotic illnesses are in remission, according to\nhis doctors at St. Elizabeths Hospital here, where Hinckley was\ncommitted a year after shooting Reagan, James Brady, his press\nsecretary, a Secret Service agent, and a policeman outside the\nWashington Hilton Hotel. Doctors believe the depressed, delusional\nyoung man who said he wanted to impress actress Jodie Foster is now\na 44-year-old adult healthy enough to embark on supervised outings.\n\n   Hinckley has not taken pyschotropic medications since 1992. He\nlives on a low-security ward and holds a part-time clerical job at\nthe hospital. His supportive parents live nearby, and his fiancee\nLeslie deVeau, herself a former St. Elizabeths patient, revealed in\na recent New Yorker interview that the once-violent Hinckley now\nwrites love songs and tenderly calls her ``the sunshine of my\nlife.''\n\n   But others less connected to Hinckley are skeptical about the\ndoctors' diagnosis and note that Hinckley has a long history of\ndeceiving the staff at St. Elizabeths. And they are alarmed that a\nman who almost killed the president and paralyzed his press\nsecretary now is deemed not dangerous and might someday walk free\nin the very city where he caused such mayhem.\n\n   ``This is a no-brainer. This is a man who tried to kill the\npresident!'' said Joseph diGenova, a former US attorney who\nstrenuously objects to a recent federal appeals court ruling that\ngives Hinckley's doctors, not a judge, the authority to release him\nfor supervised visits.\n\n   ``I don't trust anyone who is directing a therapeutic regime to\nmake a sound public-policy decision,'' diGenova said. ``Hinckley's\ngoing out into the community should not be up to a group of doctors\nwho desire to see him cured and want to prove it to the world.''\n\n   Families of his victims refused to comment about Hinckley for\nthis story. But on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' earlier this\nyear, Maureen Reagan said she was ``irate'' at the idea Hinckley\nwould leave St. Elizabeths, and she blamed the decision on liberal\njudges who did not like her father.\n\n   Barry Levine, Hinckley's lawyer, says the case is about\nrehabilitation, not retribution. ``This man is not a prisoner, he's\na patient,'' said Levine, who suggests the visits are a ``precursor\nto larger liberties'' for Hinckley. ``He is entitled to treatment.\nThe next step is this very modest reintroduction into the\ncommunity.''\n\n   Clinically, that's right. Psychiatrists universally agree that\npeople recovering from mental illness need to ease back into\nsociety. As part of their therapy, patients at St. Elizabeths, the\nnation's largest public psychiatric hospital, routinely leave the\ngrounds for staff-supervised social outings, shopping trips, and\nholiday visits.\n\n   Often, these outings lead to greater freedom and eventually\nrelease from the institution. In nearby Maryland, for instance, the\naverage hospital stay for a mentally ill patient who commits murder\nis seven years.\n\n   But in this notorious patient's case, clinical decisions have\nbeen weighed against negative public opinion and concerns for\nHinckley's own safety outside the hospital. Hinckley's extremely\nrestricted life _ he has been allowed to leave the hospital only\nonce in 17 years, for a 12-hour visit with his parents in December,\n1986 _ and the strenuous opposition to his quest for freedom by the\nUS attorney's office here, and the Secret Service, have more to do\nwith his terrible act than with the severity of his schizophrenia\nor the risk he will become violent again.\n\n   Dr. Neil Blumberg, a Baltimore forensic psychiatrist, said the\nmajority of people who commit violent acts but are found not guilty\nby reason of insanity do get better with drugs and treatment, are\neventually discharged from maximum-security hospitals, and live\nindependently as law-abiding citizens.\n\n   Blumberg said Leslie deVeau, who he has evaluated extensively,\nis a ``poster child'' for rehabilitation from mental illness. In\n1982, deVeau took a shotgun and murdered her 10-year-old daughter\nin her bed. Ruled insane and committed to St. Elizabeths, DeVeau\nmade such extraordinary progress that in 1985 she was awarded\npermanent outpatient status and five years later a judge declared\nher legally sane. She says her friendship with Hinckley, which was\nborn and grew in the hospital, was therapeutic for both of them.\n\n   Indeed, in arguing for supervised, off-site visits in 1997,\nHinckley's doctors reported positive, ``profound changes'' in their\npatient. He was showing no symptoms of depression or schizophrenia,\nthey said, and the narcissistic personality disorder that drove his\npathological need to get attention had not disappeared but was much\nreduced.\n\n   In about one-third of all cases, schizophrenia can be ``cured.''\nBut, without medication and ongoing therapy, patients remain\nvulnerable to the illness recurring, said Dr. Harold J. Bursztajn,\nco-director of Harvard Medical School's Program in Psychiatry and\nthe Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. ``To send\nsomeone out without those things is like asking them to navigate\nand fly a plane without instruments,'' Bursztajn said.\n\n   Hinckley's lawyer has accused the US attorney of\n``fearmongering'' in describing his client as disturbed, dangerous,\nand unpredictable. In fact, one major risk factor for violence\namong people who are mentally ill is a history of violence. Because\nof Hinckley's record, it would be ``unfair to the people in this\ncommmunity and unfair to Jodie Foster, to release him unless he is\non medication,'' said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a research psychiatrist\nand an authority on schizophrenia.\n\n   Torrey, who has been involved in the Hinckley case, says\nHinckley suffers from a ``fixed delusional system'' that over time\nhas made it quite difficult for St. Elizabeths psychiatrists to\nevaluate him accurately. In the late 1980s, they petitioned the\ncourt to allow him day trips, only to discover that Hinckley had\ncorresponded with murderer Ted Bundy, referred to Charles Manson as\na ``cool dude,'' and still collected photos and drawings of Foster.\n\n   But Dr. Blumberg, who has never examined Hinckley but has had\nconversations about his condition with deVeau, said it is very\nunlikely that after 17 years of uninterrupted observation and\ntreatment, St. Elizabeths professional staff is going to\nmisdiagnose their patient.\n\n   ``Because this is such a high-profile case, no one wants to have\negg on his face by saying Hinckley is ready to go, and then have a\ndisaster happen,'' Dr. Blumberg said.\n\n   The US Justice Department last month let the deadline pass for\ntaking the Hinckley case to the Supreme Court, in essence giving up\nthe fight to bar supervised visits. However, for Hinckley's safety\nand privacy, the hospital refuses to say whether or when its\npatient has left the grounds. It will, however, inform the Secret\nService of Hinckley's outings.\n\n   ``This will be a very controlled and progressive and carefully\nanalyzed thing,'' said Walter Smith, special deputy for the\nDistrict of Columbia's corporation counsel, which represents St.\nElizabeths in court. ``I don't contemplate you will be running into\nJohn Hinckley at the grocery store one day and at the bowling alley\nthe next day.''\n\n   Representative James Traficant, Jr., an Ohio Democrat, thinks\nthat is only a matter of time. ``What is next, Mr. Speaker?''\nTraficant said in a recent speech on the House floor. ``White House\ntours?
