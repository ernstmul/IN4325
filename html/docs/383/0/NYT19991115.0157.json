Times News Service   \n\n   If there was a defining moment, a single event that foretold the\nsadness to come, Eric Godek's parents do not mention it. Looking\nback, they say only that he was 4 months old when they began to\nnotice things that worried them. He seemed to have lost the ability\nto lift his head and reach for his toys, and he had begun to choke\non feedings.\n\n   At first, their pediatrician in Peoria reassured them that Eric,\na bright, lively baby with huge brown eyes, seemed healthy. Jessica\nand David Godek, new parents in their 20s, were eager to believe\nhim.\n\n   ``But I think in my heart I knew something was wrong,'' Mrs.\nGodek said.\n\n   On Aug. 10, just after Eric turned 5 months old, the Godeks\nlearned that he was suffering from a rare muscle disorder, Pompe\ndisease, and that he had just two or three months left to live.\n\n   Desperate to save him, they found one speck of hope: researchers\nat Duke University Medical Center, in Durham, N.C., were testing a\nhighly promising experimental treatment in which infants like Eric\nwere given an essential enzyme that they lacked. The Godeks\ncontacted the university, and were encouraged to send Eric's\nmedical records. He had exactly the form of the disease being\nstudied.\n\n   But soon after the hope was offered, it was taken away. They\nwere told that although the research team wanted to treat their\nson, it would not be possible, because the study was designed to\ninclude only three babies, and the company sponsoring the research,\nSynpac Inc., of the nearby Research Triangle Park had provided\nenough medicine for only three. There was not enough for a fourth\nbaby, even though the first three had been promised a lifetime\nsupply if the drug worked. And Eric Godek would have been the\nfourth.\n\n   Pompe (pronounced pom-PAY) disease is an ``orphan'' disease, one\nof about 5,000 disorders so uncommon that drug companies used to\nignore them, assuming there would be too few customers to make it\npay to develop treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or\nfatal, and in 1983, hoping to encourage research, the government\nbegan offering tax credits, research grants and other incentives to\ncompanies working to treat rare diseases.\n\n   The incentives, provided under the Orphan Drug Act, worked. In\nthe decade before it was passed, fewer than 10 orphan drugs came to\nmarket. But since the act, 193 have been approved, nearly half of\nthem in the last five years. In large part because of the\ngovernment incentives, several so-called orphan drugs now make\ntheir manufacturers more than $1 billion a year.\n\n   ``The act has been one of the most successful laws ever passed\nby Congress,'' said Dr. Marlene Haffner, director of the office of\norphan products development at the Food and Drug Administration.\n``It's just been gangbusters.''\n\n   But in the tide of investment capital, start-up companies, new\ndrug applications, competition for marketing rights and\nconfidential business deals, it is possible for a child to be lost.\nCompanies competing to be first to market an orphan drug need to\nmove quickly, and they have no more incentive than any other drug\ncompany to spend the time or money to enlarge a study.\n\n   And Mrs. Godek found that a drug development strategy meant to\nbenefit patients like their son had no provision to help him in a\ncrisis. It rewarded manufacturers for creating new drugs, but not\nfor making experimental treatments available to sick people with no\nother options.\n\n   Eric Godek died on Sept. 28, and his parents were left with\npiercing questions about whether his death might have been avoided.\n\n   About 20 million Americans have orphan diseases: rare disorders,\neach one affecting fewer than 200,000 people. They include familiar\nillnesses like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, but also\nmany others like Pompe disease that few have heard of.\n\n   Most of the work on orphan drugs is done by small- to\nmedium-sized biotechnology companies created to develop new\nproducts. Some have been started by researchers who struck out on\ntheir own, backed by investors, to commercialize discoveries made\nin university laboratories.\n\n   Under the Orphan Drug Act, these companies can get waivers of\nFDA filing fees, worth $300,000 per drug, in addition to grants and\ntax credits. Especially important, a company that is first to\nreceive FDA approval for a particular orphan drug also gets\nexclusive marketing rights to it for seven years.\n\n   Companies then set their own prices; even though money from\ntaxpayers may have supported the development of an orphan drug, the\nFDA does not regulate the pricing of the final products.\n\n   Many orphan drugs cannot be patented, Dr. Haffner said, either\nbecause they are natural substances or because they are old\nproducts whose original patents have run out by the time a new use\nis found for them. ``That's why exclusivity has been so\nimportant,'' she said. ``It is stronger than a patent, because FDA\nwill monitor it.'' In the case of new drugs that can be patented,\nthe exclusive rights can come into effect before a patent does.\n\n   Abbey Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare\nDisorders, in New Fairfield, Conn., said, ``The biotechnology\nindustry was built on the Orphan Drug Act. These companies realize\nthat if they make drugs for diabetes and high blood pressure, they\ncan take a tiny piece of a big market with a lot of competition.\nBut if they go into a rare disease, there's no competition. They\ncan charge anything they want.''\n\n   As a result, orphan drugs are among the biotechnology industry's\nbiggest moneymakers. One, a replacement enzyme, like the treatment\nbeing studied for Pompe disease, costs $170,000 to $340,000 a year.\n\n   Pompe disease, also known as acid maltase deficiency, is caused\nby a deficiency in an enzyme called acid alpha glucosidase.\nNormally, the enzyme helps the body break down glycogen, a complex\ncarbohydrate that is converted to glucose for energy. Without the\nenzyme, glycogen builds up in the heart and other muscles, causing\nextensive damage.\n\n   The disorder is caused by a genetic defect inherited from both\nparents, and most, like the Godeks, have no idea that they are\ncarriers of a lethal gene until they give birth to a seriously ill\nchild.\n\n   nn\n\n   There are several forms of Pompe disease, varying in severity,\nand researchers estimate that there are 3,000 to 6,000 cases at any\ngiven time in the United States. The type that Eric Godek had is\nrapidly fatal, because it damages the heart and the muscles needed\nfor breathing. But the brain is spared, and babies remain as bright\nand aware as ever while they weaken and become immobile.\n\n   In May, Duke University Medical Center announced that it would\nbegin a clinical trial to test an experimental treatment in three\nbabies with the most severe form of Pompe disease. The treatment,\ninjections of the missing enzyme, had been developed by Dr.\nYuan-Tsong Chen, a professor of pediatrics and genetics and chief\nof medical genetics. Babies in the study would live at the hospital\nwith a parent for three months.\n\n   The trial was paid for by Synpac Inc., the drug development\ncompany in Research Triangle Park, with a parent company in Britain\nand owners in Taiwan. The university had licensed Chen's technology\nto Synpac. A spokesman for Synpac said it had invested millions in\nthe research, and had contracted the actual manufacturing to still\nanother company, which the spokesman declined to name.\n\n   Duke and Synpac have competition: a Dutch company, Pharming\nGroup NV, is also testing a replacement enzyme in Holland, and\nhoping for FDA approval. Its partner in the research is Genzyme, of\nCambridge, Mass.\n\n   Much is at stake: whichever company can be the first to prove\nits treatment works and get FDA approval will also win the seven\nyears of exclusive marketing rights.\n\n   The Godeks knew there was no guarantee that the treatment would\nwork. But they also knew that the first infant in the Duke study\nwas still alive, past the time when the disease would normally have\ntaken his life. To them, the study was Eric's only chance. Two\nbabies had already been chosen, but they were told that Eric might\nqualify for the third spot. Another child, though, was also being\nevaluated.\n\n   They were devastated to learn that Eric would not be part of the\nstudy after all. The other baby had qualified first. Even though\nEric had the rapidly fatal form of Pompe disease being studied,\neven though he was the only additional qualified applicant, the\nGodeks were told that there was not enough medicine, or enough\nstaff to take care of him.\n\n   To the Godeks, that defied logic. If enough enzyme could be made\nto treat three children for life, how could it not be possible to\nmake enough to keep a fourth alive?\n\n   ``I think they're in competition to get the patent and they\ndon't want to let anything slow them down,'' Mrs. Godek said,\nshortly before her son died. ``The drug company and the investors\nare making a business decision.''\n\n   In telephone interviews before Eric's death, Chen and an\nofficial at Synpac declined to address those questions. They would\nnot explain how long it took to produce the enzyme, or say whether\nenough could be made in time to treat him.\n\n   Initially, Chen said Synpac had declared that the baby could not\nbe treated, but Synpac officials said Chen had decided. Finally,\nboth Synpac and Chen blamed a third party, the company\nmanufacturing the drug, which they declined to name.\n\n   But Chen said that if the drug were available, he would want to\ntreat Eric. ``Other than the parents, I am probably the one most\ndesperate to help these babies.''\n\n   By late September, the Godek family had appealed to Synpac, the\norphan drug office at the FDA and even their United States senator,\nRichard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who called Synpac on their\nbehalf, to no avail.\n\n   Dr. Haffner said that the orphan drug office was also powerless\nto help. The FDA can let patients have unapproved drugs for\n``compassionate use,'' she said, but cannot help if the drug is not\navailable. If the problem had been money, she said, Synpac could\nhave asked the FDA for a grant.\n\n   Ms. Meyers, of the rare disease organization, said,\n``Biotechnology companies, being small and not as wealthy, don't\nhave the money to invest in manufacturing a huge amount of a drug\nbefore they know whether the FDA is going to approve it or not. If\nit costs $50 million to make it and the FDA doesn't approve it,\nthey'll go bankrupt. They hold back until they get approval.''\n\n   She said that in several cases, even when new orphan drugs were\napproved and marketed, companies could not meet the demand for\nthem. For example, she said, new treatments for multiple sclerosis\nand Lou Gehrig's disease were initially in such short supply that\npatients had to enter their names into lotteries to obtain the\ndrugs.\n\n   ``American patients are not used to rationing,'' she said. ``The\nrest of the world is. I think people in the United States are going\nto have to get used to it. It's going to happen more and more.''\n\n   Time ran out on the morning of Sept. 28 when, after a night of\nstruggling to breathe, Eric Godek died at a hospital in Peoria.\n\n   Later that day, Godek said that he and his wife would always\nwonder whether their son's death might have been avoided. ``I'm\ntrying not to be bitter,'' Mrs. Godek said. ``But something has to\nbe done so this doesn't happen again and again and again.''\n","Headline":"\nDRUG COMPANIES GET RICH BY ADOPTING `ORPHANS' \n","Text":["\n   If there was a defining moment, a single event that foretold the\nsadness to come, Eric Godek's parents do not mention it.
