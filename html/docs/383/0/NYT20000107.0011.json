We'll oppose it obviously.''\n\n   Such requests rarely result in new trials.\n\n   Green, who is now 48, is being held in maximum security at the\nTopeka Correctional Facility in Kansas. She will be eligible for\nparole consideration in 2035.\n\n   Green's case drew national media attention and was the subject\nof a book by Seattle author Ann Rule.\n\n   It was only after Green was sent to the penitentiary and taken\noff the medication that she recognized the effect of her medical\nconditions and the drugs on her ability to make decisions,\naccording to her motion.\n\n   The petition stated that she suffered from severe depression,\nsevere anxiety, psychosis and bipolar disorder with manic episodes.\nShe was being treated with antidepressants, antipsychotics and\nanticonvulsants, the petition said.\n\n   The mixture of mental illness and drugs made her unable to\nunderstand what was happening and unable to communicate with her\nattorneys ``in a rational and meaningful sense,'' according to her\nclaim.\n\n   Because she was incompetent to make those decisions, her\npetition said, she was denied her right to a fair trial and due\nprocess of law.\n\n   She was represented at the time by Dennis Moore, now a U.S.\ncongressman, and Kevin Moriarty.\n\n   Both said Thursday that they had not seen the motion yet and\ncould not comment.\n\n   At Green's plea hearing in April 1996, District Judge Peter\nRuddick questioned her about the drugs she was taking and whether\nshe was able to understand what was happening in court.\n\n   She said she knew what she was doing and didn't want to compound\nthe suffering of her family and surviving daughter by taking the\ncase to trial.\n\n   ``I believe that it is best to end this now so that we can begin\nto heal from this horrible loss,'' she said in court that day.\n\n   At her sentencing in May of that year, she read a statement that\ncautioned against ignoring the signs of alcohol abuse and mental\nillness.\n\n   ``Alcohol, psychiatric illness and even more basic communication\nfailures within our family set the stage for this tragedy,'' she\nsaid in court. ``I do not seek to use that fact to escape my\npersonal responsibility.''\n\n   Green's former husband, Mike Farrar, nearly died from the\ncomplications of the poisoning attempts that occurred in the months\nbefore the fatal fire, and had to undergo surgery a number of\ntimes.\n\n   He has since remarried, and he and his surviving daughter, now\n15, are doing well, he said Thursday.
