KORNBLUT  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   By most accounts, Gena Spero left the sane world 15 years ago.\nArrested after her best friend was found strangled in a bathtub in\n1983, she has lived in state institutions ever since, her behavior\nunder close medical watch, her eyes hollowed from an array of\nanti-psychotic drugs.\n\n   Spero was never convicted of the murder. She never even faced\ntrial, appearing too psychotic in annual competency reviews for\ndoctors to recommend her case move forward, refusing to take\nmedication that would aid her coherence.\n\n   But now, at age 35, Spero is scheduled for trial. Last month,\nafter more than a decade of treatment, a psychiatrist suddenly\ndeclared her competent to face a first-degree murder charge in the\nkilling of Gina Sindoni, a 21-year-old Hampshire College student.\n\n   Like a growing number of mental patients, specialists say, Spero\ncould be edging back toward the world of sanity with the help of\ncomprehensive treatment. Though her doctor says there is ``no magic\npill,'' she is clearly a beneficiary of medical research, which has\nbrought a better understanding of psychiatric disease.\n\n   But with that understanding may come a price: If convicted,\nSpero faces life in prison. Her psychiatric treatment could\ndiminish. And her mental fitness _ which her attorney says is\nfleeting, anyway _ could disappear as quickly as it came.\n\n   ``Remember the movie `Awakenings'?'' said Dr. Paul Appelbaum,\nreferring to the 1990 blockbuster about a doctor who raises\nencephalitis patients out of their comas.\n\n   ``It's not quite that dramatic,'' continued Appelbaum, the chair\nof the department of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts\nMedical Center. ``But you've now got people who've been psychotic\nfor decades, who get these new medications and suddenly aren't\npsychotic anymore, and are asking, `What happened to the last 20\nyears of my life?'''\n\n   There are no statistics on how many mental patients who avoided\ncriminal trials due to their lack of fitness are now facing\nlong-dormant charges, specialists say, but the number of patients\nbeing brought into competency is clearly rising.\n\n   In Massachusetts, the number of suspects incompetent to stand\ntrial is recorded together with the number of convicts found guilty\nby reason of insanity _ for a total of about 700 a year, according\nto a spokesman for the Department of Mental Health.\n\n   But with the development over the last 10 years of new\nmedication known as ``atypical anti-psychotic'' drugs _ which work\nin neurotransmitter systems that were ignored until the 1980s _\npsychotic suspects are expected to regain competency more quickly\nthan a decade ago.\n\n   ``There are a couple of different factors that influence how and\nwhy a person might take a long time to be restored to competency,''\nsaid Steven Schwartz, a mental-health lawyer at the Center for\nPublic Representation in Northampton.\n\n   ``Drugs have become much better. More people are getting\nrestored quicker,'' he said. ``And after a serious crime, it can\ntake years for the pain of that experience to get addressed in some\nway.''\n\n   Spero's drug regimen is confidential. Even her precise diagnosis\nis a mystery. Dr. David Greenleaf, the Medfield State Hospital\npsychiatrist who assessed Spero for the court, described her\ncondition as ``puzzling.'' But he confirmed that it is most likely\na form of schizophrenia, and that her recent recovery is best\nexplained as a combination of the passage of time and\n``comprehensive treatment.''\n\n   Spero was arrested eight days after the death of Sindoni, a\nBeverly native whom she met in a women-only boarding house in\nBoston. Each woman had a long history of psychiatric treatment, and\ntheir shared troubles had brought them together _ occasionally in a\nromantic relationship, according to reports at the time.\n\n   On Jan. 10, 1983, Sindoni was found dead in the soapy water of a\nbathtub inside the Haverhill apartment of Michael Costas, a\nboyfriend of Spero's. Joe Spero, a Haverhill police officer,\nimmediately brought his daughter to see attorney Steven Colella,\nwho described his young client as ``obviously psychotic.''\n\n   Over the next 15 years she repeatedly was found incompetent to\nstand trial. Although she was treated successfully with\npsychotropic drugs in the months after her arrest, Colella advised\nSpero not to take her medicine when it came time for assessment, so\nthat she would appear before a judge and jury as psychotic as she\nwas at the time of the killing.\n\n   And so the case dragged. After three years at MCI-Framingham,\nSpero was transferred to a maximum-security unit at Medfield State\nHospital, where she remains. Once a year she was evaluated for\nmental fitness; in 1992, she was even declared competent to stand\ntrial, briefly. But the psychiatrist changed his opinion at a court\nappearance, and minutes later Spero collapsed with a seizure,\naccording to Essex County Assistant District Attorney Kevin\nMitchell.\n\n   Over the past year, however, Spero has shown an ``attitudinal\nshift,'' said Greenleaf, who has evaluated her for the past five\nyears.\n\n   Colella said she is still being medicated, and whether to take\nthe medicine before her next hearing on July 22 is now ``her\ndecision.'' Greenleaf said her lucidity is the product of\ncomprehensive treatment and therapy, not drugs alone. Either way,\nSpero has adjusted her perspective on facing the charges against\nher, Greenleaf said.\n\n   Whereas once she was unable to speak or sit up during a court\nhearing _ and was ``destabilized by the thought of a trial'' _\nSpero can now discuss the case.\n\n   ``What was profoundly different is that she can now sit with\nthis painful stuff,'' Greenleaf said. ``She seems to want to move\nforward. She has slowly gotten better.
