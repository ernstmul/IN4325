The cut will take a lot longer to heal, if it ever\ndoes heal.''\n\n   Schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by delusions and\nhallucinations, according to University of Florida researchers who\nreported last month on brain structure differences that could lead\nto tools for diagnosing or predicting the illness. The roughly 2.5\nmillion schizophrenics in the United States might hear voices no\none else hears or sense they're being spied on or persecuted, but\nthey do not have the multiple personalities that pop culture often\nerroneously attributes to them.\n\n   ``It's marked by a feeling of: `I don't belong,''' says\npsychologist Dennis O'Grady, who treats schizophrenics individually\nand works with SA. ```And you're telling me by how you're treating\nme that I am correct.'''\n\n   Therapy helps schizophrenics see that the world isn't as\nthreatening and dangerous as their instincts tell them, O'Grady\nsays. It also can teach them how to cope with everyday stresses,\nsays Bentley, ``how to think of alternatives rather than suicide.''\n\n   From cooking to people skills, she says, the mentally ill need\nto learn life fundamentals that others take for granted. ``I don't\nknow why society thinks if you're mentally ill, you can't learn\nanything. Nothing could be farther from the truth.''\n\n   In recent months, NAMI has tried to make support and knowledge\nmore available for those with psychoses by establishing what it\ncalls COPE, for Caring, Outreach, Partnership and Education. The\nresource program, also directed toward family members, includes a\nconsumer guide about patient empowerment, a housing guide, a family\nguide with productive ways of coping and a resource directory.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ The benefits of psychotherapy and social support,\nlong recognized in treating depressive disorders, also are gaining\nacceptance as an essential element in treating schizophrenia and\nother mental illnesses that involve psychoses.\n","\n   ``We know that people with severe mental illness need more than\na pill and a doctor's visit,'' says Laurie Flynn, executive\ndirector of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).\nVicki Lynn Bentley of Dayton, founder of the area's Schizophrenics\nAnonymous (SA) support group chapter, has known that for a long\ntime.\n","\n   ``The medication is like a Band-Aid,'' says Bentley, explaining\nthe value of her psychotherapy at the VA Medical Center. ``A person\nhas symptoms _ hearing voices, anxiety, whatever _ and medication\nalone is just like sticking a Band-Aid on a cut without adding any\nmedicine to it.
