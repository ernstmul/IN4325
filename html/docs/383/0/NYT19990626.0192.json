(mk) \n By ROBERT PEAR   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will try to reconcile two\nseemingly contradictory goals this week when he unveils a plan to\ncut the long-term cost of Medicare while expanding the program to\ncover prescription drugs, administration officials said Saturday.\n\n   His plan would make structural changes in Medicare to encourage\ncompetition and efficiency in the care of the elderly and the\ndisabled. It would also require major new infusions of cash from\nthe federal treasury, said officials who are putting final details\nof the plan in place.\n\n   The officials said Clinton would insist that the government\noffer drug coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. Drug\ncoverage should be ``universal, voluntary and heavily subsidized,''\na White House official said.\n\n   By contrast, Republicans and some Democrats in Congress want to\nstart gradually, by covering medicines for the lower-income\nbeneficiaries who most need assistance.\n\n   Regardless of what happens to his proposal, Clinton will reshape\nthe debate simply by demanding that coverage of prescription drugs\nbe made available to all Americans over the age of 64 and to those\nof any age who are severely disabled.\n\n   ``Saying that the benefit has to be universal is a major\ncontribution to the debate,'' said Martin Corry, director of\nfederal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons.\n\n   Though often lost in the hubbub over new benefits, the original\nreason for trying to redesign Medicare was to avert a financial\ncrisis. Administration officials said the president's plan would\nkeep Medicare solvent in these ways:\n\n   _ The federal government would steer Medicare patients to\ncertain hospitals that promise to give the government a deep\ndiscount on complicated, expensive procedures like heart bypass\nsurgery and hip replacement operations. Many studies have found a\nhigher quality of care at hospitals that perform a large number of\nsuch procedures.\n\n   _ Medicare would use competitive bidding to buy a wide range of\ngoods and services, including hospital beds, wheelchairs and other\nmedical equipment. The government would also try to negotiate\nprices far below those set in existing fee schedules.\n\n   _ Medicare would get a huge infusion of cash from the treasury:\n$700 billion, representing 15 percent of federal budget surpluses\nanticipated over the next 15 years.\n\n   A remarkable transformation seems to have occurred in the last\nyear. The question now is not whether Medicare should cover\nprescription drugs, but how.\n\n   Disagreements over that question, including the sheer complexity\nof designing a benefit affordable to both elderly people and to the\ntreasury, could easily stymie efforts to provide drug coverage in\nthis Congress. But the issue will become more urgent as 76 million\nbaby boomers qualify for Medicare over the next three decades.\n\n   Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said:\n``The desired outcome is to cover prescription drugs for everybody.\nThat's the approach we're contemplating. Large numbers of middle-\nand upper-income Medicare beneficiaries have little or no drug\ncoverage, but high out-of-pocket drug costs. If you target the\nsolution to low-income people, you're not taking care of the\nproblem at all.\n\n   ``Beneficiaries have paid for Medicare throughout their working\ncareers,'' Jennings said. ``If you say that certain people on\nMedicare can have drug coverage and others don't, you will\nundermine the broad support that exists for the program.''\n\n   Clinton will depict drug coverage as one element in a\ncomprehensive plan to shore up Medicare, White House officials\nsaid. But health policy experts and politicians doubt that Medicare\ncan be ``fixed'' by the passage of one bill, however comprehensive.\nIn the next two decades, they predict, Congress will continually\ntinker with the program, searching for ways to enhance benefits\nwhile trimming payments to hospitals, doctors and other health care\nproviders.\n\n   Almost every type of health care provider is pleading with\nCongress to restore Medicare money cut just two years ago by the\nBalanced Budget Act. Thus, beneficiaries, eager for drug coverage,\nand health care providers have competing claims to the same pot of\nmoney.\n\n   Administration officials said they were ready to portray the\ncoming debate over Medicare as a struggle between needy\nbeneficiaries and a greedy health care industry. So far, they said,\nthe 1997 cuts appear to have done more harm to the financial\ncondition of the industry than to the health of beneficiaries.\n\n   Nursing homes, home care agencies and health maintenance\norganizations have been complaining bitterly about the cuts. But\nCorry of the AARP said, ``There has not been a spontaneous outcry\namong beneficiaries, or an upsurge in complaints about denial of\naccess to home care, nursing homes or hospitals.''\n\n   Clinton describes affordable prescription drugs as ``the\ngreatest growing need of seniors.'' And he notes that drugs have\nbecome an integral, indispensable part of modern medical care.\n\n   Elderly people use one-third of all prescription drugs sold in\nthe United States. On average, each Medicare beneficiary has more\nthan 18 prescriptions filled each year.\n\n   But the White House says that 15.5 million Medicare\nbeneficiaries have no insurance for prescription drugs, and 6\nmillion of those beneficiaries have incomes more than twice the\nofficial poverty level. The poverty level this year is $8,240 for\nan individual and $11,060 for a couple.\n\n   Virtually every member of Congress has heard pleas from\nconstituents unable to afford medicines they need. ``The public in\nAmerica is getting gouged,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.\n``That's what our constituents tell us.''\n\n   nn\n\n   But Congress is cautious, and the reason can be summarized in\none word: cost.\n\n   From 1992 to 1997, national spending on prescription drugs grew\nby an average of 11 percent a year, which is more than double the 5\npercent rate for health care spending overall. The increase\nreflects the development of new, more expensive, more effective\ndrug therapies and greater use of prescription drugs, driven in\npart by more aggressive marketing aimed directly at consumers.\n\n   Insurers and health maintenance organizations report that drugs\nare their fastest-growing cost.\n\n   Medicaid, the federal-state program for poor families, does\ncover prescription drugs, and even though it gets substantial\ndiscounts from manufacturers, Medicaid now spends more on drugs\nthan on doctors' services.\n\n   Kevin Concannon, the commissioner of human services in Maine,\nsaid the state's Medicaid program spent $140 million a year on\nprescription drugs, compared with $40 million on doctors' services.\n\n   Stephen deMontmollin, vice president of AvMed Health Plan, a\nlarge nonprofit HMO in Florida, said drug spending for his members\nrose 33 percent last year, to $115 million.\n\n   At a congressional hearing last week, Republican senators like\nWilliam Roth Jr. of Delaware, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John\nChafee of Rhode Island expressed support for Medicare coverage of\ndrugs, but said it should be provided first to the neediest\nbeneficiaries. Moderate Democratic senators like John Breaux of\nLouisiana and Max Baucus of Montana agreed.\n\n   Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging,\nexpressed the view of the Republican majority. He cautioned against\n``any rich new benefit'' and said, ``A targeted approach, focusing\non low-income seniors, is the best solution.''\n\n   Breaux was chairman of a 17-member commission that was supposed\nto advise Congress and the president on the future of Medicare. The\npanel did not agree on much, but did provide authoritative\nbipartisan backing for the view that Medicare is antiquated because\nit does not cover prescription drugs.\n\n   Breaux proposed drug coverage for 3 million low-income\nbeneficiaries, and he said it would cost the government $60 billion\nover 10 years. The White House rejected the proposal as\n``inadequate and inefficient.''\n\n   Liberal Democrats, led by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts\nand Reps. Henry Waxman and Pete Stark of California, agree with\nClinton that drug coverage should be available to all\nbeneficiaries.\n\n   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a premium of $45.50 a month.\nUnder current law, with no change in benefits, the monthly premium\nis expected to double in a decade, to $101 in 2009. Any premium for\nprescription drug coverage would be added to that.\n\n   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the poorest\npeople would not have to pay the full premium for drug coverage\nunder Clinton's plan. ``Some people will get help with the premium\nat the lower end of the scale,'' he said.\n\n   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer\ngroup, said, ``It makes sense for seniors to pay a significant part\nof the cost through a premium.'' But, he said, it is ``absolutely\nessential'' for the government to pay the premiums for Medicare\nbeneficiaries with incomes as much as 35 percent above the poverty\nlevel.\n\n   ``Administration officials told me they were willing to pay the\nfull premium on the drug benefit for people with incomes up to 120\npercent of the poverty level,'' Pollack said. ``I urged them to do\nbetter than that, to go to 135 percent.''\n\n   Low-income beneficiaries are already eligible for federal\nassistance in paying their basic Medicare premiums. But in studies\ngoing back to 1991, Pollack has repeatedly documented the failure\nof the federal government and the states to locate the people\neligible for such subsidies.\n\n   Medicare officials have told the White House that if Medicare\nbegins to cover prescription drugs, many more low-income people\nwould have an incentive to step forward and claim the federal\nsubsidies to which they are entitled.\n","Headline":"\nCLINTON PLANS TO CUT LONG-TERM COST OF MEDICARE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will try to reconcile two\nseemingly contradictory goals this week when he unveils a plan to\ncut the long-term cost of Medicare while expanding the program to\ncover prescription drugs, administration officials said Saturday.\n","\n   His plan would make structural changes in Medicare to encourage\ncompetition and efficiency in the care of the elderly and the\ndisabled.
