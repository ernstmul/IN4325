Times News Service   \n\n   Schizophrenia, the devastating mental illness that afflicts an\nestimated 2.7 million Americans, is rarely diagnosed until it\nbecomes full-blown.

The\nteen-agers take tests measuring their intellectual, medical and\npsychiatric fitness for military service.\n\n   As part of the screening, the adolescents were asked about their\npersonal relationships, their general level of maturity and\nautonomy, and their ability to organize their lives. The questions\nincluded: How many good friends do you have? How often are you late\nfor school? Who cleans your room? Do you tend to be the center of\nattention at parties?\n\n   Young men who were deemed healthy by the draft board but were\nlater hospitalized for schizophrenia, the researchers found, had\nshown subtle abnormalities in intellectual and social functioning\non the screening tests. Their scores on all the measures included\nin the study were significantly lower than those of a comparable\ngroup of teen-agers who did not fall ill.\n\n   Using the test scores, Davidson and his colleagues were able to\nclassify 87.5 percent of the adolescents correctly according to\nwhether they would become ill. The study appears in this month's\nissue of The American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n   Davidson said in an interview that while more research needed to\nbe done, his study and others documenting early warning signs of\nschizophrenia were raising ``major issues'' about how early\ntreatment should begin.\n\n   Researchers at Yale University and in Australia are already\nusing antipsychotic drugs experimentally to treat subjects who are\nat high risk for schizophrenia and display early signs of the\nillness, though they do not have definitive symptoms. But though a\nnew generation of drugs for psychosis have fewer side effects than\nolder medications, the treatments are not without risk.\n\n   ``Maybe five years from now we'll have drugs with even fewer\nadverse effects,'' Davidson said. ``The issue is that if my\nfindings and other people's findings are true, at a certain point\nwe have to begin treating people who have very mild symptoms. In a\nway, it's like finding a gene _ do you treat asymptomatic people\nwho have a gene for breast cancer?''\n\n   Dr. Kenneth Davis, chairman of psychiatry at Mount Sinai\nHospital in New York City, said the study offered the possibility\n``that we might really be able to identify people with a high risk\nand be able to do something about it.''\n\n   He said studies showed that the longer a first episode of\nschizophrenia went untreated, the poorer patients did in the long\nrun. ``You don't want to label people inappropriately,'' he said.\nBut providing ``aggressive and effective treatment may result in a\nbetter long-term course.''\n","Headline":"\nSTUDY DETECTS EARLY SIGNS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA \n","Text":["\n   Schizophrenia, the devastating mental illness that afflicts an\nestimated 2.7 million Americans, is rarely diagnosed until it\nbecomes full-blown.
