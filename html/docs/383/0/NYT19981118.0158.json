Katz served on the 1972\nfederal panel that examined the Tuskegee study.\n\n   OPRR has investigated only a handful of the more than two dozen\nfederally funded institutions that have conducted psychiatric\n``challenge'' or ``withdrawal'' studies over the last 25 years.\nThese were studies in which mentally ill patients were either\npushed towards psychosis with amphetamines or other powerful\nstimulants or deprived of their medication to examine the return of\npsychotic symptoms.\n\n   When the agency does find problems, it has no authority to fine\nor discipline, only to call for changes so that the institution\ncomplies with its main oversight tool _ the ``assurance'' document,\nan upfront promise by the institution that it will abide by federal\nresearch regulations.\n\n   At a congressional hearing in June, Gary B. Ellis, director of\nOPRR, defended his agency and the local review boards.\n\n   ``What is the possibility of a catastrophic failure in human\njudgment running through six or more layers?

We need to understand much\nmore about the justification for them,'' Flynn said. ``It seems to\nus that they are high-risk studies and we do not want to expose\npeople to this kind of challenge if there is another way to move\nscience forward.''\n\n   She said that NAMI has set up different foundations to accept\nindustry donations to avoid having the main organization be\ninfluenced by pharmaceutical companies.\n\n   For example, the main organization has a foundation to fight\nstigmatization of the mentally ill, which receives $3.2 million\nannually from nine pharmaceutical companies, Flynn said.

Torrey has long been seen as a friend and\npowerful advocate for the mentally ill, which made his letter to\nAlcorn all the more disheartening to Alcorn and his supporters.\n\n   For other people who have been diagnosed with mental illness,\nthe attitude of such scientists is a major reason they want special\nresearch protections.\n\n   ``Are people being subjected to research with the potential of\nbeing beneficial to them?
