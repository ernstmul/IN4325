Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ In another First Amendment defeat for the Giuliani\nadministration, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled Friday that city\nofficials had improperly retaliated against an AIDS service\norganization that had been critical of the mayor by moving to make\nit ineligible for millions of dollars in federal money.\n\n   The group, called Housing Works, has been a relentless opponent\nof Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's policies on AIDS, using guerrilla\nprotest tactics like blocking rush-hour traffic on bridges and\ntunnels, interrupting the news conferences of city officials and\nconducting sit-ins in city offices.\n\n   The group operates two homes _ in Lower Manhattan and in the\nEast New York section of Brooklyn _ for homeless people with AIDS,\nmental illness or drug addiction.
