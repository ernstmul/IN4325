Mentally ill patients in challenge\nstudies were given a stimulant such as amphetamine to stir symptoms\nof their psychosis; in withdrawal studies, patients were taken off\ntheir medication so they could be observed as their symptoms\nreturned.\n\n   Many past efforts to ensure the ethics of research have been\nineffective, authorities noted.\n\n   A policy adopted by the International Committee of Medical\nJournal Editors, requiring researchers to indicate whether they\nconducted their studies in accordance with ethical standards, has\nnot prevented the challenge studies from being published.\n\n   ``I don't think it's a very effective mechanism for the\nregulation of research,'' said Leonard Glantz, professor of health\nlaw at Boston University School of Public Health. ``Journals are\ntoo distant from events that went on. It's sort of\nafter-the-fact.''\n\n   A 1997 bill to criminalize unethical research, filed by Senator\nJohn Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is leaving office next year, has\nlanguished. The Human Research Subject Protections Act he proposed\nwould have penalized researchers who failed to get proper informed\nconsent and ethical review in all experiments, whether publicly or\nprivately funded.\n\n   Over the last 20 years, federal commissions have repeatedly\ncalled for special research protections for people with mental\nillness, without success.\n\n   A presidentially appointed National Bioethics Advisory\nCommission last week recommended such protections be adopted, but\nsome legislators, ethicists, and mental health advocates worry that\nits proposals either do not go far enough or will be largely\nignored.\n\n   Halloran, the House committee counsel, said he was particularly\nconcerned that the advisory commission did not take a strong stance\non research that exacerbates psychotic symptoms, or on safeguarding\nthe rights of people with mental illness who do not have the\ncapacity to consent meaningfully to take part in research.\n\n   ``It's disappointing they couldn't advance the ball on those\nsubjects,'' Halloran said.\n\n   Adil Shamoo, a University of Maryland bioethicist and editor of\nthe journal Accountability in Research, said he viewed some of the\nadvisory commission's report as positive, but ``I think\nfundamentally it's flawed. They did not prohibit the worst-case\nscenarios.''\n\n   Harold Shapiro, National Bioethics Advisory Commission chairman\nand president of Princeton University, said last week that while\nthe commission only has authority to recommend regulations to the\nWhite House, ``we hope that the report will be convincing to enough\npeople, that people will be inclined to take these recommendations\nseriously.''\n\n   Psychiatric researchers, on the other hand, have objected to the\nadvisory commission's recommendations as going too far and\nthreatening to paralyze research that could help improve\nunderstanding of and treatments for mental illness.\n\n   For instance, in a letter to the commission, Dr. Robert W.\nBuchanan of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, which has\nconducted some of the challenge studies, said some of the\ncommission's recommendations ``reinforce concerns'' among\nresearchers that the commission is ``antipsychiatric research.''\n\n   Said Shapiro: ``You never 100 percent satisfy anyone. Either you\nask too much or you ask too little. This is our best judgment.''\n\n   But for medical ethicist Annas, who in the 1970s served as a\nconsultant on the first national commission to call for special\nprotections for people with mental illness, that is not good\nenough.\n\n   ``We need an agency to do something, to protect human subjects,\nto hold researchers accountable,'' said Annas, adding that the\nGlobe series is helping to push the calls for a strong national\nboard. ``It's time.''\n","Headline":"\nOVERSIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CALLED FAULTY\n","Text":["\n   Saying the existing system for protecting people in research\nfails to do the job, a congressional committee and medical\nethicists called last week for an independent national board with\nthe power to enforce rigorous standards and prevent harm.\n","\n   Citing psychiatric research abuses detailed in a Globe series\nlast week as adding impetus to efforts to create such a board,\nlegislators and ethicists said the move is urgently needed because\nof the rapid pace of research and the poorly funded and overworked\nstate of research review boards.\n","\n   Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut,\nplans to file a bill next year to create such a board, said\nLawrence Halloran, staff director and counsel for the House\nSubcommittee on Human Resources, which is chaired by Shays.\n","\n   ``That is going to be the centerpiece of our legislation,'' said\nHalloran, adding that the Globe's findings are helping to propel\nthe committee's efforts. ``Mr. Shays sees more than ever a need for\na permanent national bioethics panel,'' Halloran said, to set\ntraining and research standards, and to serve as a central registry\nof review boards and research.\n","\n   Some medical ethicists want such a panel to go even further, by\nhaving the authority to sanction researchers deemed to have acted\nunethically.\n","\n   ``You have to have real live penalties for violating the rights\nof subjects _ like fines and jail,'' said George Annas, chairman of\nBoston University's health law department, who plans on drafting\nlegislation to create a board able to impose sanctions.\n","\n   Dr. Jay Katz, a Yale University professor emeritus of law,\nmedicine, and psychiatry who was the first to call for such a\nnational board, agreed: ``If you don't have any teeth in the\nregulations, that creates problems.''\n","\n   The Globe series detailed how psychiatric researchers for the\npast 25 years have conducted a series of ``challenge'' and drug\nwithdrawal studies in order to examine the biology of the disease,\nnot treat the patients' illness.
