Times News Service    \n\n   There may not be a writer in America in a more delicate spot\nthan Chris Gerolmo. He is the Hollywood screenwriter (``Mississippi\nBurning'') and director who had completed the script of ``Laws of\nMadness,'' the Michael Laudor story, and was prepared to start\nshooting it when Laudor, a schizophrenic who became an academic\nstar at Yale, was charged with the brutal stabbing of his pregnant\nfiancee, Caroline Costello.\n\n   When Ms. Costello was murdered, the reigning assumption was that\n``Laws of Madness,'' a project of Ron Howard's Imagine\nEntertainment, had died as well. It was no longer a movie with an\ninspirational Hollywood ending. It was no longer ``a Ron Howard\nmovie.'' Or, as Gerolmo put it when I interviewed him this week,\n``People who want to finance this movie want to make money, and\novercoming affliction is a genre which Hollywood is comfortable\nwith. It's harder to get a movie made that ends with a disaster.''\n\n   But, he added, ``I still think there is a great story to be\ntold, though it's gotten more complex and doesn't have the kind of\nclear message it had before.'' He wondered, though, if the\nmental-health community, which had looked at Laudor as a ``poster\nboy,'' would welcome the idea of a revised, tragic version any more\nwarmly than might bottom-line-driven Hollywood.\n\n   The answer could be yes _ if Gerolmo can bring off the\ncomplexity to which he aspires. In mass culture, where so many\nbattles are fought for American public opinion, no one may fare\nworse than the mentally ill. The National Alliance for the Mentally\nIll is desperate to get accurate stories out _ the sad ones too _\nbecause it knows that as long as mental illness is stigmatized,\npublic policy will be backward and discriminatory, whether\nadministered by the government, corporations or HMOs. Of the two\nmillion-plus schizophrenics in the United States, more than half\nget inadequate treatment, according to a study released in March.\n\n   On screen, the mentally ill are more likely to be exploited for\nslash-movie cash or hammed up for Oscar-seeking performances than\ndramatized accurately. Otto Wahl, a psychologist who wrote ``Media\nMadness,'' a study of mental illness in entertainment, points out\nthat ``Halloween,'' with its homicidal maniacs, remains the\nhardiest Hollywood perennial. The ``positive'' alternative is often\na movie like ``Shine,'' which blurs the nature and causes of mental\nillness while tacking on a simplistically triumphant denouement.\n``The happy ending in which you go off to life in the suburbs with\nyour Ford Explorer and your wife and your dog is also a tremendous\ndisservice,'' says Peter Weiden, who has long treated\nschizophrenics at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York.\n\n   A true story is much more nuanced. ``There's so much more to\ntreating schizophrenia than a doctor's visit and a pill, no matter\nhow good that pill is,'' says Rona Purdy of the National Alliance.\nThough new medicines have brought huge advances to schizophrenics,\nthey are not a cure. Ms. Purdy feels that people should ``see the\nhorrible pain of Laudor's mother and fiancee as they tried to get\nhim care in the last days'' when he abandoned his medication and\nmay have been forcefully resisting any kind of medical\nintervention. ``There's no such thing as a simple intervention,''\nshe says. ``In the end, it's the moms that are left with these\ngreat big sick sons.''\n\n   Before writing his script, Chris Gerolmo screened every movie he\ncould about mental illness, from ``The Snake Pit'' on, and found\njust one, ``The Madness of King George,'' that wasn't ``hokey'' or\n``unreal.'' He also spent time with the then-thriving Laudor last\nyear. ``Michael had difficulties all the time,'' he recalls. ``He\ntold me that on a good day it took 40 percent of his mental\nenergies to keep his hallucinations off to the side _ on a bad day,\n90 percent.''\n\n   Like everyone who knew Laudor, Gerolmo is in a state of shock.\n``Laws of Madness'' is, as it must be for now, in ``moral and\ncreative limbo,'' he says.
