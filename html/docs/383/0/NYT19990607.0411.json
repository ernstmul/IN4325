Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon propose revamping the\nMedicare program to offer prescription drug coverage to all\nbeneficiaries, and he will contend that such coverage can actually\nsave money for the government by reducing the need for hospital\nstays and nursing home care, administration officials said Monday.\n\n   The officials said the drug coverage could be offered for an\nextra premium as low as $10 a month and, in any event, less than\n$25, they said.\n\n   The president intends to unveil his plan later this month as an\nalternative to one proposed in March by a 17-member advisory\ncommission. His proposal will boost efforts by Democratic lawmakers\nto cover prescription drugs, a change long sought by older\nAmericans.\n\n   White House officials said that Clinton would not try to impose\nfederal controls on drug prices. Rather, they said, under his\nproposal, the government would hire private companies to help buy\ndrugs and manage the new drug benefit. Such ``pharmacy benefit\nmanagers'' could control costs by obtaining discounts from drug\nmanufacturers and drug stores, and by preventing overuse or misuse\nof prescription drugs, the administration contends.\n\n   ``We would never do price controls,'' said a senior White House\nofficial.\n\n   The proposed drug benefit is the centerpiece of Clinton's plan\nto modernize Medicare and shore up the finances of the program for\n39 million people who are elderly or disabled. The Medicare trust\nfund is expected to run out of money in 2015, assuming no changes\nin current law.\n\n   Many Democrats say they will include prescription drug benefits\nas a major plank of their political platform next year. They look\nforward to a fight over the issue with Republicans, who are also\neager to provide drug benefits but fear that the cost of such\ncoverage could explode.\n\n   John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who has taken\ncharge of efforts to draft the president's Medicare proposal, said\nthe drug benefit would be ``universal and affordable,'' would have\n``a modest premium'' and would be ``better than anything you could\nbuy today in the open market.''\n\n   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a monthly premium of $45.50 for\ncoverage that does not include drugs. Administration officials said\nthe extra premium for drug coverage would be far less than what\nmany elderly people now pay for such coverage under private\ninsurance to fill the gaps in Medicare. Drug coverage under such\nMedigap policies often exceeds $80 a month, the White House says.\n\n   The president's plan is an alternative to the one devised by the\nco-chairmen of the 17-member commission, Sen. John B. Breaux,\nDemocrat of Louisiana, and Rep. Bill Thomas, Republican of\nCalifornia. Under the Breaux-Thomas plan, the government would\noffer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase a\npublic or private health plan.\n\n   Just hours before the panel finished work in March, Clinton said\nits final proposal ``does not provide for an adequate, affordable\nprescription drug benefit'' and could cause excessive increases in\npremiums for people in the traditional Medicare program.\n\n   Confidential White House documents, outlining Clinton's\nproposal, assert that drug coverage can save money for Medicare, by\nreducing admissions to hospitals and nursing homes, and the need\nfor home health care as well.\n\n   ``A $1 increase in pharmaceutical expenditure is associated with\na $3.65 reduction in hospital care expenditure,'' one document\nsays. Moreover, it says, effective treatment for Alzheimer's\ndisease, including drugs like tacrine, ``could keep 10 percent of\npatients out of nursing homes, thus saving billions of dollars.''\n\n   Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Medicare program, is\ntrying to estimate the cost of various options being considered by\nthe president. White House officials said they had sent Foster many\nstudies to support their contention that the proper use of drugs\ncould save money elsewhere in Medicare. But one official said it\nwas difficult to persuade Foster, because he was ``very, very\nconservative'' in his estimates.\n\n   Senior Democratic members of Congress said Clinton had not\nshared details of his proposal with them. ``We haven't heard\nanything,'' said Rep. Pete Stark of California, the ranking\nDemocrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.\n\n   Stark said he feared that the administration would cut a deal\nwith Republican leaders of the House and the Senate late this year,\nand that the resulting bill would be ``dumped on our doorstep 48\nhours before we have to vote on it.''\n\n   Administration officials said Clinton's plan would also include\nthese elements:\n\n   _ The government would encourage price competition among health\nmaintenance organizations, by requiring them to bid for the right\nto enroll Medicare beneficiaries. HMOs strenuously oppose this\nidea, because the original fee-for-service Medicare program would\nnot be included in the competition.\n\n   _ At least 15 percent of the expected federal budget surplus\nwould be pumped into Medicare, to improve the program's financial\ncondition and perhaps to help pay for drug benefits.\n\n   _ Federal officials would have broad new authority to sign\ncontracts with selected suppliers of goods and services who offer\nthe best price to Medicare.\n\n   _ Employers who now offer drug benefits to retirees would be\nallowed to buy drug coverage from Medicare, presumably at a lower\nprice than they now pay.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
