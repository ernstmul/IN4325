Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ She was the child of Holocaust survivors, born in\nBrooklyn on Christmas Eve of 1959 with good looks, keen\nintelligence and a big brother determined to protect her from all\nthe evil in the world.\n\n   But when her battered body was found in Central Park on July 22\nthis year, the police identified Susan Fuchs by a food stamp card\nand said her last address was a homeless shelter.\n\n   Her descent from middle-class promise to violent death at\nsociety's margins was part of a 20-year journey through the New\nYork mental health system. In the end, family members maintain, the\nsystem failed her, accepting her resistance to treatment though it\nwas symptomatic of her mental illness, and frustrating their own\ndesperate efforts to keep her safe.\n\n   The case also underlines how difficult it can be to help the\nmost severely mentally ill.\n\n   Public concern over the dangerously mentally ill spurred Gov.\nGeorge Pataki and state lawmakers to agree last week on legislation\ngiving the courts new authority to order former mental patients to\ncomply with treatment or face re-hospitalization.\n\n   Much of the lobbying for the new law focused on mental patients\ncharged with crimes, but Susan Fuchs herself _ repeatedly\nhospitalized against her will, deeply resistant to taking\nmedication, and tracked by relatives ready to try anything to help\nher _ also seemed to be an obvious candidate.\n\n   Tom Fuchs, who was 13 when his sister was born, and his wife,\nGloria, say they would have used the law if it had been enacted\nsooner.\n\n   Yet a close look at Susan Fuchs' troubled history, through\ninterviews, court records and hospital documents, suggests that\neven in her case, the practical effects of the law would have been\nlimited.\n\n   Indeed, as Susan Fuchs cycled through psychiatric wards,\nassisted-living programs, emergency rooms and homeless shelters,\nlaws intended to protect mental patients were ignored at crucial\npoints, and a hard-line policy of patient confidentiality made it\nhard for relatives even to find her.\n\n   ``We knew there was going to be a disaster,'' Gloria Fuchs said.\n\n   Mrs. Fuchs had covered a table in their antiques store on\nAtlantic Avenue with a jumble of documents and notes compiled in\ntheir 20-year battle to save Susan Fuchs: court orders,\ncorrespondence from doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, her\nRegents scholarship award, her first suicide note.\n\n   Each time Susan Fuchs disappeared, she was injured, said her\nbrother, a former high school teacher with a graying ponytail who\nfounded his antiques and carpentry business with his wife 20 years\nago, when their own daughter was born _ and just before his smart,\npretty sister fell apart.\n\n   Susan Fuchs graduated as a math major from SUNY-Binghamton\ndespite serious symptoms of mental illness beginning at 15, despite\na major breakdown in college. She kept spiraling downward, caught\nin the grip of ``a bipolar affective disorder, manic, severe with\npsychotic features,'' in the words of a doctor's diagnosis in a\nFeb. 12, 1991, court affidavit.\n\n   Courts repeatedly found her a danger to herself or others and\ncommitted her for involuntary hospital treatment and medication,\nbut only when someone knew or cared enough to make her madness a\nlegal matter. And when Susan rejected her family members, in part\nfor their role in her commitments, in part because of her paranoid\ndelusions, the system helped her disappear into the streets, they\nsay.\n\n   Under the new law, relatives do not have to wait for a family\nmember with such a history to become dangerous before petitioning\nthe court to order the person to submit to outpatient treatment or\nface commitment. But the person still would have to be found.\n\n   Each time Susan Fuchs was discharged from one of the dozen\nprivate and public psychiatric hospitals that treated her, Gloria\nFuchs called social workers, psychiatrists, nurses and homeless\nshelter clerks in an effort to find her, hunting for a weak link in\nthe chain of patient confidentiality that shut the family out.\n\n   Once, in 1996, they discovered her in a homeless shelter in\nCanarsie, Brooklyn, naked, bruised and delusional, her clothes\nstolen by other shelter residents. Another time, about two years\nago, she walked into their antiques store, barefoot, distraught and\ncovered with sores.\n\n   Four months before her death, they waited with her until 4 a.m.\nin the emergency room of Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn to\nsecure her psychiatric admission, after she had declared that she\nhad no family, because aliens had taken over her relatives' bodies.\n\n   The hospital discharged her at her request within a week rather\nthan seeking a court-ordered commitment, releasing her to an\naddress it would not tell the family, her brother said. Police\ninvestigators now say it was a homeless shelter, though an appeals\ncourt ruling in 1993 bar transfers to shelters.\n\n   ``We have to abide by the hospital's policy of protecting\npatient confidentiality,'' Eileen Tynan, a spokeswoman for\nMaimonides, said in declining to discuss the case.\n\n   The new law allows a judge to order a patient like Susan Fuchs\ninto the hospital for a 24-hour assessment by doctors to determine\nif court-ordered outpatient treatment is suitable. But if the\npatient refuses to comply with its terms, a doctor could put the\npatient in the hospital involuntarily for a maximum of 72 hours.\nFor a longer commitment, the old standard of dangerous behavior\nmust be met.\n\n   Susan Fuchs' delusions had repeatedly proved dangerous. When she\nhad an apartment, she set small fires to burn ``secret papers,''\naccording to a doctor's court affidavit. More recently, emergency\nroom records show, she inflicted injuries on her own face until she\nwas black and blue.\n\n   On that occasion, in January of this year, a nurse at New York\nMethodist Hospital summoned Tom Fuchs, telling him his sister had\nbeen in a padded observation room in the emergency room for three\ndays. No psychiatric beds were available, and doctors said she was\ntoo psychotic to release, Methodist Hospital officials confirm.\nFuchs signed her out and drove her to Maimonides hospital himself.\n\n   But Maimonides, which obtained a 60-day court order of\ninvoluntary commitment after that episode, discharged her as soon\nas the order expired _ to the apartment of a woman who had herself\nbeen released from a mental ward only 48 hours earlier, the Fuchses\nsay.\n\n   ``It was insane, like a Kafka play,'' Fuchs recalled, adding\nthat by the time they discovered the address a few days later,\nSusan had moved on.\n\n   nn\n\n   ``That does not constitute a proper discharge in any way, shape\nor form,'' said Shelley Nortz, director of policy for the Coalition\nfor the Homeless, which won a class-action lawsuit against what she\ncalled ``patient dumping'' in 1993. Under law, she added, New York\nMethodist itself should have transported the patient to another\nhospital.\n\n   Financial pressures have quickened discharges, and made\nhospitals less likely to try to renew involuntary commitments, said\nBarbara Jones, a lawyer for Mental Hygiene Legal Services, which\nrepresents patients at commitment hearings. ``Even when we're\nadvocates for the patients who want to leave, we're sometimes sorry\nthe facility didn't try to keep them,'' she said.\n\n   State hospitals are under pressure, too, she said. Since the\nmid-1990s, when Susan Fuchs was treated at the South Beach State\nPsychiatric Center on Staten Island, the population of such state\ncenters has been cut by 40 percent, to 6,000. For outpatient\nservices, like case managers who can monitor difficult patients,\nwaiting lists have grown.\n\n   Studies of outpatient commitment have found that patients with\ngood outpatient services did equally well with or without a court\norder. The new law's budget, $40 million, is mainly for medication.\n\n   Susan Fuchs had long rejected psychotropic drugs, which can be\nheavily sedating.\n\n   ``I am a vegetable on medication,'' she wrote in the early 1980s\nbefore leaping into the Hudson in a suicide attempt. ``I can't\nthink. I can't read. I can't enjoy anything. ... I can't live\nwithout my mind.''\n\n   That time, someone pulled her from the water. This year, Tom and\nGloria Fuchs wanted to put her in a hospital long enough to try\nnewer drugs, or at least to keep her from predators. ``A woman\nalone, deranged, wandering on the street without her glasses, so\nmyopic she couldn't even read a street sign _ she's just going to\nget hurt,'' her brother said.\n\n   But Susan Fuchs was an adult, and they were not even her\nparents. Her mother, Miriam Fuchs, a 77-year-old Auschwitz survivor\nwho declined to be interviewed, lives half the year in Florida. Her\nfather, Philip, died more than a year ago.\n\n   From Susan's perspective, moreover, the system did not promise\nsafety. Her brother said she had been sexually assaulted in\npsychiatric units by other patients.\n\n   On March 23, the Fuchses caught up with her as she picked up\ndocuments at Services for the Underserved, a nonprofit agency that\nsponsors the supervised-living program that she had left in\nJanuary, after battering her face.\n\n   ``They look like my family but their bodies have been taken over\nby others,'' she told a social worker there, according to Gloria\nFuchs' notes. The social worker called the police and an ambulance\nto take her back to Maimonides.\n\n   Within days, the Fuchses retained a lawyer to draw up a petition\nunder a recent guardianship law, asking the court to rule her\nmentally incapacitated _ a procedure that would cost several\nthousand dollars, and that required Susan Fuchs to be served with\npapers.\n\n   But she was already gone again. Maimonides had not sought a\ncourt commitment this time. The Fuchses were outraged. No hospital\nknew the severity of Susan Fuchs' illness better than Maimonides,\nthey say. Marvin H. Lipkowitz, the chief of psychiatry, had been\none of her first doctors. Gloria Fuchs appealed to him.\n\n   She recalled him as telling her: ``People like you in this\nsituation have long abandoned their mentally ill relatives. I think\nyou should explore in yourself why you are still here.''\n\n   Asked about the exchange, the psychiatrist responded, ``I may\nhave said something like that.'' But he stressed that he had not\nmeant his remarks critically. ``I was left admiring the woman,'' he\nsaid. ``Her involvement was very prolonged and had been met by all\nsorts of rejection. Many families simply abandon the case.''\n\n   In the end, it was the hospital that abandoned Susan, Gloria\nFuchs contends, and she feels the issue was money. In the emergency\nroom just before that last, brief hospitalization, she said,\nhospital employees realized that private insurance had lapsed.\nSusan Fuchs' mother had dropped the $160 monthly premium, Tom Fuchs\nsaid.\n\n   ``No patient gets treated differently because of the financial\ncoverage,'' Lipkowitz countered. ``The general rtle is that when a\ntragedy in life occurs somebody has to be blamed. I am truly sorry.\nI feel for these people.'' But he added, ``You have only half the\nstory.''\n\n   In bipolar disorders, he said, ``The individual who can be quite\npsychotic at some times can become quite normal at another time.\nYou cannot force medication on someone who does not seem obviously\npsychotic.''\n\n   To Gloria Fuchs, his responses amounted to telling them to wait\nuntil the next time Susan got hurt. Then, it was too late.\n\n   On July 22, at 2 a.m., several people heard a woman screaming in\nCentral Park but did not call the police. At 11 a.m. Susan Fuchs'\nhalf-naked body was found there, her head smashed in with a rock.\n","Headline":"\nSLAYING ENDED A LONG EFFORT TO SAVE A MENTALLY ILL WOMAN \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ She was the child of Holocaust survivors, born in\nBrooklyn on Christmas Eve of 1959 with good looks, keen\nintelligence and a big brother determined to protect her from all\nthe evil in the world.\n","\n   But when her battered body was found in Central Park on July 22\nthis year, the police identified Susan Fuchs by a food stamp card\nand said her last address was a homeless shelter.\n","\n   Her descent from middle-class promise to violent death at\nsociety's margins was part of a 20-year journey through the New\nYork mental health system.
