Davis, according to the OPRR\nletter. Davis is Mount Sinai's chairman of psychiatry.\n\n   OPRR's finding comes five years after a New York-based mental\nhealth advocate first filed a complaint with OPRR about the 1987\nstudy and raised concerns in the media.\n\n   ``I really am questioning why it took them so long. What kind of\nobstacles were there that prevented them from investigating it and\ndetermining it sooner?'' said Vera Hassner Sharav, president and\nco-founder of Citizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and\nResearch.\n\n   The nine-page OPRR letter also found violations of federal\nregulations to protect human subjects of research in two other\nnow-completed studies of schizophrenia, both of which began in the\nearly 1990s and were led by Dr. Michael Davidson. The violations\nprimarily concerned informed consent procedures.\n\n   In a statement Monday, Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it\nhas already addressed concerns now being outlined in the OPRR\nletter.\n\n   ``In 1994, when a news report raised questions concerning\ncertain studies that had been conducted in previous years, Mount\nSinai immediately and voluntarily conducted an in-depth evaluation\nof the manner in which that research was conducted, and voluntarily\nimplemented appropriate corrective actions.\n\n   ``We are gratified that in the assessment that it has just\ncompleted, the Office for Protection from Research Risks has\nacknowledged Mount Sinai's immediate response to the issues when\nthey were raised, recognized the corrective actions that Mount\nSinai implemented four years ago, and praised Mount Sinai for its\n`commitment...to the protection of human research subjects,' ''\naccording to the statement.\n\n   OPRR acknowledged that the studies in question ``have been\ncompleted for at least several years,'' and that both Mount Sinai\nand the Bronx VA conducted their own evaluations and ``instituted a\nnumber of corrective actions,'' requiring no further action on the\nagency's part.\n\n   But, according to the letter by Dr. Michael A. Carome, acting\nchief of the compliance oversight branch for OPRR's division of\nhuman subject protections, the agency must be informed of any new\ninformation that could lead to future OPRR action. In addition, he\nwrote, the agency will be visiting the institution to make sure the\ncorrective actions are being implemented adequately.\n\n   Carome and other OPRR officials did not return phone calls\nMonday.\n\n   Hassner Sharav said that while she was glad to see OPRR document\nthe violations in its determination letter, she criticized the\nagency for failing to do more.\n\n   ``This determination does not in any way hold anyone accountable\nfor worsening the illness of these people, of causing them\nunnecessary, unjustified suffering,'' Hassner Sharav said. ``Are\nthey just discards? Shouldn't the researchers and the institutions\nbe held accountable? Shouldn't there be penalties for violating\nthese. . .ethical standards?''\n\n   In its statement Monday, Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it\n``is committed to conducting clinical research in accord with the\nhighest ethical and scientific standards.''\n","Headline":"\nUS CITES SCHOOL, HOSPITAL FOR PSYCHOSIS RESEARCH FLAWS \n","Text":["\n   Mount Sinai Medical School in New York and an affiliated\nVeterans Affairs hospital did not properly protect the mentally ill\nin research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to ``at least\nsome short-term harm'' in one psychosis-inducing study, a federal\nagency has found.\n","\n   The Office for Protection from Research Risks, which monitors\nUS-funded research, documented a series of violations, ranging from\nthe failure to adequately inform subjects of the risks and nature\nof the research, to the deliberate exacerbation of psychotic\nsymptoms among patients who had been stable.\n","\n   The agency, part of the National Institutes of Health and known\nas OPRR, issued its determination in a January 28 letter to Mount\nSinai and Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which was obtained\nby The Boston Globe Monday.\n","\n   One of the studies _ which withheld antipsychotic medications\nfrom stabilized schizophrenia patients and gave them L-dopa, known\nto induce psychosis in the mentally ill _ was cited in a four-part\nseries that ran in the Globe three months ago, highlighting\npsychiatric research abuses.\n","\n   OPRR found that while that study, published in 1987, resulted in\nno long-term adverse effects, people ``suffered at least some\nshort-term harm or discomfort as evidenced by documentation of\nschizophrenia relapse in all 28 patients.''\n","\n   For instance, one of the patients in that study, after being off\nmedication for four weeks, ``became violent and struck a doctor.\nAnother patient. . .expressed suicidal ideation; and another\npatient's symptoms worsened significantly after only one day of\nbeing off medication . . . ,'' according to OPRR, citing documents\nit reviewed as part of its investigation.\n","\n   The study was led by Dr. Kenneth L.
