Times News Service    \n\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Spurred by a succession of violent attacks\ncommitted by people with schizophrenia, lawmakers are moving closer\nto an agreement on a plan that would give the courts new powers to\nforce the mentally ill into treatment against their will.\n\n   The plan being considered by legislative leaders from both\nparties would allow judges to hospitalize people temporarily if\nthey have a history of violence or have been hospitalized before\nfor mental illness and have refused to follow their prescribed\ntreatment, aides involved in the talks said.\n\n   Nearly 40 states have involuntary treatment statutes. The plan\nbeing considered in Albany could affect as many as 4,000 people a\nyear, mostly those who are able to function well while being\ntreated in a hospital but who fail to take their medicine once they\nare released.\n\n   The plan has been attacked by some advocates for the mentally\nill, but negotiators for Gov. George Pataki and Democratic\nlegislative leaders say they have reached agreement on the general\noutlines of the proposal.\n\n   Aides to the officials say two main questions are still in\ndispute. The first is whether the state would oversee and pay for\nmedicine, counseling and other treatment ordered by the courts. The\nsecond is whether judges would have the power to fine or send to\nprison a mental patient who refused to follow a court's orders for\ntreatment.\n\n   The discussions have been delayed by a protracted fight over the\nstate budget, which is now nearly 100 days late. Legislative\nleaders have said there will be little movement on other issues\nuntil a new budget is passed. ``A lot of progress has been made,''\nsaid James McGuire, the counsel for Pataki. ``We're hopeful that\nwill continue.''\n\n   The move to enact an involuntary treatment law has been prompted\nby years of concern among some mental health experts and ordinary\ncitizens about mentally ill people on the streets.\n\n   Those concerns have been heightened by several recent incidents,\nparticularly two instances of strangers being shoved in front of\nNew York City subway trains this year. In each case, the defendant\nis a schizophrenic man who had not taken medication. In one case\nthe victim died, and in the other his legs were cut off.\n\n   Critics of the legislative proposal say it does nothing to\naddress a more fundamental problem. They contend that the state has\nfailed to provide adequate finances for community-based programs,\nsuch as supervised housing and intensive case management, which\nthey say would help the most seriously mentally ill and also\nprotect the public. The critics note that the defendant in the\nfatal shoving incident, Andrew Goldstein, had tried to get help\nbefore the attack occurred, only to be turned away repeatedly by\nthe state's mental health system.\n\n   Supporters of the proposal contend that it is often the only way\nto deal with mental patients who are so gravely ill that they\nrefuse to follow treatment orders. ``The solution we are seeking\nkeeps the streets safer and keeps the mentally ill safer,'' said\nD.J. Jaffe, a board member of the Treatment Advocacy Center in\nManhattan, which supports the proposal.\n\n   Under current New York law, mentally ill people can be\ninvoluntarily committed briefly in hospitals or longer in mental\ninstitutions only if a judge deems they are a danger to themselves\nor others. That standard has been applied in a variety of ways,\nthough; one person might be committed for neglecting his basic\nneeds, and another might be committed for a violent act.\n\n   Under the outlines of the proposal, a limited list of people _\nincluding a treatment provider, a family member or roommate of a\nmentally ill person _ could ask a judge to order a patient to\ncomply with treatment or be hospitalized, aides involved in the\nnegotiations said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Negotiators generally agree on the criteria that must be met\nbefore a court can compel mentally ill people to undergo treatment\nor commit them to a hospital temporarily. The proposal would apply\nto a mentally ill person who has been hospitalized twice in the\nlast 36 months or has a history of violence.\n\n   It would also allow judges to hold patients who refuse to comply\nwith treatment orders in a hospital for up to 72 hours to determine\nwhether they need commitment in an institution. The duration of the\ncommitment would be the same as what current law provides.\n\n   Democrats are pressing for the legislation to make the state pay\nfor any court-ordered treatment, a concession to critics of the\nbill who say the problem is not so much that mental patients refuse\ntreatment but that the state's mental-health system is inadequately\nfinanced.\n\n   But negotiators for the governor disagree, saying the point of\nthe legislation is not to provide additional services to mental\npatients but to get them to follow the treatment that has already\nbeen prescribed. The governor proposes to make local governments\nresponsible for overseeing the law.\n\n   Negotiators also disagree about whether a mental patient should\nbe held in contempt of court for failing to abide by a treatment\norder issued by a judge.\n\n   Pataki's plan would allow a judge to fine or even imprison a\nmental patient who refused to follow a treatment order. Democrats\nsay that approach essentially makes mental illness a crime.\n","Headline":"\nALBANY DEBATES PLAN TO FORCE TREATMENT ON THE MENTALLY ILL\n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Spurred by a succession of violent attacks\ncommitted by people with schizophrenia, lawmakers are moving closer\nto an agreement on a plan that would give the courts new powers to\nforce the mentally ill into treatment against their will.\n","\n   The plan being considered by legislative leaders from both\nparties would allow judges to hospitalize people temporarily if\nthey have a history of violence or have been hospitalized before\nfor mental illness and have refused to follow their prescribed\ntreatment, aides involved in the talks said.\n","\n   Nearly 40 states have involuntary treatment statutes.
