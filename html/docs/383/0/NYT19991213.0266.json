It also points to\nfinancial barriers such as lack of health insurance ``parity'' for\nmental health problems.\n\n   The 500-page publication defines mental disorders as diagnosable\nconditions that impair thinking, feeling and behavior and interfere\nwith a person's capacity to be productive and enjoy fulfilling\nrelationships.\n\n   The definition encompasses mental and brain problems of varying\nseverity: depression, schizophrenia, manic depressive (bipolar)\nillness, anxiety disorders, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder, autism and others.\n\n   Joining Satcher in releasing the report were Tipper Gore, wife\nof Vice President Al Gore, Health and Human Services Secretary\nDonna Shalala and Larry Fricks, a Georgia state Division of Mental\nHealth official.\n\n   Fricks brought a group of about 100 representatives of mental\nhealth advocacy groups to their feet in a standing ovation with a\ndescription of his own recovery from mental illness, as well his\ngrandmother's unsuccessful effort to cope with the disease.\n\n   Fricks said the report's ``most important impact'' would be to\nhelp eliminate the stigma of mental disease ``so that people like\nmy grandmother will not waste their lives in self-imposed\nisolation.''\n\n   Shalala said Mrs. Gore, who serves as President Clinton's\nadviser on mental health, originally suggested a surgeon general's\nreport on mental illness.\n\n   Mental health groups expressed hope it would stimulate greater\npublic spending on mental health problems and greater public\nawareness of the issue.\n\n   ``The surgeon general puts mental health where it belongs: as a\ncornerstone of public health,'' said Michael Faenza, president of\nthe National Mental Health Association. ``This historic report\nmakes clear that mental health is integral to individuals' and the\nnation's health and should not be relegated to the sidelines of\nhealth care and public policy.''\n\n   ``Unfortunately, the report will not be worth the paper it is\nprinted on if its messages are not put into practice,'' he added.\n\n   Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for\nthe Mentally Ill, said the report documented a health crisis but\nadded that it would be ``waste of taxpayer dollars unless it\nbecomes a foundation for action.
