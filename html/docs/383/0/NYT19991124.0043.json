An internal memo by the International\nFederation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, which was\nobtained by The Chronicle, warns that ``the current and foreseeable\nenvironment at the WTO is very dangerous for the R&D industry.''\n\n   The industry's own success in fighting AIDS in Western countries\nhas highlighted the gap in access to drugs between have- and\nhave-not nations.\n\n   Combinations of newly developed antiviral drugs have helped cut\nthe U.S. AIDS death rate in half since 1996. But at a cost of more\nthan $1,000 a month, such therapies are hopelessly out of reach for\nThird World countries, where 90 percent of the world's people with\nAIDS reside.\n\n   Buried in the WTO rules, say Love and other activists, are two\ntools that could bring low-cost drugs to the poor:\n\n   -- ``Compulsory licensing,'' which allows a country to force a\ndrug company to license its patent to a local manufacturer.\n\n   -- ``Parallel importing,'' which permits poor countries to shop\nthe international market for the lowest price drug, instead of\npaying the rate charged in their countries by companies that own\nthe patent.\n\n   With this twin combination, hard-hit nations might produce their\nown AIDS pills and cut the prices they pay by more than 80 percent,\nadvocates say.\n\n   However, drugmakers see these tactics as an assault on\n``intellectual property'' protections, without which companies\nwon't make the megabuck investments in research and development\nneeded to discover new drugs for AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and\nother global killers.\n\n   They want tighter limits on the use of compulsory licenses and\nare working toward a worldwide ban on parallel imports.\n\n   ``We don't believe parallel importing is proper,'' said Mark\nGrayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers of America (PhRMA), the drug-industry trade group.\n``A lot of parallel imports come from places like India, and half\nthe time there are no active ingredients. It's killing patients,\ncausing drug resistance and giving false hope.''\n\n   Grayson said the issue is far more complex than simply marking\ndown the prices drug companies charge.\n\n   ``It's a question of governments making their choices,'' he\nsaid. ``South Africa just spent $3.5 billion on fighter jets from\nEurope. Just what are they protecting with those jets if they say\nthey are going to lose half their country to HIV?''\n\n   But a summerlong hounding by AIDS activists of Vice President Al\nGore at campaign appearances already has forced the Clinton\nadministration to rethink its opposition to efforts by South Africa\nto cut the cost of its AIDS drugs.\n\n   As late as February, a State Department lawyer boasted in a memo\nto Congress of ``a full-court press'' to stop South Africa from\nadopting compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs. Drugmakers had\nsued in South African courts to block a law permitting the\npractice.\n\n   But by September, the drug companies had suspended their lawsuit\nand Washington agreed to stop threatening South Africa with trade\nsanctions _ acknowledging that the country was on firm ground under\nWTO rules.\n\n   Although South Africa has yet to carry out any plan to make\ncheaper AIDS drugs, Thailand's Government Pharmaceutical\nOrganization said on November 12 that it intended to seek a\ncompulsory license to make the AIDS drug ddI from patent-holder\nBristol-Myers Squibb. The same WTO rules that permit compulsory\nlicenses also require negotiation of royalties payments to the drug\npatent holder. Thailand would have become the first nation to take\nthat step.\n\n   Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, of Doctors Without Borders in\nBangkok, said the goal was to produce ddI in Thailand for 66 cents\na pill, instead of the $1.23 charged by Bristol-Myers Squibb.\nThailand's bid was strengthened, he said, because ddI was\noriginally developed by U.S. scientists at the National Institutes\nof Health.\n\n   ``We have a situation here where a drug continues to be priced\nunaffordable to Thai people by a company that has not itself\ninvented the drug. I call this profiteering,'' he said.\n\n   But within days of the Bangkok announcement, the effort to gain\na license was suspended. The Thais instead are negotiating with\nBristol-Myers to lower the price.\n\n   ``We do not believe compulsory licensing is the way to go,''\nsaid Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Jane Kramer.\n\n   The outcome of Thailand's dealings with the New York drug giant\nwill be closely watched, for it may set a precedent for how\ndeveloping countries can manage the manufacture of their own AIDS\ndrugs, or determine what discounts drug companies are willing to\ngive countries that can't afford Western prices.\n\n   At the WTO conference in Seattle, the activists will attempt to\nbuild on the momentum.\n\n   ``This issue is not going to go away,'' said John James, who\npublicized Love's campaign in his San Francisco newsletter AIDS\nTreatment News. ``Ninety percent of the people in the world needing\nHIV medications are not able to afford them.''\n\n   At Seattle, it is unlikely that the rules governing compulsory\nlicensing and parallel importing will be either strengthened or\nweakened. The U.S. position, which drug companies support, is that\nthe rules governing these issues _ contained in an agreement called\nTrade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) _\nshould not be reopened for discussion.\n\n   But some nations still may push for modifications of TRIPS,\nwhich requires WTO members to comply with international patent laws\nby January 1. Venezuela, for example, wants the patent compliance\nrules suspended for ``essential medicines,'' a list of life-saving\ndrugs compiled by the United Nations.\n\n   While the industry hopes to keep discussion of drug patents off\nthe WTO agenda, the international drugmakers federation has laid\nout its positions should the matter arise. The goals include\nmeasures that would:\n\n   -- Make it more difficult for countries to shop for lower-priced\ndrugs on the world market.\n\n   -- Make it harder for generic drugmakers to gain regulatory\napproval for their products.\n\n   -- Extend patent protection for new drugs ``delayed'' by drug\napproval processes.\n\n   -- Prevent countries from blocking patents of plants and\nanimals.\n\n   -- Increase penalties for counterfeiting of patented drugs.\n\n   The group's internal memo also calls for strengthening WTO\nagreements ``in order to counter adverse consequences of government\ninterventions intended to protect public health ... or contain\nhealth care costs.''\n\n   PhRMA spokesman Grayson argues that intellectual property\nprotection can advance public health goals and that pharmaceutical\ncompanies have a long track record of social responsibility.\n\n   ``We've spent more than any other industry trying to get medical\nservices to Africa,'' he said.\n\n   The drug manufacturers insist that there are no simple solutions\nto the international AIDS crisis. The triple-combination drugs that\nare saving lives in the United States and Europe require\nsophisticated laboratory tests to monitor the type of drug and\ndosage. Most poor countries do not even have the money to buy the\nsimplest AIDS diagnostic tests.\n\n   Dr. Richard Laing, of the Boston University School of Public\nHealth, said that bypassing patents won't begin to solve the drug\naccess problem in the poorest countries. ``The vast majority of\ndrugs on the World Health Organization essential-drug list are\noff-patent. Despite that, access remains poor.''\n\n   Laing said that if compulsory licensing is used by developing\ncountries, it will make more sense to apply it to production of the\nmost cost-effective drugs _ those that can cure rather than just\ncontrol disease. For example, the anti-fungal drug fluconazole can\ncure a variety of diseases within a short time frame, whereas AIDS\nantiviral drugs work best only in three-drug combinations, have\nserious side effects and must be taken over a lifetime.\n\n   The sorry experience of tuberculosis control in developing\ncountries also should give AIDS activists pause, said Laing.\nAlthough common TB strains can be cured by a combination of\nantibiotics costing $20 to $30, incomplete therapy can breed\ndrug-resistant strains that respond only to drugs costing $2,000 to\n$3,000.\n\n   ``If AIDS drugs are used badly, resistance will develop and\npeople will transmit the resistant virus,'' he said.\n\n   AIDS activists, however, plan to keep the issue in the public\neye during the Seattle conference. ``There will be teach-ins,\nlobbying and protests,'' said Sydney Levy, campaign director for\nthe International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission.\n\n   Promoters of lower-cost drugs to developing countries hope to\npersuade trade ministers to impanel a WTO working group to look\ninto access to ``essential medicines,'' perhaps in concert with the\nU.N.'s World Health Organization.\n\n   AIDS activist Eric Sawyer, co-founder of the Health Gap\nCoalition and someone whose life has been saved by antiviral drugs,\ntypifies the passion that is driving American AIDS activists to the\ninternational arena. At AIDS conferences, he has sat side by side\nwith activists from developing countries who do not have the same\naccess to antiviral drugs.\n\n   ``I watch them die in front of my eyes. It rips me apart,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   As a prominent international activist, Sawyer gets e-mails from\ncolleagues overseas begging for supplies of the triple-combination\ndrugs. ``I have to say, `I wish I could help you, but I can't.'
