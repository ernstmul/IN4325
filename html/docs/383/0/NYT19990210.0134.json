And in New York,\nshe said, increased spending on prison construction is an example\nof how the ``prison-industrial complex'' robs funding and attention\nfrom education, health care, and treatment of mental illness and\ndrug addiction.\n\n   Often, those serving long prison sentences for nonviolent drug\ncrimes would pose little danger to others in their community, but\ntheir incarceration serves a political urge to ``construct an\nenemy,'' she said. She equated it with the Cold War view of\nCommunists as the enemy.\n\n   Meanwhile, prison expansion serves an ever-expanding world of\ncapitalist commercial interests _ including collect telephone\nservices, construction trades and the sale of security technology _\nthat reinforce the drive to build more prisons, Davis said.\n\n   As she concluded, Davis urged her listeners to reach out to\nthose inside prisons. A ``go to prison week'' is slated for April\n11-18 as part of a campaign to change U.S. criminal justice and\nprison policies, and she encouraged audience members to visit\npeople they know in prison or arrange prison tours with church or\nschool groups.\n\n   ``I spent a little time in jail, and I definitely do not want to\ngo back, but I will try to get in for at least a few hours,'' Davis\nsaid.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
