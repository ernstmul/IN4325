Clinical researchers noted it all on Post's medical record.\n\n   Despite his state of mind, they asked Post to sign a form\nconsenting to participation in a study involving amphetamine, a\nstimulant known to stir psychotic symptoms in people with mental\nillness.\n\n   When Gregory Aller and Antonio LaMadrid signed up for a\nlong-running schizophrenia study at the University of California,\nLos Angeles, researchers planned to stop their medication,\nexpecting to exacerbate their symptoms or trigger a relapse so more\ncould be learned about the disease. But the consent form said only\nthat the patients ``may improve, worsen, or remain unchanged'' or,\nin a second reference, that ``new symptoms may occur.''\n\n   For at least 25 years, psychiatric researchers at institutions\nacross the United States have asked people under acute mental\nstress to sign forms consenting to experiments that in some cases\nmay drive them deeper into psychosis, that in effect may increase\ntheir pain and suffering. Sometimes, researchers have fudged the\ntrue purpose of their experiments and have glossed over the risks\npatients face.\n\n   Even when the research offered benefits, such as potentially\nbetter medication, some patients have charged they were induced to\ntake part under circumstances that left them feeling pressured or\nduped.\n\n   These episodes, to be sure, represent only a small segment of\nthe broad field of psychiatric research. Hundreds of studies are\nunderway in which doctors and researchers are careful both to\ndisclose the nature of their projects and to prevent harm.\n\n   But researchers conducting some types of studies have conceded\nin court documents that they have not told mentally ill patients\nthe whole truth for fear of frightening them away from enrolling in\nthe experiments.\n\n   Researchers argue that the experiments hold out the potential\nfor future benefits, but critics argue that this does not excuse\nthe failure to adequately disclose the purpose or the risks of\nresearch, or the enrollment of patients who are in a questionable\nstate of mind.\n\n   For patients, the results can be agonizing.\n\n   After a three-month amphetamine ``challenge'' and\nmedication-withdrawal study, Neil Post oscillated between catatonia\nand belligerence.\n\n   Gregory Aller became psychotic during an 18-month withdrawal\nstudy.\n\n   Antonio LaMadrid committed suicide in 1991, three years after\nhis participation in the withdrawal phase of the UCLA study had\nended, but while he was still part of the study follow-up.\n\n   Despite a quarter-century of efforts to protect the mentally ill\nand efforts by psychiatrists to address persistent ethical\nconcerns, some of these tests continue, and the issue of consent\nsmolders. Medical watchdogs are especially concerned about studies\nthat offer no possible therapeutic benefits, such as experiments\nthat deliberately provoke pyschotic symptoms.\n\n   ``Why would anyone agree to be in these studies? If you were\nreally well-informed and you really knew what was going on, could\nyou possibly say yes?'' asked Leonard Glantz, a professor of health\nlaw at Boston University School of Public Health. ``You don't make\npsychotic people psychotic. You don't put diabetic people into\nshock. You don't give people with heart disease heart attacks. It's\nnot an appropriate use of human beings.''\n\n   Glantz served as a consultant to a 1970s commission that called\nfor special research protections for the mentally ill. The\ncommission's proposals were never implemented because of opposition\nfrom psychiatric researchers and bureaucratic inertia. But Glantz\nremains convinced that no one _ mentally ill or not _ should be\nasked to consent to psychosis-inducing experiments.\n\n   At least four facilities in three states are still conducting\nthe symptom-exacerbation studies that raise disturbing questions\nabout patients' consent. Among the Globe's findings:\n\n   _During the last two decades, researchers used patient consent\nforms that failed to fully disclose the risks or purpose of studies\nat the National Institute of Mental Health, UCLA, the University of\nMaryland, and Veterans Affairs hospitals, according to a comparison\nof consent forms with medical protocols and published studies.\nMedical ethicists who reviewed the Globe's findings say the consent\nforms raise serious ethical concerns.\n\n   _During this same period, psychiatric researchers have been\nfound in violation of federal regulations requiring them to obtain\nproper consent for psychiatric research at UCLA, the University of\nMaryland, and the National Institute of Mental Health. UCLA changed\nits consent process in response to a 1994 investigation, while\nMaryland and NIMH changed their processes in response to\ninvestigations this year.\n\n   The federal Office for Protection from Research Risks, which is\npart of the National Institutes of Health, has ongoing\ninvestigations into research at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical\nCenter, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and the University of\nCincinnati.\n\n   _A committee reviewing research practices declared that some\nconsent forms for psychiatric studies are on the verge of being\n``ethically unacceptable'' for failing to adequately describe the\nrisks of medication withdrawal.
