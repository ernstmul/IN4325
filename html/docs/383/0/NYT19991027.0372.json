Times News Service    \n\n   International health officials and scientific experts say that\nstrains of tuberculosis resistant to various drugs are spreading\nfaster than anticipated overseas and that a new treatment strategy\nis needed to prevent what has already become an epidemic from\nspinning out of control.\n\n   For five years, the World Health Organization has recommended\nthat patients with ordinary tuberculosis take up to four drugs,\nevery day, for six to eight months, and that doctors and health\nworkers watch them take their medicine and monitor them to ensure\nthat they are cured. The strategy has become widely known as DOTS,\nor Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course.\n\n   But in a new report, doctors from the Harvard Medical School and\nthe Open Society Institute, a foundation financed by George Soros,\nsay more intensive treatment is needed in the former Soviet Union\nand other areas where rates of TB are relatively high.\n\n   In the intensive regimen, patients are required to take many\nmore expensive drugs, over a longer period of time.\nMultidrug-resistant TB strains afflict on average 2 percent of\nvictims, and nowhere more than 30 percent of them.\n\n   The recommendation has been endorsed by the World Health\nOrganization, whose director general, Gro Harlem Bruntland, is\nscheduled to be present Thursday when the 408-page report is made\npublic in New York.\n\n   But some health experts fear that new approach could make the\nsituation worse.\n\n   In the new treatment strategy, called DOTS-Plus, doctors watch\npatients take up to seven drugs daily, for 18 to 24 months, at far\ngreater cost per cure.\n\n   ``This is a landmark shift by the WHO, the most exciting step\nforward in the global effort to control TB in 25 years,'' said\nMichael D. Iseman, director of TB services at the National Jewish\nMedical and Research Center in Denver, a leading expert in TB\ntreatment and research and a member of the advisory board of the\nHarvard group which wrote the report.\n\n   The report, ``The Global Impact of Drug-Resistant\nTuberculosis,'' contains a foreward offering an unusual endorsement\nfrom the WHO's leading specialists of the new treatment strategy.\n``In our zeal to implement DOTS everywhere,'' said Mario C.\nRaviglione, the WHO's coordinator for bacterial and viral diseases,\nwho signed the preface, ``there was no clear policy in the program\nto take care of multidrug-resistant TB. Now we realize that\nsomething more must be done.''\n\n   Raviglione said he does not know how much more the new treatment\nstrategy would cost since his world health group is only starting\nto study the issue. But he conceded that the expanded strategy will\nalmost certainly cost hundreds of millions of dollars, ``perhaps a\nbillion dollars more'' than the currently recommended treatment,\nwhich is already underfunded, many doctors complain.\n\n   In interviews, several experts said that the WHO's\nrecommendations were likely to intensify an already emotional\npublic health debate about the wisdom of expanding recommended\ntreatment for some TB patients at a time when two million people\nthroughout the world die each year for lack of adequate care.\n\n   At a meeting September in Madrid, Spain, opponents of the\nexpanded strategy argued that emphasizing the treatment, would\nshift desperately needed public health resources away from curing\npatients with nondrug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n   ``The WHO declared TB a global emergency in 1993,'' said Thomas\nR. Frieden, the WHO medical officer for TB for Southeast Asia, in a\ntelephone interview in New Delhi. ``But six years later fewer than\n20 percent of patients get even basic treatment.''\n\n   Frieden said efforts to combat multidrug-resistant TB should\nfocus on its cause, inadequate treatment of ordinary TB.\n\n   Tuberculosis is known to acquire resistance to drugs that are\nbeing given patients inefficiently. If the wrong drugs or doses are\ngiven for too short a time, or if the patients stop taking them,\nthe TB bacteria that survive may become resistant to the drugs.\nFrieden and other experts fear that if new, more highly effective\ndrugs are also given inappropriately, the multidrug-resistant TB\nstrains will eventually become unresponsive to these drugs too,\nmaking an already bad situation worse.\n\n   Paul E. Farmer, director of the Program in Infectious Disease\nand Social Change at Harvard Medical School, the report's primary\nauthor agreed that poor treatment has led to many cases of\nmultidrug-resistant TB. But he said inadequate treatment was no\nlonger the only cause of such strains. He said new data suggest\nthat in some areas drug-resistant strains are now spreading on\ntheir own, person-to-person, even in countries with good TB control\nprograms.\n\n   He said multidrug-resistant tuberculosis now threatens not just\npoorer countries, but Europe and, eventually, the United States as\nwell.\n\n   The study concludes that multidrug-resistant TB has now been\nreported in 100 countries and that its rates are rising faster in\nsome countries than public health officials anticipated.\n\n   For instance, in Russia's Ivanovo region, a poor province with a\nvast prison population and shoddy public health, the WHO reported\nin 1997 that 4 percent of TB patients had multidrug-resistant\nstrains. According to the new report, such cases now total 8.9\npercent of people with TB.\n\n   ``Figures like these show that multidrug-resistant TB in some\nplaces is now out of control, and it shows we were doing something\nwrong, that more than DOTS is needed in such areas,'' said\nRaviglione.\n\n   But Frieden, who was New York's TB control director between 1992\nand 1996, points out that two-thirds of people with\nmultidrug-resistant TB developed it because the Ivanovo province\nprogram did not ensure that patients' took their medication. ``If\nmedicines aren't being taken, it doesn't matter if you're being\ngiven two or four or seven drugs,'' he warned. ``And if resistance\nto reserve drugs emerges, our last line of defense against TB will\nbe lost.''\n\n   Farmer agreed that failure to take drugs was still a major\nproblem in Russia and elsewhere. But, he added, the Ivanovo study\nhad also shown that ``the drugs patients received were\ninadequate,'' which is primarily why only 5 percent of\nmultidrug-resistant cases were cured.\n\n   Raviglione said adoption of a DOTS-plus strategy would not mean\nthe WHO would abandon its current DOTS strategy. In fact, both\nstressed the need to ensure that doctors everywhere make sure\npatients take their drugs. Rather, they said, the report stresses\nthe need for supplemental drugs and therapy where\nmultidrug-resistant strains already exist.\n\n   nn\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)\n\n   Farmer said that his medical team began to question the\ncurrently recommended therapy about five years ago after a relief\nworker colleague died in a Massachusetts hospital after contracting\ndrug resistant TB in Peru, which has an excellent DOTS treatment\nprogram.\n\n   ``That made us think that the one-size fits all treatment\napproach was not universally effective,'' Farmer explained.\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)\n\n   Ideally, the scientists agreed, there would be no competition\nbetween resources for treating nondrug-resistant and drug-resistant\nTB. But given world's indifferent response to the threat, said Lee\nB. Reichman, executive director of the National Tuberculosis Center\nin Newark, N.J., some doctors feared there would be.\n\n   ``Dots-Plus is a sexy new strategy with Harvard behind it, and\nlike any sexy new strategy, there is some fear of it,'' said\nReichman, who contributed to the report. ``But I'm on the WHO's TB\nworking group, and we've made it clear that won't happen.''\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)\n\n   The Harvard study shows that multidrug-resistant TB emerged in\nPeru, despite the fact that it had an excellent control program. In\nPeru, Farmer and his colleagues were able to cure 85 percent of\nsupposedly incurable multidrug-resistant patients by giving them up\nto seven drugs over 24 months. The treatment cost between $280 to\n$4,900, higher than the cost of the currently recommended therapy,\nbut far less than what such treatment would cost in the United\nStates.\n\n   Reichman estimates that it costs his center in Newark, N.J., an\naverage of $4,800 per patient and six months to cure normal TB\nwithout hospitalization, as opposed to $200,000 and up to two years\nof treatment, including lengthy hospitalization, to cure patients\nwith multidrug-resistant strains. In New York City in the early\n1990s, an outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB cost up to $1 billion\nin extra health care costs, said Reichman.\n\n   Because New York and other major cities have bolstered TB\nsurveillance, treatment and control, rates of multidrug-resistant\nTB cases have recently been declining in the United States. In\n1998, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, only 1.1 percent of American TB cases were\nmultidrug-resistant.\n\n   ``The situation overseas has grown far more dangerous,'' said\nAlex Goldfarb, a microbiologist at the Public Health Research\nInstitute, a private health group in New York and a co-author of\nthe report. ``Because there are ever more drug-resistant TB cases\nin hot zones, ``each case is a walking time bomb.''\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)\n\n   In one of its many ominous predictions, the study warns that\neven if the recommended DOTS treatment strategy is implemented, 171\nmillion new cases and 60 million deaths can be expected between\n1998 and 2030.
