Times News Service   \n\n   Shouldn't people with mental illnesses, which can destroy lives\nand families, be entitled to the same amount of insurance coverage\nas those with physical illnesses? On the face of it, that sounds\nlike a fairly simple question.\n\n   But as in all things having to do with health care, and\nespecially the often vaguely defined area of mental illness, the\nissue can be maddeningly complicated.\n\n   Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president, will open a White\nHouse conference on Monday to draft new health-care policies that\nwould require employers and insurers to provide coverage for\noutpatient and inpatient mental health comparable to that for other\nkinds of medical care _ ``parity for all,'' in the words of Mrs.\nGore.\n\n   Along with similar proposals pending in Congress, the White\nHouse initiative would face head-on what Mrs. Gore, who has a\nmaster's degree in psychology, calls the destructive myth that\nthose seeking greater mental health coverage are ``out to rip off\nthe system.''\n\n   At stake is a significant slice of the total U.S. health-care\nbudget. About $80 billion _ nearly 10 percent of total annual\nhealth-care spending _ now goes into mental-health treatment,\naccording to the Center for Mental Health Services, a federal\nresearch agency.\n\n   About a third of that amount, mostly from Medicaid, Medicare and\nother government sources, pays for clinical treatment of the\nseverely mentally ill, whose illnesses often render them poor and\nunemployed and who often ``end up in the public system,'' according\nto Mary Rappaport, a spokeswoman for the National Alliance for the\nMentally Ill, an advocacy group for the severely mentally ill.\n\n   In any year, according to the group, about 5 million Americans\nsuffer from severe and persistent mental disorders, including\nschizophrenia, bipolar disorders and major depression.\n\n   Few seriously question the need for clinical treatment for those\nwith the worst mental illnesses, about 250,000 of whom are\nhomeless. So the debate over the potential cost of providing\ncomparable insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses is\nfocused on those whose treatment consumes the remaining two-thirds\nof the $80 billion total, most of which is paid by\nemployer-provided health insurance.\n\n   This segment includes the ``worried well,'' as they are called\nby those who question the employment of psychiatric therapy to\naddress many less severe emotional distresses and addiction\nproblems. For the past 25 years, most of the increases in\nmental-health spending have gone to this group of patients, who are\nthe easiest and most profitable to treat.\n\n   Proposed federal laws to establish comparable insurance coverage\nfor mental illness seek to give priority to the severely ill. But\nsome employers and policy analysts worry that once mandates for\nexpanded mental-health coverage are in place, costs could rise\nsharply above the modest levels projected by the drafters of the\nparity bills. The concern is that the legislation would provide\nprofit incentives to tailor diagnoses and to recruit new pools of\npatients.\n\n   Advocates of comparable insurance coverage cite studies showing\nthat the additional cost would be minimal, while providing a major\npublic-health benefit. The National Institute of Mental Health\npredicts that mandating parity through managed-care plans would add\nless than 1 percent to the total annual national health-care bill.\n\n   But such studies could be flawed by ``very low assumptions on\ninduced demand,'' said Paul Fronstin, a senior researcher at the\nEmployee Benefit Research Institute, whose clients include\nemployers, labor unions and pension plans. ``Induced demand''\nrefers to marketing by the mental-health industry, usually among\npatients with health insurance who can be successfully treated for\na wide array of mental disorders defined in the American\nPsychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.\n\n   For employers and others worried about potential cost increases\nin mental-health therapy, induced demand raises a red flag. In the\nlate 1980s, when expanded psychiatric and substance-abuse therapy\nwas heavily promoted and advertised among the general population,\nannual costs for such treatments rose 20 percent to 30 percent\nfaster than costs in other areas of health care, employers found.\n\n   Fraud also became a problem. In the early 1990s, for-profit\npsychiatric hospitals and addiction centers paid over $500 million\nin federal fines to settle charges of profiteering and diagnostic\nfraud in recruiting patients with generous mental-health insurance.\nMany health-maintenance organizations responded by tightening\nbenefits for inpatient hospitalization and other mental-health\ntreatment.\n\n   For their part, advocates for comparable insurance coverage cite\nevidence that they say shows that more money is needed for\nadditional mental-health treatment:\n\n   _ In any year 30 million Americans suffer from clinical mental\ndisorders, but only about 20 percent currently seek treatment,\naccording to studies cited by the National Institute of Mental\nHealth.\n\n   _ According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 11.3\npercent of Americans will at some point require psychiatric\ntreatment for various addictions. In an April report, the group\ncalled for more spending on addiction therapy.\n\n   _ The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched a\nnational television and radio advertising campaign to encourage\nmore people to seek treatment for anxiety disorders, which the\nagency describes as ``frightening mental illnesses'' affecting 19\nmillion Americans.\n\n   _ The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill cites studies\nasserting that of the nation's 63 million youths under 18, about\n7.5 million have diagnosable mental disorders _ but only about a\nfifth now receive treatment.\n\n   _ Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is prompted by memories\nof traumatic events, is now widely diagnosed among victims and\nwitnesses of crimes, natural disasters and even marital problems.\nThe National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 4 percent of\nthe population suffers from it. But that number could grow.
