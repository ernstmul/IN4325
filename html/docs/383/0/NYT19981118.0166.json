Lehman, principal\ninvestigator for the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team\n(PORT) study, which discovered glaring disparities between what's\nknown about the disease and what's provided to patients.\n\n   ``Most patients don't get an adequate treatment package,'' said\nLehman, a University of Maryland professor of psychiatry. ``I think\nthat outcomes could be better, and people could have a better\nquality of life within the limits of what we already know. There's\nplenty of room for improvement for many patients.''\n\n   On average, hospital and outpatient clinicians failed to provide\neffective treatment approaches more than 50 percent of the time,\naccording to the study that analyzed in depth the care provided to\nmore than 700 patients in two states, one in the South and one in\nthe Midwest. While the study did not name the states, to protect\nconfidentiality, Georgia has disclosed its participation.\n\n   Schizophrenia, which was first described more than 100 years ago\nand is characterized by such symptoms as hallucinations, delusions,\nand emotional withdrawal, affects up to 2 million Americans. Some\npatients become chronically ill; others experience a single\npsychotic episode and recover. The disorder usually manifests\nitself in adolescence or early adulthood.\n\n   Last month, in response to the PORT study, the National Alliance\nfor the Mentally Ill, a Virginia-based advocacy group, launched an\ninitiative to get every state to adopt, by the year 2002, a major\nrecommendation      set forth by the study _ the so-called Program for\nAssertive Community Treatment, or PACT.\n\n   The PACT program includes intense psychiatric, social work,\nnursing, and vocational rehabilitation services to keep those\npeople at greater risk of serious illness from being hospitalized,\nbecoming homeless, or of going to prison. The study found that only\n10.1 percent of outpatients in the two states examined received\nsuch treatment.\n\n   The PACT concept is based on a program that began 25 years ago\nin Madison, Wis. It now is offered statewide in Delaware, Idaho,\nMichigan, RhodeIsland, Texas, and Wisconsin, and pilot programs are\nunder way in California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Virginia, and\nMassachusetts.\n\n   The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health has taken all the\nstudy's recommendations to heart and expanded upon them.\n\n   It plans to require mental health providers doing business with\nthe state to follow the recommendations on medication use,\npsychosocial services, and the other aspects of treatment.\n\n   ``It's a pretty extensive mandate, if you will,'' said Dr. Paul\nBarreira, deputy commissioner for clinical and professional\nservices. ``It's a way to standardize the treatments, so treatments\nknown to be effective are being used.''\n\n   The department expects to wrap up consultations with providers,\npatients, and families on the recommendations by the end of the\nyear, said Barreira, and then it will make copies of the report\nreadily available.\n\n   ``We want this to be a common document that patients and\nfamilies and clinicians can use to talk about where the treatment's\nat,'' Barreira said.\n\n   Other treatment approaches the PORT study found to be underused\ninclude antipsychotic medication for new or relapsed patients,\ndrugs to combat the depression that some patients experience,\npsychotherapy, and family education and support.\n\n   Family education and support are most lacking, the study found;\nonly 9.6 percent of patients and their families getting such\nservices. That kind of support has been shown to reduce relapse\nrates by 50 to 75 percent, especially when used in conjunction with\nmedication.\n\n   ``This is a simple kind of thing. When someone comes into the\nhospital and is first diagnosed with schizophrenia, there should be\na systematic way to educate the family about what's going on,''\nsaid William Hargreaves, a professor of psychology at the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco. ``It's something we ought\nto be able to do on a large scale nationally.''\n\n   The study's recommendations on medication use were generally\nbetter followed than those for psychosocial services. Yet more than\n10 percent of hospitalized patients in the study did not receive\nantipsychotic drugs, and more than 70 percent of outpatients did\nnot get the appropriate dose of drugs over the long term.\n\n   The findings show ``what a chasm'' exists between what is\npossible and what is being done, said Gerard Hogarty, a professor\nof psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who has done studies\non the effectiveness of family education and other psychosocial\nservices in treating people with schizophrenia.\n\n   The PORT study is not the first to point out that with the use\nof available treatment options many people with schizophrenia can\nlead productive lives.\n\n   Yet a societal misperception that people with schizophrenia are\nviolent or beyond help continues to make difficult efforts to\nexpand the availability of treatments, say some mental health\nprofessionals and advocates.\n\n   The recent headlines about the Capitol Hill gunman and a Yale\nlaw student who killed his girlfriend add to that misperception,\neven though a study earlier this year found that people with\nschizophrenia who were not also substance abusers are no more\nlikely to be violent than anyone else.\n\n   ``That myth or misconception that people do not recover affects\nall research, all treatment, all funding,'' said Dr. Daniel B.\nFisher, a community-based psychiatrist who was diagnosed with\nschizophrenia 30 years ago. He is executive director of the\nNational Empowerment Center, a federally funded mental health\nadvocacy group in Lawrence.\n\n   In a recent article in Behavioral Healthcare Tomorrow magazine,\nFisher identified factors that have helped people with\nschizophrenia to recover.\n\n   Key among the findings from his federally funded study: A strong\nsocial support network, and the financial resources to help the\npatient get through periods when he or she is unable to work.\n\n   Also hindering the expansion of psychosocial services, in\nparticular, is the prevailing belief that the answer to\nschizophrenia lies in a drug yet to be discovered, or a\nneurobiological secret yet to be unlocked, say some mental health\nprofessionals and advocates.\n\n   Research funding is ``very lopsided in favor of neurobiology,''\nsaid Hogarty, who is a social worker by training.\n\n   ``There's clearly not equity in this.
