Some of them _\ninfants and toddlers _ won't eat. Others, usually adolescents, are\nviolent. But Fisher has found a therapy, called applied behavior\nanalysis, that works well for both groups.\n\n   It takes about the same length of time. It costs the same. And,\nmost importantly, it has about the same success rate _ around 80\npercent, Fisher said.\n\n   But when the bills are submitted to health insurance companies,\nthe similarities end. While insurers accept the cost of the\ninfants' care in about 90 percent of cases, they approve the price\nof the adolescents' care only about 20 percent of the time, Fisher\nsaid.\n\n   Why? Because the adolescents' problems fall into the murky realm\nof mental illness, a field of medicine where routine discrimination\nis condoned and defended.\n\n   ``Our hope is that as people become more aware of the situation,\nfamilies who have a mentally ill member can push harder to get the\nservices they need,'' Fisher said.\n\n   Advocates for the mentally ill say that, while the U.S. surgeon\ngeneral's report issued Monday is a step in the right direction,\nit's unlikely to change the daily hassles faced by one in four\nAmerican families every year when members need mental health care.\n\n   ``You can't imagine how frustrating it is to deal with the\nfinancial and insurance end of things,'' said Suzanne Broder, whose\n36-year-old son, Chris Byrd, is diagnosed with schizo-affective\ndisorder. ``It's an extremely unfair situation.''\n\n   That's because most employers and insurers still don't offer\nequal benefits, or ``parity,'' when it comes to mental illness.\nAlthough a person might have a $1 million lifetime benefit for\nmedical bills such as heart surgery or leukemia treatment, it's\nrare that he or she would have such a benefit for schizophrenia.\n\n   Byrd, for example, held private insurance for more than a\ndecade, but he had no outpatient mental health benefits and a\n$10,000 lifetime cap on inpatient services. That was exceeded\nduring his first hospitalization and, since then, his family has\nspent at least another $10,000 on unreimbursed services.\n\n   The federal government has tried to rectify the problem, with\nthe passage of the Mental Health Parity Act. And 26 states,\nincluding Georgia, have put parity laws on the books. But the\nbottom line is that all these laws, often hard-won in legislative\nbattles, are narrow in focus and don't mandate much. Most require\nonly that employers already offering mental health benefits be sure\nthe benefits are equal to traditional medical policies. And, in a\ncontinuing problem for health consumers, the state laws don't\naffect the almost 40 percent of workers who are employed by\ncompanies that are self-insured. Those businesses, often large\ncorporations, are exempt from state mandates under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\n   ``We haven't made much progress in this area,'' said Lei\nEllingson, assistant director of the Carter Center's mental health\nprogram. ``Although we are finally getting some data to debunk the\ntheory that (parity) would be astronomically expensive.''\n\n   Insurers and employers have maintained for years that adding\nmental health mandates would be too costly. The Health Insurance\nAssociation of America has reported that any mental health mandates\nwould bring dramatic hikes in premiums and a 6 percent increase in\nthe number of uninsured, because many employers would stop offering\nhealth insurance.\n\n   But other studies, including a 1997 report in The Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association, have concluded that insurance\nmandates would increase the number of uninsured by only 0.04\npercent and suggested that the cost of mental health benefits has\nactually been declining.\n\n   That's partly because many workers are still hesitant to take\nadvantage of mental health benefits through employers, out of\nconcern that their bosses will find out.\n\n   ``People are still worried about confidentiality,'' said Pamela\nGreensberg, executive director of the American Managed Behavioral\nHealthcare Association. ``I think Congress needs to enact\nregulations protecting medical records so everyone can feel a\nlittle more comfortable getting the services they need.''\n\n   But, for now, families and the doctors and other therapists who\ntreat them have to fend for themselves. And experts on all sides\nrecommend that people comb through their health insurance policies\nto find the fairest deal they can in an unfair world. For example:\n\n      Check out the co-payments and deductibles. If you discover\nthat you have a $500 deductible for mental health care and a $100\ndeductible for traditional medical treatment, you probably should\nseek out another health care plan. And if your insurance is\nemployer-based, you should find out whether it complies with parity\nlaws.\n\n      Make sure you can choose the provider you want, rather than be\nforced to pick a doctor or therapist from a list. And make sure the\ninsurer offers a range of mental health providers, such as\npsychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.\n\n      Understand the kind of provider you need. If you rely on\nmedications, you'll probably need regular contact with a\npsychiatrist, who can prescribe drugs. On the other hand, if you're\ndealing with grief, a divorce or other issues that don't require\nmedicine, a social worker or psychologist might be the most\nappropriate provider.\n\n      If you're having problems with your insurance coverage, call\nthe Georgia Mental Health Insurance Advocacy Center Hotline\n(404-978-0316 in metro Atlanta, 1-800-933-9896 elsewhere) or\ncontact the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Georgia\n(770-234-0855 or\n\n   e-mail to NAMI-GA(at)nami.org).\n\n   Diane Lore writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   Wayne Fisher, director of the Marcus Behavior Center in Atlanta,\ntreats youngsters with severe behavioral problems.
