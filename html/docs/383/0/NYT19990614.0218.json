SMITH \nc.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram \n\n   While growing up in a small town in Northeast Texas, I had one\npersistent fear: that my mother would do something outrageous to\nembarrass me.\n\n   This fear was justified with devastating regularity.\n\n   There was the time, for example, that I was playing touch\nfootball with friends in my front yard. A stranger from out of town\nstopped to ask for directions. For no apparent reason, my mother\nstormed out of the house and cussed a blue streak at the man. I\nstood there, red-faced and petrified, as my friends watched with\nmouths agape.\n\n   Some of my most terrifying moments came when my mother was\ndriving our Plymouth sedan and suddenly went into her A.J. Foyt\nmode. When angered by something, and that was often, she could\ninstantly transform a 30 mph residential street into an 80 mph\nautobahn.\n\n   When in such a rage, she might pull up beside another car at a\nstoplight, glare at its occupants and repeatedly honk her horn in a\nmenacing fashion. Some cowed individuals literally ran a red light\nto escape her. I would bow my head in shame, waiting for my\nmother's inexplicable fit to subside. Her local nickname was\n``Runnin' Mary.''\n\n   At home, my mother spent much of her time sitting, staring\ndetachedly into space and slowly puffing a cigarette. She often\ncomplained incoherently that our home was plagued by people trying\nto ``line in'' controlling thoughts through telephone wires.\n\n   My mother, Mary Elizabeth Swint Smith _ whose initials\nironically spelled ``M.E.S.S.'' _ was classified by the doctors as\n``paranoid schizophrenic.''\n\n   I can remember, with great sadness, visiting her in the stark\nsetting of a state mental hospital when I was in the fifth grade.\nYears later, tears would stream down my cheeks as I watched movies\nsuch as ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' or ``A Woman Under the\nInfluence,'' films that vividly depicted the tragedy of mental\nillness.\n\n   So it was with no small pleasure that I read this past week how\nPresident Clinton and Tipper Gore hosted a White House conference\nat which they outlined various initiatives to help the mentally\nill.\n\n   Clinton notified the 285 health plans used by federal employees\nthat they must provide the same degree of insurance coverage for\nmental illness and substance abuse as for other health problems. He\nurged other employers to provide similar coverage.\n\n   Many insurance plans provide more limited coverage for mental\nillnesses than other health problems. And many people lack health\ninsurance or are reluctant to seek professional help because of the\nstigma associated with mental illness. That helps explain why many\nmentally ill people populate our homeless shelters and jails.\n\n   There are staggering public misperceptions about mental illness.\nThese illnesses are not caused by weaknesses in personality or an\ninadequate upbringing, as some believe. Mental illnesses such as\nschizophrenia and severe depression are caused by defects in the\nway chemicals transmit messages within the brain.\n\n   Most mentally ill people can benefit greatly from medication and\npsychotherapy. Many, provided with such help, hold jobs and lead\nnear-normal lives.\n\n   Dr. Peggy Bailey, a psychologist and board president of the\nMental Health Association of Tarrant County, Texas, says more\nunderstanding is needed to foster public support for the mentally\nill.\n\n   ``Our response to a woman who has been diagnosed with breast\ncancer is profound and comforting and deeply sympathetic,'' she\nsaid. ``We don't find, for the mentally ill or for their families,\nthat type of response when there is a diagnosis of mental illness.\nI think that would make a huge difference.''\n\n   Bailey said Clinton's call for more parity in insurance coverage\nfor mental illness is ``wonderful.'' Access to good medical care is\n``critical,'' she said.\n\n   Mental illness can destroy families. My mother's schizophrenia\ncontributed mightily to my parents' divorce when I was in junior\nhigh. It crushed me when my dad remarried and moved to another\ntown. My mother was unemployable. My two brothers and I suffered\njolting financial and emotional hardships in my high school years.\n\n   For most of my mother's adult life, she refused to take\nmedication that would have helped her (like many schizophrenics,\nshe was convinced that nothing was wrong with her). For 17 years, I\nwas her legal guardian, coping with some incredibly trying\nsituations as she continued declining mentally and physically.\n\n   In the twilight of her life, we finally coaxed her into moving\n150 miles from our hometown, Mount Pleasant, to an excellent\nnursing home in Fort Worth.\n\n   She began taking medication, ate better and regularly visited\nme, my wife and our two daughters. I recall her happily tapping her\nfeet to Frank Sinatra tapes I bought her and chatting with my\ndaughters, whom she came to greatly love. In that period before her\ndeath in 1993, her true nature _ that of a gentle and incredibly\nkind human being _ revealed itself as never before.\n\n   In her early years, my mother was an attractive and bright young\nwoman, a Baylor University graduate who enjoyed good books and\nloved the Big Band music of her generation. Then the curse of\nschizophrenia struck in her late 20s. She would never be the same.\n\n   If family members and others had better understood her\ncondition, and if she had received better medical care, she could\nhave coped far, far better with the illness. Her life didn't have\nto be the tragedy that it became.\n\n   That's just as true today for the millions of Americans who\nsuffer from mental illness, many of whom are not receiving the full\nhelp and understanding that they so desperately need.\n\n   (Jack Z.
