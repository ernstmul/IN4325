Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ One in every five Americans experiences a mental\ndisorder in any given year, and half of all Americans have such\ndisorders at some time in their lives, but most of them never seek\ntreatment, the surgeon general of the United States says in a\ncomprehensive new report.\n\n   Many people with mental disorders do not realize that effective\ntreatments exist, or they fear discrimination because of the stigma\nattached to mental illness, the study found. And, it said, many\npeople cannot afford treatment because they lack insurance that\nwould cover it.\n\n   After reviewing hundreds of studies, the report concludes that\n``a range of effective treatments exist for nearly all mental\ndisorders,'' including the most severe. The report's principal\nrecommendation is to ``seek help if you experience symptoms of\nmental illness.''\n\n   The report is to be issued at the White House on Monday by the\nsurgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, the government's leading\nspokesman on matters of public health.\n\n   Satcher's report finds a huge gap between the need for mental\nhealth services and their availability.\n\n   One of the report's major themes is that mental health must be\npart of mainstream health care, not an afterthought or an offshoot.\n\n   The report says that ``22 percent of the population has a\ndiagnosable mental disorder,'' and that ``mental illness, including\nsuicide, is the second leading cause of disability,'' after heart\ndisease.\n\n   But, it says, ``nearly two-thirds of all people with diagnosable\nmental disorders do not seek treatment.''\n\n   The statistics, derived from studies published in the last few\nyears, will probably not surprise psychiatrists, psychologists or\nother specialists in mental health. But the report is significant\nbecause it meticulously analyzes huge amounts of data and puts the\nimprimatur of the government on the findings, just as the surgeon\ngeneral's report on smoking and health did in 1964.\n\n   Mental disorders are defined in the report as health conditions\nmarked by alterations in thinking, mood or behavior that cause\ndistress or impair a person's ability to function. They include\nAlzheimer's disease, depression, attention-deficit or hyperactivity\ndisorder and phobias.\n\n   The report says people are deterred from seeking treatment for\nmental disorders because they have no health insurance, their\ninsurance does not adequately cover the costs or they have an\n``unwarranted sense of hopelessness'' about the prospects for\nrecovery from mental illness.\n\n   The document declares that ``mental disorders are not character\nflaws, but are legitimate illnesses that respond to specific\ntreatments.'' It says that the ``cruel and unfair stigma attached\nto mental illness'' is ``inexcusably outmoded'' and must no longer\nbe tolerated.\n\n   ``Why is the stigma so strong despite better public\nunderstanding of mental illness?'' the report asks. ``The answer\nappears to be fear of violence. People with mental illness,\nespecially those with psychosis, are perceived to be more violent\nthan in the past.''\n\n   While research suggests that some people with mental disorders\nand drug abuse problems do indeed pose a risk of violence, the\nreport says, the danger is not great. ``In fact,'' it says, ``there\nis very little risk of violence or harm to a stranger from casual\ncontact with an individual who has a mental disorder.''\n\n   In issuing the report, federal officials said, the Clinton\nadministration will emphasize its efforts to fight mental illness.\n\n   Copies of the report and related documents were obtained Sunday\nfrom three sources: a civil servant who fears that the scientific\nsignificance of the report may be overshadowed by its ``political\nmanipulation,'' consumer advocates who advised the government on\nthe study and mental health experts close to the office of Tipper\nGore. Over the last two decades, Mrs. Gore, the wife of Vice\nPresident Al Gore, has been a champion for the rights of people\nwith mental illness, and she was once treated for depression\nherself..\n\n   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, who served as a member of the planning board for the\nreport, said: ``This is a historic day. It's wonderful that we have\na surgeon general talking about mental health and mental illness,\nin a voice that has not been used in Washington before.''\n\n   Faenza said the report could be a turning point, if it improved\naccess to services, or ``it could be meaningless, if Congress and\nstate legislators do not have the backbone and the political will\nto act on it.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The report endorses efforts by some states and members of\nCongress to eliminate the disparities in insurance coverage for\nmental disorders and other illnesses. Equality between mental\nhealth coverage and insurance for other illnesses _ a concept known\nas parity _ is ``an affordable and effective objective,'' it says.\nWhen mental health care is properly coordinated by a health\nmaintenance organization or a firm specializing in such care,\nparity causes ``negligible cost increases,'' it says.\n\n   But, the study says, techniques used by HMOs to cut costs, by\nreducing hospital stays and encouraging short-term outpatient\ntherapy, have not worked well for emotionally disturbed children\nfrom low-income families on Medicaid. Indeed, it says, Medicaid may\nbe simply shifting costs to child welfare and juvenile justice\nagencies.\n\n   Among other recommendations, the study says ``it is imperative\nto expand the supply'' of mental health services, and to increase\nthe number of mental health professionals caring for children and\nadolescents. The study does not specify the cost of such\ninitiatives, but health officials said the administration was not\nseeking a big budget increase.\n\n   Researchers have made immense gains in the treatment of mental\ndisorders, with powerful new drugs and various methods of\npsychotherapy, but they need to focus more on how to prevent such\nillnesses, the report said.\n\n   Progress in preventing mental illness has been slow, because\nscientists do not understand enough about the causes of such\nillness, the report said. Mental disorders are usually not defined\nby laboratory tests or physiologic abnormalities of the brain, and\n``for the most part, their causes remain unknown,'' it said.\n\n   The split between mind and body, proposed by Descartes in the\n17th century, is artificial and antiquated and has hampered mental\nhealth research, the report says.\n\n   ``The roots of most mental disorders lie in some combination of\nbiological and environmental factors,'' the report says. ``No\nsingle gene appears to be responsible for any mental disorder.\nRather, small variations in multiple genes contribute to a\ndisruption in healthy brain function.'' Under certain environmental\nconditions, it says, this disruption can result in mental illness.\n\n   The report says ``the mental health system is highly\nfragmented,'' so that people who need help must often navigate a\nbewildering maze to get treatment. Moreover, it says, health care\npractitioners are often unaware of research identifying the most\neffective treatments.\n\n   The surgeon general's report also makes these points:\n\n   --Psychiatric disorders appear in all types of families, of all\nsocial classes and of all backgrounds.\n\n   --Treatment of mental disorders cost $69 billion in 1996, the\nlast year for which figures are available. In addition, the nation\nspent $17.7 billion on Alzheimer's disease and $12.6 billion on\ntreatment for drug and alcohol abuse that year. The figures do not\ninclude indirect costs, like days of work lost because of mental\nillness.\n\n   --One in five children experiences the signs and symptoms of a\ndiagnosable mental disorder in the course of a year, but only about\n5 percent of all children suffer ``extreme functional impairment.''\n\n   --Among Americans ages 18 to 54, the report said, 14.9 have\nanxiety disorders, 7.1 percent have mood disorders and 1.3 percent\nhave schizophrenia.\n\n   --Among elderly people, depression takes an ``inordinate toll,''\nbut often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Eight percent to 15\npercent of older people living in the community have symptoms of\ndepression. ``Suicidal thoughts are sometimes considered a normal\nfacet of old age.'' People 65 and older have the highest suicide\nrates of any age group.\n\n   In addition, the report says that Alzheimer's disease strikes 8\npercent to 15 percent of people over the age of 65.
