In many cases, it is\nprosecutors who have discretion to send offenders to treatment,\ninstead of filing charges that could lead to jail time.\n\n   ``Drug courts work,'' said Judge John Schwartz, chief of the\ncity court system in Rochester, N.Y. ``They treat the underlying\ndisease of addiction. Prison does not break the cycle of\naddiction.''\n\n   While critics say the drug courts coddle chronic abusers who\nbelong in jail, the cost savings have won over many others.\nTreatment instead of prison saves about $20,000 per person\nannually, according to a study last year by the National Center on\nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.\n\n   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of national drug policy, has\nbecome a promoter of drug courts, saying they ``constitute one of\nthe most monumental changes in social justice in this country since\nWorld War II.'' After three years as the drug czar, McCaffrey has\nconcluded that treatment is the best way to reduce drug use.\n\n   The Clinton administration has increased financing for treatment\nby 17 percent over the last four years. But President Clinton's\ndrug-fighting budget, at $18 billion, the biggest in history, still\ndirects nearly two-thirds of the money to enforcement and\ninterdiction of the drug supply, a proportion unchanged since the\nReagan administration. Treatment will get about $3 billion from the\nbudget.\n\n   According to the General Accounting Office, the research arm of\nCongress, 70 percent of the people sent to drug courts successfully\ncomplete treatment. People who are sent to prison instead of\ntreatment are four times as likely to commit another drug crime\nwithin five years of release, the report found.\n\n   ``Drug treatment programs are like Madonna _ they keep\nreinventing themselves after everyone has written them off,'' said\nBarbara Zugor, executive director of one of Arizona's oldest\ntreatment centers, the Treatment Assessment Screening Center.\n\n   On Ms. Zugor's office wall are pictures of her with the nation's\ndrug czars through the years, from William Bennett, who advocated\nlocking up casual users, to McCaffrey, who says he has dropped the\nterm ``drug war'' as inappropriate.\n\n   Looking at the pictures, Ms. Zugor said drug policy had\nessentially gone full circle, from the hope of early treatment\nyears to a harsh period of prison-building and zero tolerance to a\ntrend toward treatment but with a coercive element.\n\n   ``For all the money we've spent as a country, we haven't really\nhad a good debate on what works,'' she said. ``I do know this,\nthough: Law enforcement and the courts and prosecutors seem to be\nawfully tired of picking people up and sending them off to jail.''\n\n   THE CHANGE: Another Direction In A Traditional State\n\n   Arizona might seem an odd state to turn the table on American\ndrug policy. Its voters are generally conservative and definitely\nnot soft on crime. For years, the state's imprisonment rate has\nranked among the top. And under the state's basic drug laws, it is\na felony to possess even the smallest amount of drugs like\nmarijuana.\n\n   In the last five years, the prison population has ballooned by\n50 percent, to 26,000. State officials say drug and alcohol abuse\nare at the root of the crimes of about 75 percent of the inmates,\nmatching national surveys.\n\n   Arizona used to proclaim zero tolerance toward drugs, a policy\npublicized with scare commercials showing graphic images of prison\nlife. A tent camp for prisoners _ nicknamed Camp Arpaio, after the\ntough-talking Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio _ was perhaps\nthe most visible symbol of crime and punishment in the Grand Canyon\nstate.\n\n   But in 1996, retired millionaire Joseph Sperling started a\npolitical rockslide that is still sending down stones. Sperling,\nwho is 78 and calls himself a lifetime student of British\nempiricism and economic history, made his fortune by building a\nuniversity system for profit and then taking public the company\nthat ran the system, called Apollo. But he was not ready to retire.\n\n   ``As a social scientist, I thought the drug war was one of the\nmost disastrous public policies I'd ever encountered,'' he said in\nan interview from Vienna, where he was vacationing. ``Three years\nago, I was talking with some Arizona politicians, and I said, `We\nought to reform the drug laws.'''\n\n   Sperling was particularly incensed by how crack had been\ndepicted in the press and by policy-makers as something that turned\npeople into robots or animals.
