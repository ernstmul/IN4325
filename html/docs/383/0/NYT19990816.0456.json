Bush is expected on Tuesday to decide\nthe fate of a mentally ill death row inmate who murdered five\npeople but whose cause is being championed by mental health\nadvocates who say his case illustrates the state's inadequate\nservices for mentally ill people.\n\n   With Bush campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination\nas a ``compassionate conservative,'' the case of Larry Keith\nRobison is attracting attention, particularly in light of comments\nattributed to the governor in a recent magazine interview in which\nhe seemed to mock the clemency pleas of a death row inmate, Karla\nFaye Tucker, who was executed in February 1998.\n\n   The execution by lethal injection of Robison, 42, is scheduled\nfor 6 p.m. Tuesday. He would become the 99th person executed since\nBush took office in January 1995. A total of 184 people have been\nexecuted in Texas since the state amended its criminal code in 1974\nto allow the death penalty. The first execution occurred in 1982.\n\n   The Rev. Melodee Smith, who is also a lawyer and is handling\nRobison's clemency petition, said she filed appeals Monday with\nstate courts that included a request for a delay to allow a state\npsychiatrist to determine Robison's competency.\n\n   ``There is no excuse for the crime,'' Ms. Smith said of the 1982\nkillings in Tarrant County. But she said the state's system for\nserving mentally ill people had failed Robison, who has a history\nof drug abuse and had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic\nseveral years before the killings.\n\n   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said Monday that the\ngovernor had not made a decision in the case. She said that the\nTexas Board of Pardons and Parole voted 17-0 on Friday to deny\ncommutation of Robison's death sentence to life in prison. Without\nsuch a recommendation, Ms. Edwards said that the governor could not\ncommute a death sentence under Texas law. Bush could grant a 30-day\nstay of execution. ``He is carefully considering the facts in the\ncase as he does in all death penalty cases,'' Ms. Edwards said.\n\n   In June 1998, acting at the recommendation of the parole board,\nBush commuted the death sentence of Henry Lee Lucas, who was found\nguilty of several murders in the 1980s but whose conviction in\nTexas had been called into question. In every other case, the\nparole board has recommended death, and Bush has followed the\nrecommendation.\n\n   If Robison is executed, he will become the 21st death row inmate\nin Texas to die this year. In a state where executions have become\nalmost commonplace, four other inmates were executed earlier this\nmonth with little fanfare. But Robison's case has attracted the\nattention of mental health advocates from across the country and a\nplea for mercy from Pope John Paul II.\n\n   The details of Robison's case are particularly gruesome: He was\nconvicted of shooting, stabbing and sexually mutilating five people\nin August 1982, and prosecutors also suggested that he committed\ncannibalism. Prosecutors discounted his assertion of mental\nillness, saying that he acted deliberately and with premeditation.\n\n   ``He may be mentally ill,'' said Greg Pipes, the Tarrant County\nprosecutor who handled the case. ``I'm just saying his mental\nillness did not cause him to commit the crime. He knew what he did\nand why he did it.''\n\n   But advocates for Robison place much of the blame on the state's\nmental health system. His mother, Lois Robison, said she made\nrepeated efforts to get him psychiatric help before the murders.\nShe said she tried unsuccessfully to commit her son to state\nhospitals after he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.\n``They couldn't keep him more than 30 days because he was not\nviolent,'' Ms. Robison said in a telephone interview Monday. ``If\nhe ever got violent then they could keep him on an involuntary\nbasis.''\n\n   Mary Graham, vice president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, a national group of mental health agencies, said that\nTexas ranked 42nd among the 50 states in per resident expenditures\nfor mental health services. Last spring, the state legislature\nallocated an additional $27 million for mental health services, but\nthis month, as state officials discovered the possibility of a $30\nmillion budget shortfall, the Texas Department of Mental Health and\nMental Retardation announced that $5 million would be cut for\nmedications and $2.4 million for state mental hospital beds.\n\n   ``Texas has never adequately funded mental health services _ yet\nit is perfectly willing to execute people for crimes that good\nmental health care might have prevented,'' wrote The Dallas Morning\nNews, in a lead editorial that appeared on Friday.\n\n   Ms. Edwards said state officials were ``working on finding funds\nelsewhere.'' She said that financing for mental health and\nretardation had increased by $670 million while Bush has been in\noffice.\n\n   During the 1992 election, when President Clinton was governor of\nArkansas, he attracted criticism for deciding to proceed with the\nexecution of a brain-damaged felon who had been convicted of a\nkilling a police officer.\n\n   For Bush, the Robison case also has political ramifications. The\ngovernor has faced criticism for his comments in a recent profile\nin Talk magazine in which he was quoted as mocking Karla Faye\nTucker in a whimpering voice.\n\n   Campaign officials for Bush have denied the characterization of\nhis comments, saying that the governor was misread.
