DIIULIO JR. and JOSEPH P. TIERNEY    \n c.2000 New York Times    \n\n   PHILADELPHIA _ America's violent crime rate has fallen by about\na third since 1993, but it could fall further if we took better\ncontrol of the millions of criminals who are on probation rather\nthan in prison or jail.\n\n   A growing body of evidence is showing that the ``broken\nwindows'' strategy used effectively by police departments _ taking\npetty crimes seriously as a way to establish a low tolerance for\nlawbreaking at every level _ can be adapted to the treatment of\npeople on probation. If those who break the conditions of\nprobation, even with what seem like minor lapses, are held\naccountable for it, the public will be safer.\n\n   Although jails and prisons hold nearly two million people, there\nare many more on probation _ and not just for misdemeanors marring\notherwise clean records. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports\nthat in 1999 more than 3.7 million adults were under supervision of\nprobation officers nationwide. Nearly two million of them had been\nconvicted of one or more felony crimes, but sentenced to probation\nfor those crimes, rather than to prison. In many states, about half\nthe people on probation have histories of criminal violence.\n\n   Probation is supposed to help rehabilitate the offender and\nprotect the public. But about 40 percent of all felony probationers\nare rearrested for fresh felonies within three years of being\nplaced under community supervision. Others walk away: in 1990, with\na probation population a third smaller than what we have now,\nprobation agencies had lost track of a quarter-million\n``absconders'' _ people still under sentence but not reporting in.\nBecause record keeping has become so spotty, no one knows how many\nabsconders there are today. Few attempts are made to locate these\nfugitives or to bring them to court.\n\n   Half of all probationers violate the terms of their sentences,\nbut only a fifth go to jail as a result. In 1998, some 255,000\nprobationers were incarcerated for new felony crimes committed\nwhile under supervision, and another 615,000 violated one or more\nterms of their sentences but received no punishment. And though\ncourts routinely make drug treatment a condition of probation\n(since an estimated 80 percent of probationers have serious\nsubstance abuse problems), fewer than 40 percent of all\nprobationers nationwide actually participate in any type of drug\ntreatment during their sentences.\n\n   We spend only about $200 a year per probationer, and we get what\nwe pay for. Strapped for time and overburdened by their caseloads,\nprobation officers too often resort to ``fortress probation,''\nshuffling paperwork and rarely leaving their offices or having\nface-to-face contact with the offenders they supposedly supervise.\nOne recent study found that in 1998 fewer than one in 20 people who\nworked for probation agencies ever actually spent time supervising\nfelony probationers on the streets.\n\n   A lax attitude toward enforcement pervades the system, and\nprobationers have come to expect two or more ``free ones'' when it\ncomes to drugs in urine samples, electronic monitoring violations,\nor failure to comply with a wide variety of conditions. The\nManhattan Institute recently released a report by the Reinventing\nProbation Council, a group of probation officials from across the\ncountry, which argues that the response to violations should be\ngraduated sanctions, like curfews or house arrest, more intensive\nsupervision or monitoring, mandatory drug treatment, a brief period\nof confinement in jail, or placement in a close-watch residential\nfacility. As the report stresses, first-hand knowledge of an\noffender's family and neighborhood are critical elements of\neffective supervision. Probation supervision must cease to be a\n9-to-5 occupation. It must be delivered at nights, on weekends and\non holidays.\n\n   Such reforms will not be easy. Adult probation caseloads have\nsoared to more than 500 per officer in many cities. Some 60 percent\nof Los Angeles probationers, for example, are tracked solely by\ncomputer. Many probation agencies, adult and juvenile, lack even\nbasic data like addresses and phone numbers.\n\n   Where strict probation has been tried, however, the results are\nencouraging. After Williamson County, Texas, probation officers\ndecided to crack down on absconders, they arrested over 1,000\nprobation violators and collected over $65,000 in unpaid penalties.\n\n   In Boston, where probation officers formed partnerships with\npolice and clergy to reduce juvenile violence, more probationers\nthan ever got face-to-face visits, drug treatment, family\ncounseling and help finding jobs. During the first year of the\neffort, the number of people arrested for violating probation\nquadrupled. Shortly afterward, the city went for more than two\nyears without a single gun-related juvenile homicide.\n\n   In Philadelphia, officials discovered that a quarter of the\nmurders in the city's most violent police district were committed\nby felons on probation. Police, prosecutors, clergy and outreach\nworkers pooled information about young probationers in this\ndistrict identified as being at extreme risk of killing or being\nkilled. The police carefully monitored the group, and community\nleaders offered counseling. A year later, while youth violence\nremained high elsewhere in the city, the homicide rate had\nplummeted in the district, and none of the targeted young people\nhad lost their lives or taken those of others.\n\n   After the public learned that a suspect in the murders of five\npeople at a Wendy's restaurant in Flushing, Queens, last May had\npreviously been convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to\nprobation, there were calls to abolish probation. But that would be\na profoundly unwise and unworkable response, tantamount to doubling\nthe prison population overnight. We would do better to give\nprobation departments across the country the administrative tools\nand financial support they need to do their public-safety jobs\nright.\n\n   (John J.
