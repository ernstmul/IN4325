The study, done in\nconjunction with the Department of Education, found that teen-age\nkillers often communicated their plans or shared their feelings\nwith other students, in sharp contrast to the pattern of adults.\n\n   In most ways, rampage killings involving young offenders are no\ndifferent from those involving adults, The Times found in compiling\nits database. Young killers are as likely to strike in small towns\nas in big cities. Both groups are mostly white, but with some\nblacks and Asian-Americans. Both favor semiautomatic weapons.\n\n   But in other compelling ways, the teen-age killers differ. While\nserious mental health problems are common among them, fewer commit\nsuicide after their crimes, The Times found. The younger killers\nare less emotionally detached and more susceptible to peer\ninfluence, experts said.\n\n   Overall, school violence is declining. The number of homicides\nand assaults at schools is down. But a series of mass killings at\nschools in the last four years has seemed to present the country\nwith an ugly new face of school crime _ the sudden, explosive\nrampage killing.\n\n   Although these shootings seem new, the Times study shows that\nteen-age rampage killers were around far before the recent trend.\nAnthony Barbaro, an honor student, killed three and wounded nine at\nhis high school in Olean, N.Y., in 1974. Brenda Spencer, 16, using\na rifle given to her for her birthday, killed two and wounded nine\nat an elementary school near her house in San Diego in 1979. ``I\ndon't like Mondays,'' she told reporters. ``This livens up the\nday.''\n\n   Serious mental problems were reported in the histories of 10 of\nthe 19 teen-agers in the Times study. Two had been in psychiatric\nhospitals. Six showed evidence of psychotic delusions.
