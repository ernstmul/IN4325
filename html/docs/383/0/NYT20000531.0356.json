Times News Service   \n\n   FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, Md. _ Pledging to make mental health care a\npriority in his administration, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday\ncalled for legislation that would force insurance companies to\nprovide children with comparable coverage for mental illnesses as\nfor physical ailments.\n\n   Appearing with his wife, Tipper, before a group of mental health\nprofessionals and advocates in suburban Washington, Gore described\nhis proposal for children as a first step toward eliminating\ndisparities in mental health coverage for adults.\n\n   ``People still have insurance plans that actively discriminate\nagainst mental health,'' he said. ``They still don't recognize it\nas a treatable illness, just like diabetes or high blood pressure\nor heart disease.''\n\n   The proposal was part of a package of mental health programs,\nsome of them not new, that Gore outlined on Wednesday. Those\nmeasures included training teachers and police officers to identify\nmental illness, expanding community mental health services and\ncreating a $3,000 tax credit for families to pay for long-term\ncare, including in mental institutions.\n\n   Achieving parity in insurance benefits for mental and physical\nillnesses has become a legislative goal of mental health advocates,\nwho contend inadequate insurance coverage has discouraged many sick\npeople from seeking treatment.\n\n   Under a 1996 law, group health plans are forbidden to set annual\nor lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are lower than\nthe limits for general medical and surgical services. But a\ncongressional report released two weeks ago found that thousands of\ncompanies were violating the law.\n\n   Some insurance companies have also skirted the law's\nrequirements by simply replacing the old dollar limits on mental\nhealth care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment\nsessions or days in the hospital.\n\n   Legislation with bipartisan support in Congress would try to\nclose such loopholes by prohibiting insurers from setting limits on\nthe number of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for\ntreatment of mental disorders that are more stringent than those\nfor the treatment of physical illnesses.\n\n   In an interview on Wednesday, Gore suggested he would support a\nversion of that legislation, but focused only on children.\n\n   ``We want to close any loopholes that allow insurers to shirk\ntheir obligations under the law,'' he said. But he did not offer\nspecifics.\n\n   Gore's Republican presidential opponent, Gov. George W. Bush,\nsigned legislation in Texas in 1997 requiring health insurers to\nprovide comparable coverage for mental disorders as for physical\ndiseases.\n\n   But Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said the governor has not\nsaid whether he would support similar federal legislation. Bartlett\nadded, ``Governor Bush understands the importance of mental health\nparity.'' Opponents of Gore's proposal, including many business\ngroups, argue that it would significantly increase the cost of\nhealth insurance, potentially causing some employers, particularly\nsmaller ones, to drop their policies. Gore estimated that his plan\nfor children would increase premiums by less than 1 percent, but\nthe opponents said the figure could be five times that much.\n\n   ``Every time you increase costs, you cause people to drop\ncoverage, and the end result is more people without insurance,''\nFrank Coleman, vice president for media relations for the U.S.\nChamber of Commerce. ``The question is, do we want Cadillac\ncoverage, or do we want to find ways to insure the 40 million\npeople without coverage, who mostly work for small businesses?''\n\n   But mental health advocates heralded Gore's proposal as a\ncrucial step toward eliminating discrimination against the mentally\nill.\n\n   ``He's put his finger on a major problem,'' said Laurie Flynn,\nexecutive director for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill, a\nnonprofit group. ``The lack of adequate coverage brings enormous\neconomic hardships to families. They can quickly run through\nsavings, forcing them to re-mortgage houses and dip into college\nfunds.''\n\n   Gore refrained from criticizing, or even mentioning, Bush at\nWednesday morning's event. Indeed, in sharp contrast to his gloomy\nattacks on Bush, Gore was almost relentlessly upbeat, repeatedly\ndescribing the current times as ``exciting,'' ``optimistic'' and\n``hopeful'' for people with mental illnesses.\n\n   ``I truly believe there has never been a more hopeful time for\nmental health care in America,'' Gore said. ``We are on the very of\na new era that will bring revolutionary change.''\n\n   But the vice president did not hesitate to ask the crowd to\nsupport him, saying that he wanted a ``mandate'' to make mental\nhealth a priority in his administration.\n\n   ``That's what elections are all about,'' he said. ``Deciding\namong ourselves the kinds of changes that we're willing to fight\nfor, that we are willing to make a priority.''\n\n   Gore said the shootings at Columbine High School last year\nprovided evidence that the federal government needs to help schools\ntrain teachers to identify mentally ill students and to hire mental\nhealth counselors.\n\n   ``As Columbine taught us, we can't wait until tragedy strikes to\nreach out effectively to troubled young people and give them help\nand hope,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nGORE EXPLAINS HIS MENTAL HEALTH POLICY \n","Text":["\n   FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, Md. _ Pledging to make mental health care a\npriority in his administration, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday\ncalled for legislation that would force insurance companies to\nprovide children with comparable coverage for mental illnesses as\nfor physical ailments.\n","\n   Appearing with his wife, Tipper, before a group of mental health\nprofessionals and advocates in suburban Washington, Gore described\nhis proposal for children as a first step toward eliminating\ndisparities in mental health coverage for adults.\n","\n   ``People still have insurance plans that actively discriminate\nagainst mental health,'' he said. ``They still don't recognize it\nas a treatable illness, just like diabetes or high blood pressure\nor heart disease.''\n","\n   The proposal was part of a package of mental health programs,\nsome of them not new, that Gore outlined on Wednesday.
