Thus people don't seek\ntreatment for them, even though very effective medications exist.\n\n   What we're up against with mental illness is a huge, unofficial\n``Don't tell, don't talk about it'' policy.\n\n   The surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, is trying to end that\npolicy. He has issued a report saying that 22 percent of the\npopulation has diagnosable mental disorders, but two-thirds don't\nseek treatment.\n\n   The report's main recommendation is ``seek help if you\nexperience symptoms of mental illness.''\n\n   You bet, Doc. The Catch-22 is, if you're crazy, you don't think\nyou're crazy. And if you seek help, you're crazy to think you'll\nget much from the average health plan.\n\n   The late Joseph Heller, who invented Catch-22, the rule that\n``anybody who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy,''\nwould have a field day with the surgeon general's advice, as\nwell-meaning as it is.\n\n   Think of all the Catch-22s there are for the 22 percent of\nAmericans with the highly stigmatized disorders of the brain. Seek\nhelp? That's advice seriously out of touch with reality.\n\n   Anybody who is seriously depressed probably is too depressed to\nget out of the house or pick up the phone.\n\n   Anybody planning to commit suicide, as Kay Redfield Jamison\ndiscusses in her new book ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding\nSuicide,'' probably is concealing the fact.\n\n   Anybody who goes out and seeks help for mental problems probably\nfinds they aren't adequately covered in the health plan. There\naren't enough beds on psychiatric units for the seriously ill\neither.\n\n   The craziest thing of all is that medications exist to\neffectively treat depression, manic-depression and certain other\ndisorders, yet people don't take them. It's understandable.\nConsider the stigma.\n\n   That's another Catch-22. You have to be crazy to tell an\nemployer, or a even a friend, you take drugs that keep you sane.\n\n   Not telling and not talking about it are requirements of mental\nillness, unless you're Woody Allen and using psychiatry as a\nrunning (or lying down) gag for your own enrichment.\n\n   Allen has done more than any single individual to make\npsychiatry seem like a ridiculous waste of time fit only for\nweak-willed narcissists _ even at a time when psychiatry has moved\naway from the couch to effective and relatively inexpensive pills.\n\n   But the disappearance of Woody Allen won't help much. The\nstigmatization of mental illness is older than Bedlam, runs wide\nand deep, and it isn't about to disappear quickly.\n\n   Prozac and Zoloft are laugh lines, even though such new drugs\nare effective in treating serious depression in many individuals.\nThey're also knocked by many social commentators as a means to lull\nthe non-ill into Stepford tranquillity.\n\n   Never mind that they only work on the depressed, and have no\neffect on those who are just looking for a high.\n\n   In America, there are three strong streams of non-thought about\nmental illness.\n\n   One says, ``Buck up and pull out of it. It's all in your head.''\nThe problem is, it is all in the head, and sometimes those little\nneurons need some chemical assistance.\n\n   Another says the mentally ill are violent.
