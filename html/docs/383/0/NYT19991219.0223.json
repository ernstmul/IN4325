Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Looked at one way, the surgeon general's new report\nis a comprehensive analysis of the sorry state of America's mental\nhealth care. Looked at another way, it is a primer in two political\ntruisms: one, follow the money; two, beware every policy's\nunintended consequences.\n\n   Consider the money trail: The report faults private insurance\ncompanies for failing to cover mental illness as much as physical\nailments. But it fails to tell you that the federal government\nitself is guilty of the same stinginess. Medicaid, the government's\ninsurance program for the poor, does not reimburse the states for\nthe cost of treating most patients who need long-term care in state\npsychiatric hospitals.\n\n   ``It's federally sanctioned discrimination against the mentally\nill,'' says D.J. Jaffe, a board member of the Treatment Advocacy\nCenter, a public interest law firm for the mentally ill based in\nArlington, Va.\n\n   Now look at the unintended consequences: When Medicaid began in\n1965, excluding reimbursement for institutions for mental disease _\nthe state hospitals _ seemed to make sense. But the policy went its\nown wrong way, with sad, sometimes tragic consequences.\n\n   The policy encouraged the cost-cutting discharge of patients\nfrom state mental hospitals. As the surgeon general, Dr. David\nSatcher, notes, the federal government thought it was wise to keep\nresponsibility for the mentally ill with the states, where it had\ntraditionally been. And it offered subsidies to encourage states to\nmove patients into smaller, more humane community residences.\n\n   The lack of federal dollars and the earlier development of drugs\nthat can stabilize many mental patients stimulated the states to\naggressively empty the big hospitals. Medicaid did offer\nreimbursement for care in smaller residences, defined as those\ncaring for 16 or fewer patients. The theory was perfect: move\npatients out of inhumane warehouses and into the more caring\nsurroundings of group homes.\n\n   The unforeseen troubles were numerous. Communities balked at\ndeveloping group homes. Those that were created generally reject\nthe sickest, most troubled and sometimes violent patients. And the\nstates generally refused to pass along to localities the money they\nwere saving by releasing patients from big institutions.\n\n   Result: a drastic shortage of smaller residences. States have\npushed out huge numbers of patients from large hospitals.\nNationwide, 60,000 people live in state psychiatric hospitals\ntoday, compared with 500,000 in 1965. In New York state, just under\n5,000 patients live where 93,000 were cared for in 1953. If all\nthose released and those never admitted were now getting good,\nsustained treatment, fine. But many live in the streets or move in\nand out of jail. At any given time, for example, 3,000 of the\n20,000 inmates in Rikers Island are judged to be mentally ill.\n\n   Many people in need of long-term care lack the supervision to\nprovide them with medication. The consequences can be tragic.\nAndrew Goldstein, a man suffering from schizophrenia, was living\nwithout care in a basement apartment in Queens, even though he knew\nhe was sick and had begged for hospitalization. As the world now\nknows, he stopped taking his medication and wound up pushing Kendra\nWebdale to her death in front of a subway train.\n\n   Goldstein kept asking to be returned to a group home on the\ngrounds of Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. But there was no room for\nhim, because New York never developed a viable system to care for\nthe severely mentally ill outside the big hospitals, which fell out\nof favor in part because the federal money was no longer there.\n\n   Nor is it likely to be available soon. Donna E.
