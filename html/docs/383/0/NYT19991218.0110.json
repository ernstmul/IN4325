Times Week in Review\nfor Sunday, December 19, will move Saturday.\n\n   On the dress page:\n\n   MILITARY-GAYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The denunciations of the\nmilitary's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, triggered by Hillary\nRodham Clinton and quickly followed by President Clinton and Vice\nPresident Al Gore, don't tell Americans that the policy will be\ntough to change and don't ask why it hasn't worked. By Eric\nSchmitt.\n\n   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)\n\n   TEXAS-BUSH-REVIEW (Houston) _ In a campaign in which both his\nintellect and his experience have come under attack, Gov. George W.\nBush is reminding voters of two things: that he alone among the\nRepublican contenders for president holds executive office, and\nthat governing Texas is a big job, not unlike governing the nation.\nYet Texas actually has one of the weakest gubernatorial offices in\nthe country, a legacy of a Reconstruction-era constitution that was\nwritten to curb executive power. By Jim Yardley.\n\n   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)\n\n   _ Also moving in the `a' category:\n\n   PEANUTS-BASEBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For 50 years, Charles Schulz\ntortured Charlie Brown through a number of devices _ never letting\nhim kick the football, entangling him in the kite-eating tree,\nparalyzing him with fear before the little red-haired girl. Yet\nnone captured Schulz's fondness for futility more deliciously than\nthose involving baseball. Schulz, 77, who will end his ``Peanuts''\nstrip Jan. 4 to focus on treatment for colon cancer, has called\nbaseball his favorite motif of all. By Alan Schwarz.\n\n   TWINN-DOLLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The My Twinn doll, personalized\nfrom a menu of skin tones, eye shades and matching moles, has been\naround for about six years. News articles have raised concerns that\nthe dolls may be inspiring narcissism, creating a plastic race of\nStepford dolls and, worst of all, stifling the imagination of\nchildren by giving them clones for imaginary friends. By Doreen\nCarvajal.\n\n   GOVERNMENT-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ That deafening silence you\nhear is the sound of presidential hopefuls debating whether\ngovernment should intervene in the wage-setting process to help\npeople afford a better life. Today, it seems, everyone agrees that\nthe market does this best. By Louis Uchitelle.\n\n   RELIGION-POLIITCS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Religious language has\nalways played a role in American political life, on rare occasion\nachieving a profound resonance, as it did in Lincoln's Second\nInaugural Address. But politicians who speak publicly about\nreligious belief, lacking Lincoln's eloquence, usually talk in\ngeneral terms. The political statements made in recent days fly in\nthe face of that tradition. By Gustav Niebuhr.\n\n   DRUG-TRIALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In recent weeks a wide array of\ninsurance companies have agreed to pay for experimental cancer\ntreatments administered to policyholders who participate in\nclinical trials sanctioned by federal health agencies. It is a\ndevelopment that experts described as momentous. By Gina Kolata and\nKurt Eichenwald.\n\n   MENTAL-ILLNESS-REVIEW (Undated) The nation is suffering from a\nveritable epidemic of mental illness, according to a report last\nweek by the surgeon general of the United States, which asserted\nthat ``22 percent of the population has a diagnosable mental\ndisorder.'' But how is mental illness defined? There seem to be\nsome large gray areas in which ordinary life-adjustment problems\nand vexing behaviors are classified as mental illnesses requiring\nclinical treatment.\n\n   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.\n\n   _ Also moving in the `i' category:\n\n   RUSSIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Just six months ago, veteran\nRussia watchers were predicting the disintegration of Russia's\ncentral authority, pulled apart by centrifugal forces that were\nmoving power away from the Kremlin. Now, they are not quite so\nsure. At the close of Sunday's parliamentary elections, which are\nwidely seen as a test run for the presidential race next June, the\npolitical picture looks quite different. By Celestine Bohlen.\n\n   PANAMA-CANAL-REVIEW (Panama City) _ Ever since Balboa sighted\nthe Pacific Ocean from a hill here in 1513, this has been one of\nthe world's great geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may\nhave changed, but the link between control of the isthmus and\ndominance in world trade has remained constant. Now, with the\nUnited States having formally handed the canal over to Panama last\nweek, a new phase of that Great Game is beginning. By Larry Rohter.\n\n   SCANDANAVIANS-CHILDREN-REVIEW (Oslo, Norway) _ Anette Sorensen,\nthe Danish mother arrested for leaving her baby unattended on a\nsidewalk outside an East Village restaurant in 1997, wept openly\nlast week when a federal jury rejected her multimillion-dollar\nfalse-arrest claim against New York City.
