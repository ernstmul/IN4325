Today, even though physicians know the disorder has a\nbiological basis, ``the attitude of `pull yourself up by your\nbootstraps' is still there,'' said Matt Aiken, a certified social\nworker and clinical manager at Ellis Hospital's Mental Health Unit\nin Schenectady.\n\n   On Thursday, mental health advocates across the country are\nsponsoring National Depression Screening Day to increase awareness\nabout depression, its symptoms and treatment.\n\n   Over the past decade, there's been dramatic progress in the\ntreatment of depression with new medications that are easier to\ntolerate and safer to take. Yet studies have shown that only one in\n10 Americans receives adequate treatment for the illness.\n\n   As a result, depression has been linked to more than two-thirds\nof the 30,000 reported suicides in the United States each year,\naccording to the 1999 White House Conference on Mental Illness.\n\n   ``A lot of people feel if they have a mental or emotional\nproblem, it's a sign of weakness,'' said Dr. Clifford Passen, a\npsychiatrist at Four Winds hospital in Saratoga Springs. ``There's\nthe attitude of `Why don't I just snap out of it?'''\n\n   Left untreated, the average episode of major depression lasts\nfrom six to 18 months, according to the Mayo Foundation for Medical\nEducation and Research.\n\n   Because symptoms usually recur, people who have one episode will\nusually have four to six additional bouts in their lifetime. The\nnational cost of depression, including lost productivity and worker\nabsenteeism, is estimated at about $50 billion.\n\n   ``It's very risky to think you can get over it on your own,''\nAiken said. ``The majority of suicidal people are depressed. That's\nthe worst case scenario.''\n\n   There's no single cause for depression, but since depression\noften runs in families, specialists think that some people may have\na genetic vulnerability to the condition.\n\n   That vulnerability, in combination with stress, physical illness\nor another major life change, may act to alter the brain's balance\nof neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin.\n\n   Bianchi remembered how low she felt. ``All I wanted to do was\nsleep. I didn't want to clean my apartment. I didn't want to go\ngrocery shopping,'' she said. ``Depression drags you down to the\npoint where you don't care.''\n\n   Depending on the individual, treatment for depression can be\npsychotherapy, or medication to increase the availability of\nserotonin in the brain, or a combination of both, as was the case\nwith Bianchi.\n\n   ``You have to have a good therapist,'' she said. ``If you don't\nclick, it's not going to work.''\n\n   Bianchi also learned that not all medications work for everyone.\nSometimes it can take a few months to find the right drug. She\nhelped her psychiatrist by keeping a journal of how she responded\nto each medicine. ``I wrote everything down from day to day,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   While the combination approach helped pull Bianchi out of her\ndepression, she is careful not to get complacent. ``Once you're\nfeeling better, you just don't stay better,'' she said. ``I have to\nkeep an eye on my attitude.''\n\n   The key is not to ignore the symptoms.\n\n   ``It can be a matter of life and death,'' Aiken said. ``If you\nignore it, it's not going to go away.''\n\n       \n\n   (Sylvia Wood can be reached at 518-454-5445 or by electronic\nmail at swood(at)timesunion.com)\n","Headline":"\nSPECIALISTS SAY TREATING DEPRESSION EARLY IS CRITICAL \n","Text":["\n   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Three years ago, Gail Bianchi wanted to die.\nShe had lost her job, her car, and didn't have enough energy to\nleave her apartment.\n","\n   ``I was at the point where I was thinking of suicide,'' said\nBianchi, 57, of Schenectady. ``I knew something was wrong.''\n","\n   Bianchi was suffering from depression, a brain disorder that\naffects the thoughts, moods, feelings and physical health of more\nthan 17 million Americans.\n","\n   In the past, people used to think depression was ``all in your\nhead.''
