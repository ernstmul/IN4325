(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By RICHARD A. KNOX  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   BOSTON _ A small but remarkable experiment is showing that some\nAIDS patients may be able to control the disease on their own when\ntreatment with potent drugs is halted intermittently.\n\n   The experiment represents the next conceptual push in AIDS\nresearch, now that specialists are convinced it won't be possible\nto eradicate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from patients'\ncells with forseeable treatments.\n\n   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital say they were\nhighly encouraged by the results when they repeatedly stopped\ntriple-drug therapy in HIV-infected volunteers. They described\npreliminary findings from two such patients Friday at a scientific\nmeeting in Philadelphia.\n\n   The AIDS virus came back each time the drugs were stopped, but\nin both cases, there were clear signs that the patients' immune\nsystems were battling to control the emergent virus, with\nincreasing success. In effect, unleashing the virus in a controlled\nfashion may act like a vaccine booster shot.\n\n   ``We think that patients' reexposure to their own virus has\npotentially the same effect that a vaccine would have,'' Dr. Eric\nRosenberg, who presented the new data, said in an interview.\n\n   The maneuver is called ``structured interrupted therapy,'' and\nthe ultimate hope is that it will allow at least some HIV-infected\npatients _ those treated very early in the course of their\ninfection _ to be weaned permanently from antiviral drugs.\n\n   Researchers also expect the experiment will teach them what it\ntakes, immunologically speaking, to keep HIV in check.\n\n   ``We're optimistic _ in fact, quite certain _ that we will get a\nmuch better understanding of what's needed for viral control,''\nsaid Dr. Bruce Walker, director of the MGH's AIDS Research Center.\n``That will guide vaccine development.''\n\n   It's too soon to know if any AIDS patients will be able to throw\naway their antiviral drugs. Still, the signs are encouraging enough\nthat other leading AIDS laboratories have embarked on similar\nexperiments or are gearing up to do them.\n\n   ``Structured interrupted therapy is what everybody's excited\nabout and working on,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal\ngovernment's leading AIDS researcher. ``We and a number of labs\nhave protocols to put people deliberately on intermittent\ntherapy.''\n\n   Still, Fauci cautioned, ``we need to be really careful not to\nmake definitive statements until we see a trend. We need a lot more\npatients.''\n\n   The MGH doctors have another 18 volunteers lined up to do\ninterrupted therapy. They stressed that HIV-infected patients\nshould not stop treatment outside of studies, because close\nmonitoring of viral loads and immune responses are crucial to keep\nthe virus within safe bounds and avoid the emergence of\ndrug-resistant viral strains.\n\n   The new experiments were inspired by the striking observation\nthat some HIV-infected patients have controlled the virus all on\ntheir own. One such patient, Robert Massie, is an Episcopal priest,\nenvironmentalist, and former candidate for lieutenant governor of\nMassachusetts who acquired the AIDS virus in 1978 from an infusion\nof anti-hemophilia factor. Massie has been intensely studied by the\nMGH researchers; his HIV-specific immune response ``is the\nstrongest we've ever seen,'' Rosenberg said.\n\n   Another inspiration is the so-called Berlin patient, a\n30-year-old German man who has become an icon of hope in the AIDS\ncommunity. He took himself off anti-AIDS drugs in December, 1996,\nafter several on-and-off cycles of therapy, and has remained well\never since.\n\n   ``I saw him today and he's in perfect health,'' his physician,\nDr. Heako Jessen, said in a telephone interview last Thursday.\n``His virus is controlled and his immune system is normal, perhaps\nbecause this on-and-off therapy boosted his HIV-specific\nimmunity.''\n\n   Jessen, an independent practitioner who collaborates with the\nMGH researchers, has interrupted drug therapy in 10 patients this\nyear. He reports longer and longer intervals before the virus\nreturns, some reaching three months so far.\n\n   At the MGH, seven patients in all have stopped taking their\nanti-HIV therapy for varying lengths of time, although Rosenberg\npresented data Friday from only the first two at a meeting of the\nInfectious Disease Society of America. To qualify, all such\npatients must have been diagnosed very early _ during the flu-like\nacute illness that usually occurs within weeks of HIV infection.\n\n   Walker and Rosenberg have found that such acutely treated\npatients retain strong immune responses directed at HIV, especially\namong so-called T-helper cells that orchestrate the entire immune\nresponse symphony. Once patients have been infected for months or\nyears, they almost always have lost such potent HIV-specific immune\nresponses, even if they regain responses against tuberculosis,\ntetanus, cytomegalovirus, and other bugs.\n\n   So far the results of the MGH experiments are tantalizing.\n\n   Patient 1, a 32-year-old Boston man, initially went off therapy\nlast July after 17 months on antiviral drugs that had suppressed\nblood levels of HIV below the limits of detection.\n\n   Three weeks later HIV began to show itself, rising slowly to\nabout 17,000 viral copies per milliliter of blood (a thousandth of\na liter). This was only a fraction of the 280,000 virus particles\nthat this patient had when he was first diagnosed, but Rosenberg\nand Walker decided to start drug therapy again lest the virus get\nout of control.\n\n   Still, they were encouraged by the fact that the virus had\nreturned slowly. When most AIDS patients stop multidrug treatments\n(for instance, because of another illness or intolerance to the\ndrugs), the virus comes roaring back to pretreatment levels within\ndays or weeks.\n\n   Patient 1 again stopped therapy in early January of this year\nbecause of a liver ailment. This time something interesting\nhappened. After three weeks without drugs, HIV showed itself in the\npatient's bloodstream, steadily mounting until there were 38,000\nviral copies per milliliter. But just as the doctors were preparing\nto start therapy again, his viral ``load'' began to fall\ndramatically _ to 6,000 copies, then 400 copies.\n\n   ``He was doing it all on his own,'' Rosenberg said.\n\n   Patient 1 started taking antiviral drugs again when he was able.\nEight weeks later, he interrupted treatment again _ and this time,\nhis immune system kept the virus at low levels for four months.\n\n   ``We were in a gray zone of good but not perfect control,''\nRosenberg said. For now, Patient 1 is back on triple-drug therapy,\nbut he and Rosenberg plan another drug ``holiday'' soon to see if\nhis anti-HIV immune response is even more effective the next time.\n\n   Patient 2, a 40-year-old man, also seems to show that the immune\nsystem can be spurred into an effective attack against HIV by early\ntreatment and on-and-off drug cycling.\n\n   Diagnosed with acute HIV syndrome in April, 1997, Patient 2 had\nan initial viral load of more than 1 million copies. Drug treatment\nquickly brought that down to undetectable levels, or less than 50\ncopies, where it remained for 18 months.\n\n   Treatment was interrupted last January 28, but within three\nweeks Patient 2's viral levels had spiked to more than 100,000\ncopies. Drugs again brought that back down below detectable levels.\n\n   When Patient 2 stopped taking drugs the second time, on June 2,\nthe virus remained hidden for two weeks but then crept back into\nhis blood at a low level _ about 200 copies. Over the ensuing\nmonths, the viral level fluctuated in the hundreds to low\nthousands, never rising above 6,500 copies.\n\n   For four months, Walker noted, ``this fellow was at a viral\nlevel which the US Public Health Service guidelines say would not\nneed to be treated.''\n\n   The MGH researchers are encouraged not only by the viral levels\nin these patients, but by their rebounding immune responses to HIV.\nDespite his good response, Patient 2, like Patient 1, decided to do\nanother eight-week round of drug treatment in the hope that a third\n``booster shot'' of HIV ``will be the charm,'' as Walker put it.\n\n   ``Four months off drugs was really liberating,'' Patient 2 said\nin an interview. ``But I decided to go back on to see if at one of\nthese points my natural immunity will keep it in check and I won't\nhave to take drugs at all.
