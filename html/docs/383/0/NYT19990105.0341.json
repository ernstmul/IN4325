Times News Service   \n\n   The proportion of new prison inmates who were drug users at the\ntime of their arrest increased this decade, while drug treatment in\nstate and federal prisons fell sharply, according to a study\nreleased on Tuesday by the Justice Department.\n\n   ``What is particularly tragic,'' said Richard Rosenfeld, a\nprofessor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St.\nLouis, ``is that drug treatment in prison, where it can be coerced,\nhas proven to be effective as an anti-crime program.\n\n   ``This is an unintended consequence of prison expansion,''\nRosenfeld said in an interview. ``Each time we spend a dollar on\nbuilding a new prison or expanding an existing one, it is one less\ndollar for drug treatment.''\n\n   Also Tuesday, President Clinton announced that he would propose\n$215 million in his next budget for testing and treating prisoners\nfor drug use. About $115 million is currently budgeted for\ncombating drug use by prisoners, parolees and probationers.\n\n   The anti-drug proposal had been planned for some time as a\nsignificant part of Clinton's overall anti-crime strategy, White\nHouse aides said. Anticipating bad news in the Justice Department\nreport, they timed its announcement for Tuesday in hopes of\nblunting the report's impact.\n\n   The new study, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, reported\nthat the proportion of state inmates who were had been drug users\nbefore arrest _ that is, had used drugs in the previous month _\nrose to 57 percent in 1997 from 50 percent in 1990, as the\nproportion among federal inmates increased to 45 percent from 32\npercent.\n\n   During those same years, the study said, the proportion of\ninmates in state prisons who received treatment for their drug\nabuse fell to 9.7 percent in 1997, from 24.5 percent in 1991, while\nthe number receiving drug treatment in federal prisons declined to\n9.2 percent from 15.7 percent.\n\n   The report found that participation by inmates in state and\nfederal prisons in other, nonmandatory drug abuse programs, like\ngroup discussions, did increase from 1991 to 1997. But Rosenfeld\nand other experts said these programs, which are cheaper to\nadminister but lack forced participation, are much less effective.\n\n   The increase in drug use by prisoners in state and federal\nprisons in the period leading up to their crimes appears to be the\nresult of increased attention by both law-enforcement officials and\nlegislators to drugs, singling out drug users for more arrests and\ngiving them longer sentences if they have a history of drug\ninvolvement, the experts said.\n\n   The actual number of criminals sentenced to prison for drug\ncrimes increased 6.4 percent a year from 1991 to 1997, only\nslightly faster than the rate of 6.3 percent for those convicted of\nnondrug offenses, the Justice Department said. But police,\nprosecutors and judges are now more likely to take previous drug\nuse into account when making an arrest, bringing charges or passing\nsentence, the experts suggested.\n\n   At the same time, the huge increase in the number of Americans\nin jail or prison, which has more than doubled since 1980 to 1.8\nmillion, has forced many prisons to cut back on a variety of\ncounseling and educational programs in order to make space for more\nbeds for inmates.\n\n   Bruce Johnson, the director of the Institute for Special\nPopulations Research at the National Development and Research\nInstitutes in New York, a nonprofit research organization, said,\n``The drop in substance abuse treatment reflects a systematic\ndecision to reduce these treatment programs and the need to use the\nspace for more inmates.''\n\n   The Justice Department report underscored the strong link\nbetween drug use and criminality, finding that 83 percent of\ninmates in state prisons and 73 percent of those in federal prisons\nhad used drugs at some point in their lives.\n\n   ``Increased substance abuse and criminal offending,'' said\nAndrew Golub, a principal investigator also at the National\nDevelopment and Research Institutes, ``are often characteristic of\nthe downward spiral experienced by many individuals who end up in\nprison.''\n\n   Johnson and Golub have found that crack cocaine use has dropped\nsharply among young people in New York during the 1990s, an\nimportant factor in the decline in violent crime in the city. But\nyoung people now are more likely to smoke marijuana, the\nresearchers have found, a conclusion echoed by the Justice\nDepartment report.\n\n   The Justice Department report also found that more violent\ncrimes were committed by people who had been drinking alcohol than\nby those under the influence of drugs.\n","Headline":"\nOFFENDERS' DRUG USE INCREASES BUT TREATMENT DECLINES, STUDY FINDS\n","Text":["\n   The proportion of new prison inmates who were drug users at the\ntime of their arrest increased this decade, while drug treatment in\nstate and federal prisons fell sharply, according to a study\nreleased on Tuesday by the Justice Department.\n","\n   ``What is particularly tragic,'' said Richard Rosenfeld, a\nprofessor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St.\nLouis, ``is that drug treatment in prison, where it can be coerced,\nhas proven to be effective as an anti-crime program.\n","\n   ``This is an unintended consequence of prison expansion,''\nRosenfeld said in an interview. ``Each time we spend a dollar on\nbuilding a new prison or expanding an existing one, it is one less\ndollar for drug treatment.''\n","\n   Also Tuesday, President Clinton announced that he would propose\n$215 million in his next budget for testing and treating prisoners\nfor drug use.
