Given the misconceptions about mental\nillness, it is not surprising that juries often interpret evidence\nof rational planning as confirmation that a defendant is a faker,\nhis insanity plea nothing more than a staged act of desperation.\n\n   In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court reinforced our\nignorance about schizophrenia in 1983 when it set aside the murder\nconviction of a defendant who claimed that his right to a fair\ntrial had been compromised by the refusal of the trial judge to\nallow the jury to see him in an unmedicated state.\n\n   ``In a case where an insanity defense is raised, the jury are\n(sic) likely to assess the weight of the various pieces of evidence\nbefore them with reference to the defendant's demeanor. Further, if\nthe defendant appears calm and controlled at trial, the jury may\nwell discount any testimony that the defendant lacked, at the time\nof the crime, substantial capacity either to appreciate the\nwrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the\nrequirements of the law,'' the court wrote.\n\n   ``The ability to present expert testimony describing the effect\nof medication on the defendant is not an adequate substitute. At\nbest, such testimony would serve only to mitigate the unfair\nprejudice which may accrue to the defendant as a consequence of his\ncontrolled outward appearance.
