Times News Service   \n\n   At this late date in the Bill Clinton melodrama, it's no scoop\nthat the man has long been in serious need of a good shrink. If\nanything, the compulsive lying may be the least of his aberrations.\nI'm still amazed that so little has been made of this curious\nsentence in the Starr report: ``The longer conversations ((between\nthe president and Monica Lewinsky)) often occurred after their\nsexual contact.''\n\n   Is there another man in creation who talks to women more after\nsex than before?\n\n   Nor is it a scoop that Clinton's ills are rooted in his\nchildhood, since that's the case with most troubled people, not\njust a reckless, cigar-fixated product of the redolently Freudian\nvenue of Hot Springs, Ark. The real question raised by the entire\nTalk magazine fracas is why a man of his age, resources and\nintelligence _ not to mention public duties _ has not had proper\nhelp for a treatable condition. Had he sought it, he, his family\nand the country would all be happier today.\n\n   This question, however, was rarely raised in the fatuous debate\nover whether Hillary Rodham Clinton had made an ``abuse excuse''\nfor her husband by citing his travails as a 4-year-old to her Talk\ninterviewer, Lucinda Franks. That debate was easily resolved: it's\nthere in black and white that Ms. Franks, not Mrs. Clinton, brought\nup the subject of Bill Clinton's rough childhood, and it's also\nthere in black and white that Mrs. Clinton said of her husband,\n``He's responsible for his own behavior whether I'm there or 100\nmiles away.'' But if the First Lady was guilty of only trying to\nexplain her husband's history and not, as was widely charged, of\nfloating an excuse for his adult transgressions, she, like him, is\nhardly off the hook.\n\n   ``Everybody has some dysfunction in their families,'' Mrs.\nClinton also says in Talk. ``They have to deal with it. You don't\njust walk away if you love someone _ you help the person.'' Those\nare the right things to say, but there's no evidence either in the\nhighly detailed interview or the public record or in her husband's\nnow excessively documented private behavior that Mrs. Clinton\nactually helped steer her husband to effective professional help,\ndespite her stated knowledge of the symptoms and history of what\nshe calls his ``weakness.'' Though the president did submit to some\nwelcome pastoral counseling _ or at least did so once the\nimpeachment wolf was at his door _ the White House has repeatedly\nknocked down the possibility that he has received any psychological\ntreatment from a doctor. Instead, as Ms. Franks reports, enabling\nand denial still rule, even now: ``Public office has prevented the\npresident from seeking therapy, but friends told me they expect him\nto after leaving the Oval Office.''\n\n   Talk about too little, too late. This is compartmentalization at\nits most self-destructive. Public office should no more prevent a\npresident from seeking psychotherapy than it should prevent him\nfrom seeking chemotherapy. And the Clintons, of all people, should\nknow that better than anyone _ they've made mental-health care a\npolitical cause. In the 1992 campaign they joined with Al and\nTipper Gore to court boomers by talking openly of their past\nexperiences with family counseling, occasioned by the drug bust of\nClinton's half-brother and the hospitalization of the Gores' son\nafter he was hit by a car. ``By not confronting problems early,''\nClinton said all too prophetically at that time, ``you end up\nmaking things worse.''\n\n   Similarly _ and just two months ago _ the Clintons and the Gores\nheld a full-day White House Conference on Mental Health. The\nsupposed point of that event, they said, was to counter the myths\nof mental illness, thereby encouraging the frightened or\nembarrassed to seek help. ``Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed\nof, but stigma and bias shame us all,'' said Clinton in a radio\naddress. If mental illness is left untreated, he said at the\nconference, ``the loss of human potential is staggering.''\n\n   For all his lofty preaching to the rest of us, perhaps it was\nfear of just such bias that explains (but does not excuse)\nClinton's inability to seek treatment for his own condition, even\nat the cost of putting himself and everyone around him through\nhell. Perhaps he felt that while a sports hero like Mark McGwire or\na TV news star like Mike Wallace or even the country's most popular\nfictional Mafia boss, Tony Soprano, can flourish after going public\nwith their mental-health histories, such revelations still condemn\na chief executive to charges of weakness. But isn't it weaker to\nlet one's emotional problems metastasize rather than address them?\nWhat does it say about our culture that it may be easier for a\npresident to live down having oral sex with an intern in the Oval\nOffice than having oral discourse in a doctor's office?\n\n   Rep. Lynn Rivers of Michigan, the only current member of the\nHouse or Senate to talk openly about battling a mental illness\n(manic depression, for 20 years), points out that politicians would\nrather admit to alcoholism or drug abuse than to receiving\npsychiatric care, even perhaps for a milder ailment. The record\ndoes not contradict her. She and the late Florida Gov. Lawton\nChiles are the only two front-rank American politicians to be open\nabout their histories since Thomas Eagleton was thrown off the\nDemocratic ticket in 1972 after admitting he had been treated for\ndepression.\n\n   Indeed, it could be argued that we are retrogressing rather than\nprogressing in attitudes about mental illness in public life.\nJoshua Wolf Shenk, who is writing a book about Abraham Lincoln's\nlifelong bout with what would now be diagnosed as depression, notes\nthat Lincoln called melancholy ``a misfortune not a fault.''\nLincoln wrote and spoke openly of his ``moods & gloom,'' Shenk\nsays, and friends regarded that melancholy as a source of concern\nand sadness, but not shame.\n\n   On the eve of the White House conference, Tipper Gore tried to\ncounter the taboos that can surround mental illness by going public\nabout her own experience with depression. But for all her good work\non behalf of this issue, Mrs. Gore gave a mixed message similar to\nthat of the Clintons. As the otherwise approving Rivers puts it,\nthe vice president's wife ``could have contributed more by being\nmore specific.'' Mrs. Gore refused to describe the duration or most\ndetails of her treatment, and was careful at each stop of her\nstaged self-outing, from USA Today to ``Oprah,'' to avoid use of\nthe word ``doctor,'' let alone a doctor whose professional title\nmight include the prefix ``psych-.'' (She said she had been treated\nby a social worker rather than a psychiatric social worker.) Even\nas Mrs. Gore made a cause of stamping out the shame associated with\nbeing treated for mental illness, her mystifying circumlocutions\nsent the signal, consciously or not, that she wasn't entirely free\nof shame herself.\n\n   The consequences of Washington's halting efforts to address this\nsubject _ and most lawmakers would prefer to avoid it altogether _\ncan be far more profound than the Starr report. The more\nobfuscation and fear that surround mental illnesses of all types\nand their treatment, the less hope we have of ameliorating public\npolicy and prejudices that leave these illnesses undertreated,\nuntreated and mistreated. At the gravest end of the mental-health\nspectrum, this failure produces catastrophes that are fast becoming\na fixture of the evening news.\n\n   In the aftermath of Columbine, no one stated our predicament\nmore acutely than Dr. W. Walter Menninger, of the famed clinic\nbearing his family's name in Topeka, Kan. Speaking to the American\nPsychiatric Association in Washington, he pinpointed the national\nhypocrisy: ``We recognize incidents of mental illness, and at the\nsame time we stigmatize people who suffer from it or seek help to\ndeal with it. We say `seek treatment,' but at the same time we\nlimit access, and availability, and insurance to pay for it, and in\nthe end make it more difficult to get treatment. There is a\ndisconnectedness between what we say we need as a society and what\nwe do as a society.''\n\n   The results of this schism between words and actions, and the\npiecemeal mental-health system it leads to, cut across all\ndemographic and cultural lines.
