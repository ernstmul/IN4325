HALL  \n c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  \n\n   An ``unprecedented explosion'' in psychiatric problems among the\nelderly is about to hit the country, and the U.S. medical system is\nwoefully unprepared, a panel of psychiatric health specialists\nwarned Tuesday.\n\n   Baby Boomers start reaching retirement age in 2011, the experts\nnoted, signaling a new generation of geriatric mental health issues\ninvolving such problems as substance abuse, late-onset\nschizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression.\n\n   A projected 15 million cases of psychiatric disorders, triple\nthe current caseload, are expected among those age 65 and older by\nthe time the post-war demographic wave crests in 2030.\n\n   The health system already serves mentally ill older adults\npoorly, according to a national ``consensus statement'' on the\nproblem, issued Tuesday by an 11-member panel in the Archives of\nGeneral Psychiatry.\n\n   Authors called for a long-term research and treatment plan to\ncope with ``the upcoming crisis in geriatric mental health.'' They\nforecast a 275 percent jump in psychiatrically ill elderly from\n1970 to 2030, versus only a 67 percent increase in comparable cases\namong those ages 30-44.\n\n   ``Mental illness in the elderly is underdiagnosed and\nundertreated,'' said lead author Dr. Dilip Jeste, director of\ngeriatric psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego.\n``If we do nothing about it, the cost will be social disaster.''\n\n   The panel outlined a 15- to 25-year plan to retool medical\nschools and health providers to deal with psychiatric problems\nexpected to beset aging Baby Boomers.\n\n   Even detecting such conditions is fraught with difficulty among\nolder people because of gaps in research and age-biased diagnostic\nstandards.\n\n   ``Much of our current perspective is based on studies of young\nadults,'' the panel noted.\n\n   Projections of a large increase in geriatric mental illness\nfollow other recent studies showing a relatively high incidence of\nmental health disorders among those born during the post-World War\nII boom. Factors include greater willingness to seek help, less\nfamily support and higher risk of alcoholism and substance abuse.\n\n   Drug problems were cited as a particularly telling example of\nthe aging face of mental health care.\n\n   Use of illicit substances has rarely been considered much of a\nproblem before among the elderly. In the latest\ngovernment-sponsored studies, fewer than 0.1 percent of people\nolder than age 65 had used an illicit drug within the prior month,\ncompared with 3.5 percent of those ages 18 to 24.\n\n   But that may start to change as survivors of the drug culture\nspawned in the '60s and '70s reach old age. One recent study in the\njournal Psychiatric Services, which Jeste co-authored, said\ndemographics alone dictate a steady rise in recreational drug use\nand related problems among the elderly.\n\n   The latest cross-generational data on drug-taking behavior\n``suggest that some Baby Boomers have continued to use illicit\ndrugs as they age,'' the study noted, ``and due to their sheer\nnumbers we can expect larger numbers of current drug users to reach\nage 65 and potentially impact treatment programs.''\n\n   Besides illicit-drug use and alcohol problems, older people also\nare vulnerable to problems caused by prescription medications _\nproblems that often show themselves in the form of psychiatric\nsymptoms.\n\n   ``It's often overlooked,'' said Doug Hennig, a geriatric social\nworker and founder of a new Web site    (www.agenet.com)    aimed at\naging adults and care givers.\n\n   ``A lot of health issues are going to have to be dealt with in\nterms appropriate for this age group, including the mental health\nissue,'' Hennig said.\n\n   Excluding dementia, which is usually due to Alzheimer's and\naffects about 10 percent of the elderly, current estimates show\nthat 13 percent of those over age 65 meet the standard criteria for\nhaving a psychiatric disorder.\n\n   That is ``a serious underestimation,'' according to Jeste and\nhis colleagues.\n\n   The panel, drawn from leading institutions across the country\nincluding the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that\nsocial stigma tends to discourage people from seeking treatment,\nwhile current diagnostic methods tend to be skewed toward younger\npeople.\n\n   In fact, the experts said, many psychiatric conditions are\ngauged in terms of their impact on work lives and other criteria\nthat become less appropriate as the population ages. The panel also\nnoted ``pervasive ageism'' among caregivers, citing one survey that\nfound only 35 percent of primary care internists felt confident\nprescribing anti-depressants to elderly patients, while\nthree-quarters considered depression ``understandable,'' and hence\nnot worth treating, for people 65 and older.\n\n   When all the complicating factors are taken into account, the\nnew consensus statement concluded that nearly 20 percent of today's\nelderly have ``serious psychopathologic symptoms,'' not counting\nthose with delirium and other disorders considered secondary to\ngeneral medical problems.\n\n   That number is expected to rise to nearly 22 percent as the\npopulation ages. Besides more problems overall, the experts\nenvision higher proportions of patients in need of long-term care\nbecause of earlier diagnoses of psychiatric conditions and\ndecreased mortality from physical illness.\n\n   The panel called for a 15- to 25-year research agenda, a push to\ntrain more psychiatrists and psychologists specializing in serving\nan older population, fewer health-plan restrictions on prescription\ndrugs and outpatient services and ``a reduced social stigma against\nthe elderly mentally ill.''\n","Headline":"\nBIG RISE PREDICTED IN MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG ELDERLY\n","Text":["\n   An ``unprecedented explosion'' in psychiatric problems among the\nelderly is about to hit the country, and the U.S. medical system is\nwoefully unprepared, a panel of psychiatric health specialists\nwarned Tuesday.\n","\n   Baby Boomers start reaching retirement age in 2011, the experts\nnoted, signaling a new generation of geriatric mental health issues\ninvolving such problems as substance abuse, late-onset\nschizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression.\n","\n   A projected 15 million cases of psychiatric disorders, triple\nthe current caseload, are expected among those age 65 and older by\nthe time the post-war demographic wave crests in 2030.\n","\n   The health system already serves mentally ill older adults\npoorly, according to a national ``consensus statement'' on the\nproblem, issued Tuesday by an 11-member panel in the Archives of\nGeneral Psychiatry.\n","\n   Authors called for a long-term research and treatment plan to\ncope with ``the upcoming crisis in geriatric mental health.''
