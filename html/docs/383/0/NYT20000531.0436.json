Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ For eight hours after his arrest last week, John\nTaylor sat with investigators in a second-floor squad room at the\n111th Precinct in northern Queens, unwinding the spool of his life,\nfrom his childhood in a Brooklyn housing project to his role in the\nexecution-style slayings of five people in the basement of a\nWendy's in Flushing.\n\n   In a voice devoid of emotion, Taylor detailed the killings,\nexplained how he had acquired the gun, a .380-caliber bought on the\nstreets, and traced his escape route home, cab by cab,\ninvestigators said.\n\n   But they said he never came close to answering the question that\nhung in the interrogation room all night: how a 36-year-old man who\nonce displayed a devoted work ethic, a love for his children and an\nengaging smile had evolved into someone capable of the carnage that\nended an armed robbery.\n\n   ``I spoke to a psychiatrist this afternoon, and even with all\nthe information we have, who can say?'' an investigator said.\n``Maybe he thought there was an easier way than working.''\n\n   Even as police and prosecutors amass what they characterize as\nan overwhelming volume of evidence against Taylor and his\naccomplice, Craig Godineaux, law enforcement officials acknowledge\nthat they have gained little insight into what motivated the\nviciousness of the murders, aside from the pair's concession that\nthey had sought to eliminate all witnesses.\n\n   John Taylor's previous crimes, one burglary and a few robberies\nthat the authorities say he admitted to, were brazen, but never\nviolent. The law-breaking began only a few years ago, after Taylor\nhad built a reputation as a dutiful manager who spent 14 years\nworking in the same McDonald's franchise in Manhattan.\n\n   Investigators acknowledged that perhaps no amount of\npsychological theorizing could ever make sense of what happened in\nthe Wendy's last week. But they said the involvement of Taylor, who\nis thought to have planned the crime, is particularly baffling. By\nall appearances, his crimes had been aberrations in an adult life\nunaffected by mental illness, drug addiction or grudges.\n\n   He filed his income taxes. He paid Social Security taxes for his\nbaby sitter. He took an accident prevention course last year\nsponsored by the New York Department of Motor Vehicles. He was\nknown around his former home in Lefrak City as the sort of person\nwho took his four children, two boys and two girls, 5 to 13 years\nold, to the video store to rent movies like ``The Big Green,'' a\nfamily soccer story; and Jackie Chan's latest high-action thriller.\n\n   ``John seemed like the kind of guy you would trust with your\nkids,'' said Edward Wills, who supervised him for eight of the 14\nyears that Taylor worked as an assistant manager at a McDonald's in\nMidtown. ``I don't think this is the same John.''\n\n   Those who worked with Taylor in five restaurants said he had\ngrown sullen and withdrawn, with few friends. They said he became a\nstrict manager, intolerant of small mistakes, even as he was\naccused several times of filching cash.\n\n   But, as the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, tries to\ndecide whether these killings warrant the death penalty, several\ninvestigators said they were most struck by Taylor's chilling\nability to distance himself from the crime. On the day after the\nkillings, for example, he went to work at a clothing store, where\nhe was a salesman. That afternoon, he called a 26-year-old woman he\nhad begun courting.\n\n   Although authorities have said that Taylor has confessed to\nshooting one of the seven people shot that night, he has yet to\nenter a formal plea. A trial to determine his guilt is months away.\n\n   John Benjamin Taylor, who often uses the nickname Benji, was\nborn March 10, 1964, the first of four children of John and Audrey\nTaylor. He, his younger brother, Vaughn, and two sisters were\nraised in an apartment in Brooklyn.\n\n   His parents, who divorced in 1993 after being separated for at\nleast 10 years, declined to be interviewed for this article, as did\nTaylor's lawyer, John Youngblood.\n\n   Taylor's mother, who now uses her birth name, Audrey Saddler,\nhad recognized the Wendy's on the news as the place where her son\nhad worked, said Roy Earl, her boyfriend. Within hours, she was\nconfronted by detectives seeking to question Taylor.\n\n   After his arrest, Taylor spent hours talking to Detectives Louis\nPia, Brian Quinn and Elizabeth Curcio. By his own account, Taylor\nhas always been closer to his father. He moved from his mother's\napartment in Brooklyn to his father's apartment in Queens in 1982\nafter graduating from East New York Vocational High School.\n\n   Taylor told detectives that the move was prompted by an argument\nwith his mother, who feared he was involved in gang activity and\nmight lure his younger brother into trouble. But residents recalled\nthat, during an era when gang violence in the projects was growing,\nJohn Taylor was routinely seen walking off to work in the uniform\nof a fast-food worker.\n\n   For years, John Taylor seemed to be the more stable of the two\nbrothers. While John was working as an assistant manager at a\nMcDonald's in Manhattan, his brother, Vaughn, was being arrested\nfor minor crimes in Suffolk County, where he lived.\n\n   John Taylor's relationship with both of his parents has\ndeteriorated.\n\n   nn\n\n   Last summer, when he left jail after his arrest on a robbery\ncharge, Taylor filed a complaint with the police, accusing his\nfather of stealing the furniture from his Lefrak City apartment.\n\n   In the fast-food industry, in which workers often change jobs\nfrequently, Taylor was a study in permanence, commuting daily for\nyears from Queens to his job as an assistant manager at a\nMcDonald's in midtown Manhattan. He was punctual and polite, and\nseveral friends recalled that he talked often of owning his own\nstore.\n\n   But something seemed to change in 1996. There were whispers\namong co-workers that Taylor had placed ghost employees on the\npayroll. He was transferred to another location, although Wills\nsaid the only problem had been that Taylor's performance had\nslumped a bit and he wanted to give him a new challenge.\n\n   Several months later, Taylor was discovered at the back at the\nmidtown store at 6 a.m., trying to break into the safe. Taylor, who\nsaid he needed the money for his children, was sentenced to five\nyears' probation. It was his first offense.\n\n   By 1998, he was working as an assistant manager at the Wendy's\nin Flushing. Some former employees said he was pleasant, but\nauthorities said he was caught stealing in May 1999 and transferred\nto another Wendy's for several weeks.\n\n   At the same time, the police say they believe that Taylor, armed\nwith a starter's pistol, embarked on a spree in which he robbed or\ntried to rob five restaurants in Queens, beginning with a Burger\nKing. In that incident, on June 15, a supervisor went for the phone\nto call police and the robber ran off.\n\n   Eight days later, Taylor was arrested, the police said, after he\nrobbed a McDonald's for the second time in four days. He was held\nuntil August, when he posted $3,500 bail and returned home to\nLefrak City to find that his apartment had been emptied of\nfurniture, the authorities said.\n\n   Neighbors said he still had a job, however, as a manager at a\nWendy's in Elmhurst. One neighbor, George Gross, said Taylor helped\nhis daughter get a job at the same store, but she soon found him\nunsettling.\n\n   ``She never complained about anybody the way she complained\nabout him,'' he said. ``She just said: `He's not right. He is too\nserious.'''\n\n   Last October, within a few weeks, Taylor was evicted from his\napartment and was fired from his job, the authorities said. At the\nsame time, out on bail in his robbery case, in which prosecutors\nwere pushing for a 12-year prison sentence, he failed to show up\nfor court.\n\n   He then hid in plain sight, taking a room at $85 a week in a\nprivate house in Jamaica, only three miles from Queens Supreme\nCourt, where a warrant had been issued for his re-arrest.\n\n   He found work a few blocks away, first at a leather goods store\nand later as a salesman at SC&R Clothing, Taylor told detectives.\nHe and Godineaux were both working at the store last week when, the\npolice say, they robbed Wendy's of $2,400 and left seven people for\ndead in the basement.\n\n   The next day, Thursday, Taylor showed up for work, leaving at\n7:30 p.m. to watch the Knicks game.\n\n   The following morning, according to Taylor's statement to\npolice, he heard his name on television as a suspect in the\nkillings, and he decided to flee.\n\n   But first, in an unusual move, he called in sick at the clothing\nstore, said the owner, Anna Biton. She said he told her his father\nhad died and he had to bury him in South Carolina.\n\n   He then went to the home of his brother's wife in Brentwood,\nN.Y., where he was arrested.\n\n   On the way back to Queens, Taylor began telling the first of\nseveral accounts of the killings, a law enforcement official\nrecalled.
