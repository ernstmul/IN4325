Mrs. Gore,\nwife of the vice president, has long championed the rights of\npeople with mental illness.\n\n   Group Health Inc. of New York, like many insurers, has revised\nsome of its mental health benefits in response to the 1996 law.\n\n   ``Annual and lifetime dollar limitations on mental health\nbenefits will be removed,'' the company said in a notice to\nsubscribers in its program for New York City government employees.\nBut it said, ``For outpatient care, the $900 annual maximum and the\n$1,800 lifetime maximum will be replaced with a limit of up to 30\nvisits per year and 60 visits per lifetime.''\n\n   Carmine Russo, director of GHI's program for New York City\nemployees, said the plan's mental health benefits were among the\nmost comprehensive offered anywhere. But Rep. Carolyn Maloney,\nD-N.Y., said, ``While this level of benefits may be in technical\ncompliance with the Parity Act, it clearly violates the spirit of\nthe law, which was intended to ensure that physical and mental\nillnesses would receive the same level of coverage.''\n\n   Hewlett-Packard Co. illustrates another way some businesses have\nresponded to the law. The company had a lifetime limit of $1\nmillion on medical benefits for any employee or dependent, and no\nmore than $300,000 of that amount could be spent on mental health\ncare.\n\n   ``We still have the lifetime ceiling of $1 million,'' said Paula\nWallace, the health benefits manager for Hewlett-Packard, ``but the\n$300,000 limit for mental health was eliminated. We now have a\nsingle lifetime limit of $1 million on physical and mental health\nbenefits combined, with no distinction between the two.''\n\n   Hewlett-Packard has not experienced the sharp increase in costs\nthat many employers fear. ``Our mental health costs have been\nstable through 1998,'' Ms. Wallace said, in part because the\ncompany uses managed-care techniques to make sure patients receive\nappropriate but not excessive services.\n\n   Alfonso Guida Jr., vice president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, an advocate for people with mental disorders, said the\napproach taken by Hewlett-Packard was ``consistent with the intent\nof the law.''\n\n   But ``many insurers and employers are taking steps to bypass the\nfederal law,'' Guida said, ``changing the structure of their\nbenefits to impose discriminatory inpatient and outpatient visit\nlimits in place of the previous spending caps.''\n\n   Nineteen states have laws that require the same or similar\nlevels of coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Some of the\nstate laws, going further than the federal law, prohibit insurers\nfrom setting higher deductibles or patient fees for mental health\ncare than for other medical services.\n\n   Bachman, the actuary at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said health-care\nplans often paid a smaller share of bills for mental treatment than\nfor other kinds of care. For example, he said, if a psychiatrist\nsubmits a $90 bill for psychotherapy, the plan may count only $50\nas an eligible expense and then may pay only 50 percent of that, or\n$25. In contrast, Bachman said, if a family practitioner submits a\nbill for $90, the insurer may pay 80 percent of that amount, or\n$72.\n\n   The 1996 law does not require employers to provide any mental\nhealth benefits, but most companies that offer health insurance to\nemployees do cover some mental health care.\n\n   An employer may obtain an exemption if it can show, with at\nleast six months of data, that compliance with the 1996 law has\ncaused an increase of 1 percent or more in the overall cost of its\nemployee health plan. But Labor Department officials said that only\nfour companies had requested such exemptions.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   Aides to Tipper Gore, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on\nmental health issues, said she favored such legislation.
