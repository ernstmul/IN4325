Times News Service    \n\n   PHOENIX _ A thief, a burglar, a gang member, a drug dealer and a\nmother stepped into a windowless, brick-walled room here one recent\nafternoon, stripped of their pride and any material possession that\nmade them somebody outside that room.\n\n   They were drug addicts in treatment, and each of them might well\nhave been in prison under federal law and the statutes of most\nother states. But in defiance of Arizona's political establishment,\nvoters took the law into their own hands and voted twice, by large\nmajorities, to make their state the first to mandate treatment\ninstead of prison for criminal offenders whose primary legal\nproblem is drug use.\n\n   So five people sat in that ground-floor room, talking about how\ntough it was to keep away from the pills, powder and smoke that\nformerly dominated their lives. Several had been heavy users of\ncrack cocaine, once characterized as so addictive that its users\nwere beyond help. Each of the five has tested clean for drugs.\n\n   ``Believe me, this is harder than jail,'' said Albert Delatorre,\nthe former gang member who would have faced up to five years in\nprison before the new law mandated treatment. ``It's been a\nstruggle. But treatment has helped me become a man. I've grown\nup.'' He is 22.\n\n   A dozen years after the national alarm over crack hastened the\ndecline of drug treatment in favor of punitive laws that helped\ncreate the world's largest prison system, anti-drug policy is\ntaking another turn. Treatment is making a comeback, driven largely\nby a grass-roots revolt.\n\n   Arizona has taken the boldest step, but at least 40 states have\nset up drug courts to steer offenders toward treatment instead of\njail. A number of states are considering changing their mandatory\nprison laws for drug offenders, most notably New York, which was\nthe first to require long sentences for possession of small amounts\nof drugs 26 years ago.\n\n   In the crack years of the 1980s, treatment programs were gutted\nwhile the drug-fighting budget quadrupled. News reports said crack\nwas the most addictive substance known to man, and prisons started\nto fill with people who once might have gotten help instead. The\nnumber of Americans locked up on drug offenses grew from 50,000 in\n1980 to 400,000 today.\n\n   Yet even during the height of the prison boom, when some people\nwere sentenced to life behind bars for possessing small amounts of\na drug, a number of treatment centers continued to have success.\n\n   While not all addicts respond to treatment _ some studies show\nthat a majority fail, usually in the first month _ these programs\nshowed that crack was less addictive than some other street drugs,\nor even nicotine, and that many of its users responded to\nconventional group therapy. Habitual users of crack, according to a\nfive-year federal survey of treatment published last year, showed\ngreater success at staying clean than alcoholics.\n\n   ``It was simply nonsense, this notion that crack addicts were\nuntreatable,'' said Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, the president of\nPhoenix House of New York, the nation's largest private, nonprofit\ndrug treatment institution, which has worked with more than 75,000\naddicts over the last 30 years.\n\n   Some of the experts who called crack the worst drug of all have\ndone an about face.\n\n   ``I've changed my view because of the data that has come in over\nthe last 10 years,'' said Dr. Charles O'Brien, chief of psychiatry\nat the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia, who\nin the late '80s described crack as ``by far, the most addictive\ndrug we've ever had to deal with.''\n\n   What changed his mind were national surveys that showed 84\npercent of people who tried cocaine _ either smoking it as crack or\ninhaling it in powder form _ did not become addicted. He said he\nhad also been swayed by a study he co-wrote of habitual users of\ncrack who were assigned to treatment. A year after treatment, at\nleast half tested free of drugs.\n\n   ``It turns out that many people can, and do, stop using crack _\neven those who were addicted to it,'' O'Brien said.\n\n   THE IMPETUS: From the Voters, A New Mandate\n\n   Locking up crack users is still the policy in the federal\nsystem. A person caught with 5 grams of crack _ worth about $125 on\nthe street _ and prosecuted under federal drug laws faces a\nmandatory five years in prison if convicted. Crack is the only drug\nthat carries a mandatory prison term for possession.\n\n   But in Arizona, because of a voter initiative, the same crack\nuser prosecuted under state laws cannot be sent to prison. Instead,\nhe must undergo drug treatment. The money for treatment comes from\nthe offenders themselves and from a tax on liquor.\n\n   Many states have adopted similar policies by establishing drug\ncourts, which sentence people to treatment as a way to keep them\nout of jail.
