Times News Service  \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Spending on prescription drugs increased a record\n17.4 percent last year, and elderly people saw the largest cost\nincreases, a new study by a drug benefits company says.\n\n   The study, issued Monday by Express Scripts of St. Louis, said\nabout half of the total increase in drug spending resulted from\nhigher costs for a typical prescription. Greater use of\nprescription drugs and the introduction of new drug products were\nresponsible for the remainder of the increase, it said.\n\n   Express Scripts manages drug benefits for 9.6 million people and\nderived the study from that data.\n\n   Barrett Toan, president of Express Scripts, said last year's\nincrease accelerated a trend observed since 1993, when the company\nbegan monitoring changes in drug spending.\n\n   New drugs were a significant factor contributing to the increase\nin spending last year, as doctors and patients quickly accepted two\ndrugs used to treat arthritis, Vioxx, made by Merck & Co., and\nCelebrex, marketed by Searle and Pfizer, the study said.\n\n   More generally, it said, drugs introduced since 1992 accounted\nfor a remarkable 41 percent of drug spending last year and for 25\npercent of all prescriptions filled last year.\n\n   The study comes just two days before the House is expected to\nvote on proposals to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare\nbeneficiaries. One-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries\nhave no insurance to help pay drug costs.\n\n   Statistics compiled by Express Scripts show why elderly people\nfeel a pressing need for such coverage and why many members of\nCongress worry about the costs.\n\n   Spending on prescription drugs averaged $387.09 a person last\nyear, up 17.4 percent from the average of $329.83 in 1998, Express\nScripts reported. But costs rose most rapidly for older Americans,\nit said.\n\n   The average price for a prescription last year rose 18 percent\nfor women aged 70 to 79, 20 percent for women 80 and older, 9\npercent for men age 70 to 79 and 11 percent for men 80 and older,\nthe study said.\n\n   The report said that Enbrel, a new drug for rheumatoid\narthritis, contributed more to the increase in drug spending last\nyear than more celebrated drugs like Viagra. Enbrel, produced by\ngenetic engineering, may cost $1,000 a month.\n\n   In its report, Express Scripts made these observations:\n\n   _ The number of prescriptions for antihistamines increased 18.4\npercent last year. In 1999, as in the two prior years, use of\nantihistamines increased more than the use of any other type of\ndrug. The increase was driven by heavy advertising for products\nlike Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec.\n\n   _ Cholesterol-lowering drugs were the second-fastest growing\ncategory last year, as the number of prescriptions increased 18.1\npercent. Lipitor, made by Warner-Lambert, and Zocor, made by Merck,\naccounted for much of the growth.\n\n   _ Use of antidepressant drugs increased 11.3 percent last year.\nAs the stigma of mental illness is reduced and more people become\naware of the symptoms of depression, they are more likely to\nreceive drug therapy.\n\n   _ Use of gastrointestinal drugs increased nearly 10 percent last\nyear, in part because of advertising for products like Prilosec.\n\n   Express Scripts said the unit price of prescription drugs rose\nan average of 5.4 percent last year, which was substantially more\nthan the increases for other major goods and services like food,\nhousing and transportation.\n\n   The prices of generic drugs rose an average of 7 percent last\nyear, while prices of brand-name medications rose an average of 5.8\npercent, the report said. Generic versions of brand-name drugs\ntypically cost less, but federal officials say they are\ntherapeutically equivalent.\n\n   Among the drugs with the largest price increases last year were\nthyroid medications, narcotic painkillers and estrogen replacement\nproducts.\n\n   Synthroid, a synthetic thyroid hormone sold by the Knoll\nPharmaceutical Co., accounted for much of the increase in thyroid\ndrug costs, while Premarin, made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories to\ntreat symptoms of menopause and osteoporosis, accounted for much of\nthe increase in estrogen therapy prices, the report said.\n","Headline":"\nSTUDY SAYS SPENDING ROSE 17.4 PERCENT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN\n1999 \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Spending on prescription drugs increased a record\n17.4 percent last year, and elderly people saw the largest cost\nincreases, a new study by a drug benefits company says.\n","\n   The study, issued Monday by Express Scripts of St. Louis, said\nabout half of the total increase in drug spending resulted from\nhigher costs for a typical prescription.
