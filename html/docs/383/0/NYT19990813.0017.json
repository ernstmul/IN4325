Furrow Jr. got the treatment\nhe needed from Washington state's mental-health system.\n\n   Clint Merrill, a friend and neighbor of the Furrows in Olympia\nfor 24 years, said Furrow's father is angry that his son didn't get\ncloser supervision from mental health professionals after his\nrelease from prison in May.\n\n   ``They are disappointed that (the system) didn't give him more\nhelp,'' Merrill said. ``If a person doesn't want to take their\nmedicine, they won't. That is what his dad thinks, that he didn't\ntake his medication, and he sort of went off.''\n\n   But because Furrow's mental-health records remain confidential\nunder state law, it's not clear that there is more that authorities\ncould have reasonably been expected to do to prevent Furrow from\nallegedly launching his hateful attack on a Los Angeles-area Jewish\nday care center Tuesday. Furrow has also been charged in the\nkilling of a postal worker after the day-care shooting.\n\n   Just a week before the attack, Furrow made his regularly\nscheduled appointment in Olympia with his community corrections\nofficer, who concluded Furrow was meeting all the conditions of\nrelease. Officer Pat Gosney concluded that Furrow had been staying\naway from alcohol, guns, and the psychiatric workers he had\nattacked nine months before, and was consistently taking his\nmedications. Random drug testing ordered by Gosney had confirmed\nthose prescription drugs were in his system in July, Department of\nCorrections spokesman Veltry Johnson said yesterday.\n\n   Johnson said that corrections staff did not search Furrow's home\nor car for guns or alcohol, as they can legally do.\n\n   Critics Thursday charged that given Furrow's mental-health\nhistory, the court also should have ordered intensive mental-health\ntreatment after his release. The King County Superior Court judge\nwho handled his case, Harriet Cody, did not order such treatment.\nShe could not be reached for comment.\n\n   ``I think it's pretty clear that he came out of the King County\nJail and fell through the cracks,'' said Tom Richardson, Washington\npresident of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. ``Mentally\nill people on medications need supervision. There is an ignorance\non the part of the court in thinking that you can just require\nsomeone to take their medication and that is enough.''\n\n   But mental-health professionals Thursday cautioned the public\nfrom jumping to the conclusion that Furrow, a card-carrying member\nof the Aryan Nations Church, allegedly sprayed the day-care center\nwith gunfire because of mental illness. Without having seen his\nmental health records, they said it's dangerous to surmise his\nviolence was a result of his lack of treatment, or could have been\nprevented if he had been confined for longer in a psychiatric\nhospital, they said.\n\n   ``It's not appropriate for everyone who demonstrates dangerous\nbehavior to be in a hospital,'' said psychiatrist Ira Klein,\ndirector of civil adult services at Western State Hospital.\n``Thousands of people commit violent crimes, and they aren't\nschizophrenics.''\n\n   He noted that psychiatric hospitals can only treat people for\nmajor mental illnesses, and not hold them because they are racist\nor express a desire to do violence against certain groups.\n\n   Because of patient confidentiality rules, state authorities\ncannot release the files they compiled during the seven months\nFurrow spent in two state psychiatric facilities and in a county\njail with a staff of psychologists and psychiatrists.\n\n   Furrow's only run-in with police in Washington stemmed from his\nattempt to check himself into a Kirkland psychiatric facility last\nOctober.\n\n   Furrow told psychiatric workers then that he had been\nfantasizing about opening fire at the Alderwood Mall and killing\nhis estranged wife and her friends. But his plea for help turned\nviolent when he pulled a knife on psychiatric workers who refused\nto give him back his car keys. He only dropped the switchblade when\na county sheriff's deputy pulled his gun.\n\n   After his arrest on a Wednesday, the county jail's\nwell-respected psychiatric unit quickly spotted Furrow as someone\nin need of a thorough evaluation. A jail psychologist pushed\ndeputies to file charges quickly so he could be held for that\nevaluation. Deputies did move fast, closing the case on Friday, but\nFurrow managed to post bond before prosecutors filed the charges\nMonday.\n\n   Still, he and his parents recognized he needed help, and they\ntook him to Harborview Medical Center for an evaluation, according\nto court records.\n\n   Later, after he was charged with second-degree assault, he was\ntaken to Western State Hospital in Steilacoom for further\nevaluation and treatment, Dan Donohoe, spokesman for the King\nCounty Prosecutor's Office, confirmed yesterday.\n\n   But Furrow was not sent to Western State for an evaluation of\nwhether he was competent to stand trial, Klein said, and therefore\nhe was not judged to be insane at the time he assaulted the\npsychiatric workers in Kirkland.\n\n   There is only one other reason the hospital could have taken him\nfor treatment: He had been committed because he was deemed a danger\nto himself or the community.\n\n   Klein could not legally comment on what treatment Furrow\nreceived. But he said the hospital's goal is to evaluate patients,\nstabilize them, and then return them to the community supported\nwith ongoing treatment and medication.\n\n   One Dec. 11, Furrow was sent from Western State back to the\ncounty jail.\n\n   Klein cautioned that a decision that a patient is stable enough\nto be returned to the security of the jail, where their treatment\nand medication can be supervised by psychiatric professionals, is\nnot the same as deciding the person is ready to be released into\nthe community.\n\n   On Dec. 17, Furrow was arraigned on the assault charges.\nInitially, Furrow's defense attorney, Leona Thomas, entered a\nnot-guilty plea by reason of insanity.\n\n   During that time, Thomas' request for more expert evaluation of\nFurrow was granted. But the portion of his file containing his\nmental health record has been sealed by the court. Later, Furrow\nwithdrew the insanity plea and entered a guilty plea.\n\n   Both Klein and Sherry Storms, the Mental Health Ombudsman for\nthe county, said mentally ill people often decide to plead guilty\nto criminal charges because they realize that their stay in a\npsychiatric facility would keep them confined even longer.
