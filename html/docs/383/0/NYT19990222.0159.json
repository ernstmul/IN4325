They have\nattacked as unethical several federally-funded studies that\ninvolved giving ketamine and other drugs to mentally ill patients\nto induce symptoms of psychosis. The studies were a focus of a\nGlobe series in November, 1998.\n\n   While the authors of the rat study and anesthesiologists say\nit's too soon to draw conclusions about effects in humans based on\nthe animal data, they say the results call for further\ninvestigation. Ketamine is no longer widely used for anesthesia in\npregnant women or children, but under certain circumstances it\nstill offers benefits that outweigh any risks, say\nanesthesiologists.\n\n   But the study's authors say it's not too soon to issue a warning\nto pregnant women based on the study's findings: Don't abuse\nketamine _ used on the streets for its hallucinogenic properties\nunder the name ``Special K'' _ or any other drugs, including\nalcohol, laughing gas or the street drug PCP, that appear to act on\nthe same so-called NMDA receptor in the developing brain.\n\n   ``The main message that should be conveyed to the public is that\nabusing these drugs during pregnancy is very unwise _ in fact,\nirresponsible,'' said Dr. John W. Olney, professor of psychiatry\nand neuropathology at Washington University School of Medicine in\nSt. Louis, and one of the authors of the study in the Jan. 1 issue\nof Science.\n\n   The study, which involved newborn and fetal rats, found that up\nto 30 percent of developing neurons in parts of the rat brain\ncommitted ``cell suicide'' _ apoptosis _ when exposed to ketamine,\nPCP (also known as angel dust), MK-801 and another drug that blocks\nthe cells' NMDA receptors.\n\n   Such cell death was observed about 24 hours after a single high\ndose of one of the drugs was given to block NMDA receptors for at\nleast eight hours. The blocking action apparently prevents certain\nbrain chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, from fitting into\nthe NMDA receptors at a critical point in brain development,\nleading to cell death.\n\n   ``Many millions, probably billions, of nerve cells have that\nreceptor . . . in the context of a brain that has trillions of\nnerve cells,'' said Olney in an interview. ``The number of neurons\nthat can be deleted from the brain by this mechanism is somewhere\nin the range of probably 10 million or so.''\n\n   Earlier studies of NMDA receptors in Olney's lab and elsewhere\nhave led to the hypothesis that the receptors are somehow involved\nin schizophrenia. That helped prompt a recent line of psychiatric\nresearch using ketamine to induce psychotic symptoms in people with\nschizophrenia and in healthy volunteers, in an attempt to\nunderstand the biology of psychosis and perhaps one day come up\nwith better treatments.\n\n   One leading critic of this research said the new rat study\nraises even more questions about administering ketamine to induce\npsychotic symptoms in people.\n\n   ``This really confirms further the Boston Globe series, that the\nuse of these toxic substances without medical benefit to these\npatients was inappropriate,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of\nMaryland bioethicist who co-founded, along with Vera Hassner\nSharav, a New York-based advocacy group called Citizens for\nResponsible Care in Psychiatry and Research.\n\n   But Olney said he did not believe his latest study has a bearing\non the psychiatric research, since it looked at developing rat\nbrains, not adult rat brains.\n\n   ``In order for it to be relevant, these studies would have to be\nperformed on pregnant women. I don't know that they are being\nperformed on pregnant women. I certainly don't think they are,''\nsaid Olney. ``If they chose to admit some subjects to their study\nwho are six-month-old infants, then there might be some relevance.\nBut I don't believe anybody is doing that.''\n\n   One of Olney's co-authors, Dr. Chrysanthy Ikonomidou of Humboldt\nUniversity in Berlin, said the study suggests that cell death\nprompted by ketamine in the developing brain could be linked to\nschizophrenia later in life. A number of human studies have found\nan association between abnormalities in cells with NMDA receptors\nand schizophrenia in adults, without establishing why the\nabnormalities occurred, she said. Animal research is now being done\nto look at cause and effect.\n\n   An earlier animal study out of Olney's lab did look at ketamine\nand adult rat brains, and it found that high doses of the chemical\ncreated temporary vacuoles, or cavities within cells.\n\n   While Olney said the formation of vacuoles ``is a form of\ntoxicity,'' the cavities closed up on their own, suggesting that\nthere's probably nothing to worry about in adult humans exposed to\nsmaller doses, as in some of the psychiatric research.\n\n   For Shamoo, however, the important question is not whether\nanimal studies have proven that ketamine causes permanent brain\ndamage, but whether giving ketamine to people with mental illness\nto study psychosis is ethical at all, when there is no medical\nbenefit from it.\n\n   ``You don't use people as a means to an end,'' Shamoo said. He\nalso doesn't buy the argument that because the animal research has\ndocumented only temporary vacuoles in adult rat brains, it is safe\nfor the psychiatric research can go on.\n\n   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of\nMental Health, has suspended clinical involving ketamine at the\ninstitute's own facilities on the grounds that they lack scientific\nmerit, and the federal agency is reviewing its funding of similar\noutside research.\n\n   Hyman declined in an interview earlier this month to discuss\nwhether the animal studies involving ketamine have a bearing on the\npsychiatric research. Psychiatric researchers say animal studies\ninvolve doses of ketamine much higher than those used in their\nresearch.\n\n   The dosages in the Science rat study are also much higher than\nthose used to anesthetize humans, researchers say, though the agree\nthe findings suggest a need for more research.\n\n   Ketamine was more widely used as an anesthetic about 15 years\nago, until its hallucinogenic effects were noted. (Ketamine causes\nsuch effects only in adults, not children.) Better anesthetics have\nsince become available, but ketamine has the advantage of not\nlowering blood pressure or blocking airways and is still useful for\npatients in shock or with severe asthma, say anesthesiologists.\n\n   ``It would be a leap to incriminate ketamine based on that\narticle,'' said Dr. David Birnbach, president of the Society for\nObstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, which will be discussing the\nstudy at its annual meeting in May. But, he added, ``I do believe\nthere are some subtle risks we do now have to investigate.''\n\n   Dr. Frank McGowan, an anesthesiologist at Children's Hospital in\nBoston and an officer of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia,\nsought to reassure parents worried about children undergoing\nanesthesia. ``Our drugs are very safe,'' said McGowan, whose\nsociety discussed the study over the weekend.\n\n   In the years that ketamine was more widely used, no long-term\nconsequences were documented, McGowan noted.\n\n   ``I think the issues raised by the article are in fact real''\nand bear further investigation, he said, but ``it still is a drug\nthat has its place.''\n","Headline":"\nSTUDY RENEWS DEBATE ON PSYCHOSIS-INDUCING RESEARCH \n","Text":["\n   A study showing that the anesthetic ketamine kills brain cells\nin developing rats has added to a debate over using it in pregnant\nwomen and children, and it has injected a surprising new element\ninto a controversy over psychiatric research involving the\nchemical.\n","\n   One national organization of anesthesiologists discussed the\nimplications of the finding this weekend at a scientific meeting in\nLas Vegas, although no action was taken, and a second group plans\nto take up the issue in May in Denver.\n","\n   Critics of psychiatric studies using ketamine seized on the rat\nbrain research, published in the journal Science.
