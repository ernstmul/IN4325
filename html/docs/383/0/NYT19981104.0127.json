Questions had been raised about whether\nBubb and Brame had been warned by student athletes about Abraham's\npossible drug use up to two years ago and whether they handled the\nsituation properly.\n\n   ``It is troubling to us that we're not able to understand the\nfull details of this arrest, but all of us have an obligation to be\nsensitive and watchful of those in authority over young people,''\nWilson said at a news conference Tuesday night.\n\n   ``Whether it (involves alcohol, drugs or mental illness) ...\nit's something that should be fairly understood. Any behavior that\ndoes not create a positive environment for students should be of\nconcern.''\n\n   In accepting the resignations, she said in a statement: ``I\nrespect the personal responsibility both have taken ... and thank\nthem for their years of service to the university.''\n\n   Bubb, the athletic director since 1995, and Brame failed to\ninform _ according to Wilson _ senior university officials of\nallegations of alleged drug use by Abraham, which were made to Bubb\nby members of the team following the 1996 season.\n\n   ``(Bubb and I) had talked Monday night about the\ncircumstances,'' Wilson said. ``The content was that there was a\nseriousness to the conclusion of the internal investigation about\nprior knowledge.''\n\n   The resignations are effective Friday.\n\n   Bubb, 41, is leaving the university while Brame, a tenured\nprofessor, is being reassigned to an academic post within the\nkinesiology department, Wilson said.\n\n   Brame, senior associate athletic director, became acting women's\nbasketball coach following Abraham's arrest and also has resigned\nfrom that post.\n\n   Wilson ordered the internal investigation, conducted by Mary Ann\nCummins-Prager, assistant vice president of student affairs,\nThursday after learning Bubb had been approached by the players in\n1996.\n\n   Bubb said publicly Oct. 28 that he ``never'' heard anything\nlinking Abraham with drugs but later admitted players had voiced\nconcerns to him about Abraham's erratic behavior. The internal\ninvestigation found Bubb subsequently told Brame, 58.\n\n   ``As information about Michael Abraham has been reviewed over\nthe past week by the university, my judgment has been questioned in\nregards to confidential information I received from\nstudent-athletes in February 1997,'' Bubb said in a statement.\n\n   ``While I found some of the issues the student-athletes brought\nto me to be true and I addressed those issues with coach Abraham, I\ndid not have information presented to me during my review which\ncould confirm drug use by coach Abraham.''\n\n   Bubb said he spoke with members of California State University,\nNorthridge's athletic department, student-athletes and senior\nmembers of Oregon State's athletic department, Abraham's former\nemployer.\n\n   ``Nonetheless, I confronted coach Abraham and asked if he was\nusing drugs and he denied the allegation,'' Bubb said. ``I\nconsidered the matter closed and did not forward any further\ninformation to the vice president or president.''\n\n   Bubb was visibly shaken and needed to pause during his\nstatement. He had been with CSUN since 1990 and was the school's\nathletic director since July 1995. Wilson said at no point did she\nask Bubb to resign, saying it wasn't necessary.\n\n   Both positions will be filled on an interim basis later this\nweek, Wilson said. National searches are to take place for\npermanent replacements.\n\n   Wilson, who met with the women's team Tuesday afternoon, said\nplayers and assistants are expected to meet and discuss candidates\nto take over the women's program for now. A senior women's coach\ncould oversee the basketball program, Wilson said.\n\n   Sources said Wilson wants a current coach to fill the athletic\ndirector's job on an interim basis. One candidate is men's\nbasketball coach Bobby Braswell, sources said, and Fred Strache,\nassociate vice president of student affairs, also is expected to\nmake a push for the interim athletic director spot.\n\n   ``This is a very difficult time for our university,'' Braswell\nsaid. ``People have been hurt. Student-athletes, staff, the school,\nand it was probably the right thing for Paul and Judy to do at this\ntime. It's hard. It's hard for me because of my relationship with\nPaul. Both Judy and Paul have done a lot for this school.''\n\n   Brame declined comment but did release a statement.\n\n   ``Because I care deeply about Cal State Northridge athletics and\nmy effectiveness in this area, I have concluded that it is in the\nbest interest of the program for me to resign my administrative\nresponsibilities,'' she said.\n\n   ``My various roles in the athletic department for the past 24\nyears have constituted the major part of my professional career,\nand I have found it rewarding. I look forward to returning to an\nacademic career.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)\n\n   The news of Bubb's resignation was expected among the coaches\nafter a Tuesday morning meeting with Wilson, but news of Brame's\nresignation from the athletic department was met with surprise and\nregret.\n\n   ``I'm really shocked with the day's events,'' said softball\ncoach Janet Sherman. ``They've both given their hearts to the\nprogram.''\n\n   During the morning meeting, Wilson said many coaches suggested a\nvoluntary drug-testing program.\n\n   Bubb, who earns $86,700 a year, was hired in 1990 by the\nUniversity Foundation, CSUN's independent fund-raising arm, as the\ndirector of athletics development. He became interim director of\nathletics in July 1995 and was appointed permanent director the\nfollowing April following a nationwide search.\n\n   Brame, who earns $90,400 annually, started at the university in\n1974 as a physical education professor. She was promoted in 1978 to\nassociate professor and became a full professor in 1982. She became\nsenior associate director of athletics, her most current title, in\nJuly 1989.\n\n   ``A lot of things have come down on the athletic department, so\nsomeone's got to feel the burden,'' said football player Vito\nClemente. ``I guess it's got to be at the top.''\n\n   Of course, there is the question of what happens should Abraham\nbe cleared of all charges.\n\n   Abraham was arrested the night of Oct. 27 by the FBI.
