Times News Service   \n\n   The Legal Aid Society has sued the state to try to force it to\nprovide residential treatment for severely mentally ill children\nwho now are on waiting lists and languish in inappropriate settings\nfor months, sometimes more than a year.\n\n   But the shortage of residential treatment facilities is just\npart of a much larger crisis in the delivery of services to\nthousands upon thousands of mentally ill children who are suffering\ngrievously, and who often are a threat to themselves or others.\n\n   Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature have taken some\nrecent steps to address this problem. But far more attention is\npaid to the needs of mentally ill adults, and services for them get\nthe bulk of the state's money. The children get what's left, which\nisn't much.\n\n   So you get situations like that of a boy, now 11, who was\nprofiled in a report put out a few weeks ago by the Citizens\nCommittee for Children of New York. The boy was diagnosed as\npsychotic at a very young age and behaves, to put it mildly,\nbizarrely. When he became angry with a teacher named Mrs. Siegal he\nwent to the beach, killed a sea gull and brought it to her.\n\n   The report said his speech is disorganized and he suffers from\ndelusions. He received day treatment for a while, but once his\ncondition stabilized he was sent back to his public school\nclassroom. There, according to the report, ``he fell apart.'' He\nwas ostracized by classmates. He placed a Molotov cocktail in the\ntailpipe of a car belonging to a teacher he disliked.\n\n   The boy was hospitalized several times and received residential\ntreatment for a while. But eventually he was sent home. The report\nsaid he no longer attends school, is not receiving clinical support\nand no longer gets medication. And there is no plan for ongoing\nmental health treatment.\n\n   Here's a surprise: The youngster has been in trouble with the\npolice.\n\n   In November, Pataki announced plans to spend an additional $36.2\nmillion on mental health residential and support services for\nchildren. Advocates like Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of\nthe Citizens Committee for Children, have generally been pleased by\nthe initiative. But they said it is not nearly enough to offset the\nmany years of neglect and chronic underfunding of children's mental\nhealth services.\n\n   So, for example, in addition to the long waits for admittance to\nresidential treatment facilities, there are drastic shortages of\nother mental health services for children because of arbitrary\nMedicaid spending caps and other harmful cost-cutting measures\nimposed by the state.\n\n   ``It means there are many, many kids who don't get things like\noutpatient therapy, medication, crisis services, day treatment or\npartial hospitalization,'' Ms. Nayowith said. ``We like what the\ngovernor did in November. But we want the state to build on that\n$36.2 million foundation.''\n\n   The suffering of mentally ill children who do not get treatment\ncan be overwhelming.\n\n   ``They've got voices telling them what to do,'' said Ms.\nNayowith. ``They've got hallucinations. They have anxiety\ndisorders, which means they can never sit and relax, or\nobsessive-compulsive disorders _ hand-washing, pacing. They have\nphobias and horrible eating disorders. Some are cutters _ you know,\nthey mutilate themselves.\n\n   ``What happens with these kids is that they suffer from an\nillness that has a treatment but, basically, they're denied\ntreatment. So they're not getting relief from their pain. It would\nbe as if your kid had asthma or diabetes and you just never\nprovided an inhaler or insulin.''\n\n   The price paid by others for not treating these kids can be\nextreme. Ms. Nayowith mentioned the youngsters who are very\naggressive sexually, who are subject to uncontrollable anger or\nmania, who physically attack others, set fires, mutilate animals.\nThe violence, at times, is homicidal.\n\n   Ms. Nayowith also noted that mentally ill youngsters frequently\nare the victims of sexual assault.\n\n   A close look at the tragic plight of the many thousands of\nmentally ill children in New York should convince anyone that bold\nnew steps need to be taken to alleviate the gruesome psychic pain\nthat these youngsters experience, and to lessen the threat that\ntheir illness can pose to the rest of us.\n","Headline":"\nCOMMENTARY: WHEN TREATMENT IS DENIED \n","Text":["\n   The Legal Aid Society has sued the state to try to force it to\nprovide residential treatment for severely mentally ill children\nwho now are on waiting lists and languish in inappropriate settings\nfor months, sometimes more than a year.\n","\n   But the shortage of residential treatment facilities is just\npart of a much larger crisis in the delivery of services to\nthousands upon thousands of mentally ill children who are suffering\ngrievously, and who often are a threat to themselves or others.\n","\n   Gov.
