A copy has also been sent to entertainment\nwires.) \nBy EVAN HENERSON \nc.2000 Los Angeles Daily News \n\n     \nLining the walls of the Every Picture Tells a Story gallery for the\nnext month are drawings that could as easily be attached to a\nrefrigerator door or tacked to a proud parent's office cubicle.\nThey bear the distinct mark of a child's imagination and\ncreativity.\n\n   Except the subjects are hardly childlike.\n\n   You won't see an abundance of sun, rainbows or houses _ images\nthat typically dominate art by children. Occasionally, the faces\nwill be smiling. More often, not. A clay modeled hand is covered\nwith pins. In a crayon and charcoal drawing, the haunted-eyed face\nof a single flower grows out of a pile of rocks. In another crayon\ndrawing, a stick figure adult rescues a child following the bombing\nof the federal building in Oklahoma City.\n\n   The artists' names aren't revealed. We only learn their age,\ngender and the element of their lives that makes their stories more\ncomplicated.\n\n   The young artists featured in ``Childhood Revealed: Art\nExpressing Pain, Discovery and Hope,'' suffer from learning\ndisabilities, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, depression and\nschizophrenia. Some have been victims of divorce; others have\nsuffered physical and sexual abuse.\n\n   And, just like children who have never experienced trauma or\nmental illness, these painters and sculptors _ ages 4 to 18 _ have\nfound a way to express themselves through art.\n\n   ``Everybody knows that children's artwork is beautiful,'' says\nDr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the New York University Child\nStudy Center. ``You can be psychiatrically ill and still be a\nchild. That's what this is all about.''\n\n   The exhibition will be at the Los Angeles gallery through July\n30 before continuing a national tour through the end of 2001.\nProceeds from the exhibition and from an accompanying coffee table\nbook _ co-edited by Koplewicz and Dr. Robin Goodman _ will benefit\nresearch at the Child Study Center.\n\n   During its stay, the art _ which includes water color drawings,\ncollages and sculpture _ will educate, and, Koplewicz hopes,\nenlighten those who see it. The images may disturb people as well,\nbut as Child Study Center officials note, there's nothing pretty\nabout mental illness.\n\n   More than 10 million children and teens in the United States\nsuffer from mental health problems such as depression, eating\ndisorders, learning disabilities and anxiety, but only a fraction\nhave been diagnosed and receive treatment. Exhibitions like\n``Childhood Revealed'' help give these children and their\nafflictions some much-needed recognition.\n\n   ``We're dealing with an issue that we don't think gets talked\nabout enough, and dealing with some brutal subjects,'' says Brein\nLopez, Every Picture's curator. ``There's a tendency for adults to\njust sort of stay away from emotional issues, but I think it's very\nimportant that we allow ourselves to see that kids do deal with\nthese types of emotions on a daily basis.''\n\n   This isn't the usual fare for Every Picture Tells a Story, which\ntypically displays art from children's books. But gallery officials\nhad recently been studying the works and career of Friedl\nDicker-Brandeis, a woman who pioneered art therapy techniques\nduring the Holocaust, and the subject of a future exhibition. They\nconcluded that the ``Childhood Revealed'' exhibition was a perfect\nfit after all.\n\n   ``With art being banned from schools over the last 12 years,\nwe're losing our ability to experience art on a daily basis,'' said\nLopez. ``When art is used as a way for kids to relate to their\nsurroundings and emotions, it's a good thing.''\n\n   More than 700 pieces of artwork _ all submitted anonymously by\nthe children's teachers, counselors and therapists _ were entered\nfor consideration in the exhibition. A jury of teachers, artists\nand educators, including New Yorker art critic Paul Goldberger _\nmade the final selection for ``Childhood Revealed.''\n\n   But as revealing as the artwork may seem, Koplewicz cautions\nexhibition visitors to refrain from becoming amateur clinicians\nafter looking at the pictures.\n\n   ``The works themselves are not diagnostic. It would be\ninappropriate and unsafe to interpret what they mean.'' says\nKoplewicz. ``A child who doesn't have the same disorder can do the\nsame work. Some of them are just beautiful pieces of art.''\n\n   In many cases, however, the artists themselves provide a window\nof interpretation via an extended caption. Under his acrylic and\nwatercolor titled ``Breaking Through,'' a 15-year-old boy with\nbipolar disorder writes: ``In this painting I am portraying myself\non the dark side and other people on the light side. There is a\nchain in the middle because I used to put up an emotional wall and\ndid not let others help me. I used drugs for help instead. Well,\nnow the chain is broken and I let others help. I am not alone\nanymore.''\n\n   Since opening at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York\nlast November, ``Childhood Revealed'' has spawned several tie-in\nevents. Local medical facilities have sponsored forums on mental\nhealth and, in certain cases, have brought in celebrities who\nsuffered from various forms of illness or physical disabilities as\nchildren. Katie Couric wrote the forward to the book, which also\nincludes a paragraph from Ted Kennedy Jr. A few of the artists have\neven broken their anonymity, appearing at functions to talk about\ntheir works.\n\n   ``We want to educate America about these disorders, and\nhopefully we can leave something behind,'' says Koplewicz. ``It's\nnot that the New York University Child Study Center is coming to\nCalifornia.
