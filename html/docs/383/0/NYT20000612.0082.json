A Delta Airlines executive told a Senate\ncommittee last month that Delta actually saved money by expanding\nits mental health coverage.\n\n   But any talk about making health plans include ``mental health''\nin the broader category of ``health'' are invariably met by\nhysterical opposition from business organizations and the insurance\nindustry. These are two of the most powerful interest groups that\ncontrol congressional puppet strings, so their opposition\ntranslates to ``Shut up!'' even though one in five Americans suffer\na mental illness every year.\n\n   The value of employer-provided health care benefits declined by\n55 percent from 1988 to 1998, according to the Hay Group, an\nactuary and benefits consultant, while other health-care benefits\ndropped by only 11.5 percent. Providers' payments for mental health\ncare dropped 36 percent.\n\n   While benefits were falling, the need for them was growing. The\nNational Association of Psychiatric Health Systems reported\ndouble-digit increases in hospital patients from 1996 to '97 alone,\nincluding 69 percent rise in outpatient service.\n\n   The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, passed as a first-step\nsolution, was more a stumble off the curb. It required health plans\nfunded directly by employers to use the same dollar limits for\nmental health coverage as for other health coverage. But the U.S.\nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) says that one in seven companies\nbreak that law and most evade it, often by restricting numbers of\ndays or visits.\n\n   Full mental health parity would add 1.4 percent to an employer's\nhealth costs, according to the National Institute of Mental Health\n(NIMH), or 2 percent to 4 percent by GAO estimates. But those\nfigures would be offset by the increased productivity of a mentally\nhealthy workforce. The NIMH estimates mental illnesses cost\nbusinesses $148 billion altogether last year.\n\n   ``Mental illness costs society about as much as cancer or heart\ndisease,'' says Terry Russell, executive director of NAMI Ohio, and\namong those urging increased state mental health funding.\n\n   The most reasonable argument against mental health parity is\nthat psychiatric and psychological treatment is an inexact science\nwithout precise timetables. It's a lot like cancer treatment, in\nother words. But cancer doesn't have the 80 percent success rate of\nclinical depression and the cost of treating it doesn't come close\nto paying for itself in productivity.\n\n   Any difference between mental and other illnesses has been blown\naway by new imaging technology. It shows distinct physical changes\nin the brain associated with mental disorders and their treatment.\nYet of two chronic, incurable, dopamine-based diseases, most health\nplans cover Parkinson's fully and schizophrenia partly.\n\n   Nor is there any doubt that mental disorders are a contributing\ncause of practically everything from broken hips to heart attacks.\nA 10-year study published this year in the ``Annals of Behavioral\nMedicine `` found that treating depression patients reduced their\ntotal use of medical service. In another study, heart patients with\ndepression were 72 percent more likely to have large reductions in\nmedical costs if the depression was treated.\n\n   When presidential candidate Al Gore proposed full mental health\nparity for children two weeks ago, the vice president's policy\ncoordinator was asked about polls on the subject. Policy\ncoordinators like to see polling data before ordering dinner,\nremember, but she said this issue was too important for that.\n\n   Long before that announcement, the National Mental Health\nAssociation graded Gore with an A-minus and his opponent, George W.\nBush, an F-plus. The grades were based on 10 categories and not\njust Bush's fondness for executing the mentally ill, one of whom\nwanted his last meal a day after his execution.\n\n   Gore knows that mental health parity is a tough sell at a time\nwhen people talk casually about urinary incontinence and erectile\ndysfunction but not mental illness. His only hope is that\ninformation can bury the stigma that keeps people out of treatment\nand out of work.\n\n   ``The more people learn about mental and emotional disorders,\nthe more they understand it has to be on a par with (other)\nillnesses,'' says Gore's wife, Tipper, a former patient. ``I think\nthat knowledge and information replace fear and misunderstanding.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's hard to imagine how companies without the\nsense to give mental health full parity in their insurance plans\nare smart enough to stay in business.\n","\n   The evidence is overwhelming that money spent treating mental\ndisorders winds up reducing other medical expenses and increasing\nworkplace productivity.
