Times News Service    \n\n   PHOENIX _ A dozen years after the national alarm over crack\nhastened the decline of drug treatment in favor of punitive laws\nthat helped create the world's largest prison system, anti-drug\npolicy is taking another turn. Treatment is making a comeback,\ndriven largely by a grass-roots revolt.\n\n   Arizona has taken the boldest step. In defiance of the state's\npolitical establishment, voters took the law into their own hands\nand voted twice, by large majorities, to make Arizona the first\nstate to mandate treatment instead of prison for criminal offenders\nwhose primary legal problem is drug use.\n\n   At least 40 states have set up drug courts to steer offenders\ntoward treatment instead of jail. A number of states are\nconsidering changing their mandatory prison laws for drug\noffenders, most notably New York, which was the first to require\nlong sentences for possession of small amounts of drugs 26 years\nago.\n\n   In the crack years of the 1980s, treatment programs were gutted\nwhile the drug-fighting budget quadrupled. News reports said crack\nwas the most addictive substance known to man, and prisons started\nto fill with people who once might have gotten help instead. The\nnumber of Americans locked up on drug offenses grew from 50,000 in\n1980 to 400,000 today.\n\n   Yet even during the height of the prison boom, when some people\nwere sentenced to life behind bars for possessing small amounts of\na drug, a number of treatment centers continued to have success.\n\n   While not all addicts respond to treatment, these programs\nshowed that crack was less addictive than some other street drugs,\nor even nicotine, and that many of its users responded to\nconventional group therapy. Habitual users of crack, according to a\nfive-year federal survey of treatment published last year, showed\ngreater success at staying clean than alcoholics.\n\n   Some of the experts who called crack the worst drug of all have\ndone an about face.\n\n   ``I've changed my view because of the data that has come in over\nthe last 10 years,'' said Dr. Charles O'Brien, chief of psychiatry\nat the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia, who\nin the late '80s described crack as ``by far, the most addictive\ndrug we've ever had to deal with.''\n\n   What changed his mind were national surveys that showed 84\npercent of people who tried cocaine _ either smoking it as crack or\ninhaling it in powder form _ did not become addicted. He said he\nhad also been swayed by a study he co-wrote of habitual users of\ncrack who were assigned to treatment. A year after treatment, at\nleast half tested free of drugs.\n\n   Locking up crack users is still the policy in the federal\nsystem. But in Arizona, the same crack user prosecuted under state\nlaws cannot be sent to prison. Instead, he must undergo drug\ntreatment. The money for treatment comes from the offenders\nthemselves and from a tax on liquor.\n\n   Many states have adopted similar policies by establishing drug\ncourts, which sentence people to treatment as a way to keep them\nout of jail. Started in Miami by judges and prosecutors frustrated\nby the conveyer-belt justice of the war on drugs, these courts have\ngrown from a handful at the start of the decade to nearly 600\nnationwide. More than 90,000 people have been sent to treatment\nthrough drug courts.\n\n   Where basic state laws on mandatory sentences for a host of drug\ncrimes have not changed, in many cases it is prosecutors who have\ndiscretion to send offenders to treatment, instead of filing\ncharges that could lead to jail time.\n\n   While critics say the drug courts coddle chronic abusers who\nbelong in jail, the cost savings have won over many others.\nTreatment instead of prison saves about $20,000 per person\nannually, according to a study last year by the National Center on\nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.\n\n   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of national drug policy, has\nbecome a promoter of drug courts, saying they ``constitute one of\nthe most monumental changes in social justice in this country since\nWorld War II.'' After three years as the drug czar, McCaffrey has\nconcluded that treatment is the best way to reduce drug use.\n\n   The Clinton administration has increased financing for treatment\nby 17 percent over the last four years. But President Clinton's\ndrug-fighting budget, at $18 billion, the biggest in history, still\ndirects nearly two-thirds of the money to enforcement and\ninterdiction of the drug supply, a proportion unchanged since the\nReagan administration. Treatment will get about $3 billion from the\nbudget.\n\n   According to the General Accounting Office, the research arm of\nCongress, 70 percent of the people sent to drug courts successfully\ncomplete treatment. People who are sent to prison instead of\ntreatment are four times as likely to commit another drug crime\nwithin five years of release, the report found.\n\n   Arizona might seem an odd state to turn the table on American\ndrug policy. Its voters are generally conservative and definitely\nnot soft on crime. For years, the state's imprisonment rate has\nranked among the top. And under the state's basic drug laws, it is\na felony to possess even the smallest amount of drugs like\nmarijuana.\n\n   In the last five years, the prison population has ballooned by\n50 percent, to 26,000. State officials say drug and alcohol abuse\nare at the root of the crimes of about 75 percent of the inmates,\nmatching national surveys.\n\n   Arizona used to proclaim zero tolerance toward drugs. But in\n1996, retired millionaire Joseph Sperling started a political\nrockslide that is still sending down stones. Sperling, who is 78\nand calls himself a lifetime student of British empiricism and\neconomic history, made his fortune by building a university system\nfor profit and then taking public the company that ran the system,\ncalled Apollo. But he was not ready to retire.\n\n   ``As a social scientist, I thought the drug war was one of the\nmost disastrous public policies I'd ever encountered,'' he said.\n``Three years ago, I was talking with some Arizona politicians, and\nI said, `We ought to reform the drug laws.'''\n\n   Joined by philanthropist George Soros, who has spent millions of\ndollars on efforts to overturn drug laws in several states,\nSperling became a principal financial backer of a 1996 initiative\nto change Arizona's drug laws, Proposition 200.\n\n   nn\n\n   Virtually the entire Arizona political establishment, the press\nand major national anti-drug leaders campaigned against Proposition\n200. Its most controversial part could have made drugs like heroin,\nLSD or marijuana legal for medical purposes when prescribed by two\ndoctors.\n\n   But a less-discussed provision mandated treatment insead of\nprison for certain nonviolent offenders, mainly criminals whose\ncore problem was drug addiction.\n\n   Proposition 200 passed by a 2-1 margin. Then the state\nLegislature amended the measure, saying voters had committed a\ngrave error. But then supporters of the original initiative put it\nup for another statewide vote in 1998 and again it passed, with a\n57 percent majority.\n\n   ``It was a dirty little secret that most people understood _ the\ndrug war had failed,'' Sperling said. ``The people were way ahead\nof the politicians on this.''\n\n   The part of the law that allowed doctors to prescribe major\ndrugs has been effectively halted by federal restrictions on the\nmedical use of such drugs. But the treatment provision was quietly\nput to work more than two years ago, and early results show that\nthree-fourths of the people who complete treatment test clean for\ndrugs afterward.\n\n   Richard Nixon was the first president to declare a ``war on\ndrugs,'' but he also directed about two-thirds of all federal\nanti-drug money at treatment and prevention with great success, as\nmeasured by sharp drops in crimes committed by drug addicts.
