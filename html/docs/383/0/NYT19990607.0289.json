GORE SAYS\n      By SCOTT SHEPARD\n      c.1999 Cox News Service\n\n   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore hosted the first-ever White House\nconference on mental health Monday, continuing her own recovery\nfrom depression as she aided the Clinton administration's efforts\nto battle the stigma of mental illness.\n\n   With her husband, Vice President Al Gore, at her side, Mrs. Gore\nconvened the one-day conference with her first discussion in a\npublic forum of her own battle with depression following the\nlife-threatening injuries to her son in a car accident in 1989.\n\n   ``Mental illness is not just something that happens to other\npeople, somebody over there,'' she said. ``We have to realize that\nit happens in our American families, in our American communities,\nand that means it calls on a response from all of us.''\n\n   Mrs. Gore told the conference it was time to ``break the\nsilence'' about mental illness, the way it was with cancer and AIDS\nin previous decades, to encourage those suffering from mental\nhealth problems to seek help.\n\n   ``We must recognize mental illness for what it is _ it is an\nillness that can be treated, and it can be treated successfully,''\nshe said.\n\n   President Clinton used the conference to announce a $7.3 million\nstudy of mental illness by the National Institute of Mental Health.\nHe also ordered the 285 health plans used by federal employees to\ncover mental illness and substance abuse.\n\n   ``Thirty-six years ago, President Kennedy said we had to return\nmental health to the mainstream of American medicine,'' Clinton\nsaid. ``Thirty-six years ago he said it, and we're still waiting.''\n\n   The White House also announced a national training program for\nteachers to identify and help troubled children, an idea stemming\nfrom the recent student shootings in Colorado and Georgia.\n\n   The conference, held at Howard University in Washington, was\nlinked to more than 1,000 sites nationwide by satellite and\ninvolved five Cabinet secretaries and 20 members of Congress.\n\n   In recent interviews about her depression, Mrs. Gore has\ndeclined to discuss her symptoms or the treatment she underwent.\nBut Monday, she disclosed that she sought professional help after\nfriends told her, as she put it, ``I was not myself.''\n\n   The vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic\npresidential nomination, told the conference that the Gore family\nlearned from his wife's experience that ``when mental illness\nstrikes, it affects not only the person who is involved but the\nentire family.'' He said his family became ``much stronger'' as a\nresult of the experience, but did not elaborate.\n\n   Clinton, too, praised the Gores as examples of how to deal with\nmental illness in a family. And he added a political tone to the\nconference in observing that the Gores have done more than others\nin turning ``family values into real concrete improvement'' for\naverage Americans.\n\n   The presence of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the\nconference also highlighted the ever increasing importance of\npolitics in White House events. Mrs. Clinton, who said ``we should\ndo whatever it takes to remove the stigma from mental illness,'' is\npreparing to run for the U.S. Senate in New York.\n\n   In fact, the least political of the primary participants in the\nconference was Mrs. Gore, who has long championed the issue of\nmental illness, her interest in the subject stemming to her\nchildhood and her mother's periodic bouts with clinical depression.\n\n   ``I asked her to be my national adviser for mental illness\nbecause she knows more and cares more about this issue than anyone\nelse I personally know,'' the president said of Mrs. Gore, who does\nvolunteer work with the mentally ill and homeless in Washington and\nwho has two degrees related to family therapy.\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore hosted the first-ever White House\nconference on mental health Monday, continuing her own recovery\nfrom depression as she aided the Clinton administration's efforts\nto battle the stigma of mental illness.\n","\n   With her husband, Vice President Al Gore, at her side, Mrs. Gore\nconvened the one-day conference with her first discussion in a\npublic forum of her own battle with depression following the\nlife-threatening injuries to her son in a car accident in 1989.\n","\n   ``Mental illness is not just something that happens to other\npeople, somebody over there,'' she said. ``We have to realize that\nit happens in our American families, in our American communities,\nand that means it calls on a response from all of us.''\n","\n   Mrs. Gore told the conference it was time to ``break the\nsilence'' about mental illness, the way it was with cancer and AIDS\nin previous decades, to encourage those suffering from mental\nhealth problems to seek help.\n","\n   ``We must recognize mental illness for what it is _ it is an\nillness that can be treated, and it can be treated successfully,''\nshe said.\n","\n   President Clinton used the conference to announce a $7.3 million\nstudy of mental illness by the National Institute of Mental Health.\nHe also ordered the 285 health plans used by federal employees to\ncover mental illness and substance abuse.\n","\n   ``Thirty-six years ago, President Kennedy said we had to return\nmental health to the mainstream of American medicine,'' Clinton\nsaid. ``Thirty-six years ago he said it, and we're still waiting.''\n","\n   The White House also announced a national training program for\nteachers to identify and help troubled children, an idea stemming\nfrom the recent student shootings in Colorado and Georgia.\n","\n   The conference, held at Howard University in Washington, was\nlinked to more than 1,000 sites nationwide by satellite and\ninvolved five Cabinet secretaries and 20 members of Congress.\n","\n   In recent interviews about her depression, Mrs. Gore has\ndeclined to discuss her symptoms or the treatment she underwent.\nBut Monday, she disclosed that she sought professional help after\nfriends told her, as she put it, ``I was not myself.''\n","\n   The vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic\npresidential nomination, told the conference that the Gore family\nlearned from his wife's experience that ``when mental illness\nstrikes, it affects not only the person who is involved but the\nentire family.''
