Times News Service   \n\n   NEW ORLEANS _ Hair testing to detect illicit drug use, a\nprocedure already popular with at least 1,000 employers in the\nUnited States, is now being adopted by some schools, opening a new\nchapter in the continuing debate over the best way to keep\nadolescents from experimenting with drugs.\n\n   De la Salle High School here, which is affiliated with the\nBrothers of the Christian Schools, a Roman Catholic order, began\ntesting the hair of its 870 students in March 1998 in a pilot\nprogram sponsored by Psychemedics Corp., the leading hair-testing\ncompany. Five other Catholic schools in the New Orleans region have\nfollowed suit.\n\n   ``Our motivation is to provide a good place for kids to learn\nand develop,'' said Yvonne Gelpi, De la Salle's president, ``and if\nyou keep that in focus, it enables you do do the right thing.''\n\n   Parents seem relieved that the school has assumed some of the\nburden of keeping their children off drugs. And hair testing deters\ndrug use, some teachers say, by giving teen-agers an excuse to\nresist peer pressure.\n\n   ``It's very simple,'' said Joseph Hines, De la Salle's dean of\nstudents. `` `My school drug-tests me; I can't do it.' ''\n\n   Yet the federal government, which has set strict standards for\nurine testing, has not done so for hair tests because it has yet to\nbe convinced of their accuracy. And the American Civil Liberties\nUnion opposes random testing, whether or not someone is suspected\nof drug use.\n\n   ``We're always concerned about testing people who haven't done\nanything wrong,'' said Lewis Maltby, director of the employment\nrights office of the ACLU. Hair testing, Maltby said, ``is growing\nfast and that's what alarms us. The problem is easy to state: It\ndoesn't work. It's not reliable.''\n\n   Private schools can make drug tests a condition of enrollment\nwithout inviting lawsuits. But now two public high school\nprincipals in New Orleans want to test their students, too, raising\nthe prospect of a legal battle with national ramifications.\n\n   ``It is an invasion of privacy,'' said Joe Cook, executive\ndirector of the ACLU of Louisiana. ``What somebody's done over the\nlast 90 days without harming anyone is nobody's business.''\n\n   Harry Connick, the district attorney of Orleans Parish, which\nincludes New Orleans, argues that hair testing at school is\nconstitutional because it meets the criteria for protecting health\nand safety concerns stemming from drug use.\n\n   ``What's wrong with taking a piece of hair from your head?''\nConnick asked.\n\n   As he pointed out, drug tests of school athletes in Oregon and\nof students engaged in extracurricular activities in Indiana and\nArkansas have been upheld in court.\n\n   Raymond Kubacki Jr., president of Psychemedics, which is based\nin Cambridge, Mass., said 80 schools, mostly private, in 26 states\nwere using Psychemedics to test their students for drugs.\n\n   Hair testing is based on the premise that drugs ingested in the\nbody travel through the bloodstream and are deposited in hair\nfollicles roughly in proportion to the amount taken. Traces remain\nin the hair, disclosing how long the drugs have been used.\n\n   ``Think of it as rings of a tree,'' Kubacki said.\n\n   Since hair grows at the rate of a half-inch a month, the test\nuses the inch and a half closest to the scalp to detect drug use\nfor the last 90 days. A hair sample the diameter of a shoelace tip\nis clipped and sent to a laboratory, which liquefies the follicles\nto measure the presence of five drugs: marijuana, heroin, cocaine,\namphetamine and phencyclidine, or PCP.\n\n   Government researchers have raised questions about whether drug\nmolecules bind more to coarser black hair than to finer blond or\nbrownish hair, creating racial or gender disparities, and whether\npassive exposure to marijuana or other smoked drugs could produce a\nfalse positive.\n\n   ``It's not a matter of detecting it in hair but in interpreting\nwhat you find,'' said Michael Welch, a research chemist for the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. ``Experienced labs\ngenerally do a pretty good job of identifying what's in hair.''\n\n   But Welch added: ``It's potentially possible that people could\nhave detectable levels in their hair without ever using the drug. I\nthink it's going to take more research before these problems are\nresolved.''\n\n   Kubacki said Psychemedics used a patented method that\ndistinguished between external contamination and ingestion by\nthoroughly washing the hair sample beforehand and identifying not\njust the drug but also its metabolite, a substance produced by the\nbody's metabolism. Before the test, the process also extracts the\nmelanin, which gives hair its color, he said.\n\n   Tom Mieczkowski, a professor of criminology at the University of\nSouth Florida who specializes in the technology of drug testing,\nsaid hair testing was as accurate as urinalysis. Because bodily\nfluids like urine are excreted swiftly, Mieczkowski said, ``hair\ntesting is almost the only thing we have'' to gauge longer-term\ndrug use.\n\n   Hair testing is used by courts, police forces and other\nlaw-enforcement agencies. Connick, the district attorney, said his\noffice had been using the tests ``with excellent results'' to\nevaluate drug offenders for diversion into treatment programs.\n\n   ``It's a great method of detecting a history of drug use,'' he\nsaid. ``The larger time frame allows you to find out what the\ndefendant has been using.''\n\n   But his office supplements hair testing with urinalysis to learn\nwhether offenders have used drugs in the last day or so.\n\n   Rosemary Mumm, the diversionary-program director, said, ``That\ntells us they probably won't stop on their own.''\n\n   nn\n\n   When Psychemedics offered a year's free hair testing for two\nschools in New Orleans, De la Salle High School accepted, followed\nby St. Augustine High School. De la Salle sends more than 90\npercent of its students to college. But it had enough of a problem\nthat teen-agers jokingly called the school ``De la Drugs.''\n\n   The reputation was unwarranted, Ms. Gelpi said, but she assumed\nthat some youngsters were trying drugs.\n\n   ``If it's nationwide, it's in our city,'' said Ms. Gelpi, who\nfunctions as chief executive officer of the school. ``If it's in\nour city, it's in our schools. We've got to take some big steps to\nget away from drugs.''\n\n   De la Salle's principal, Brother Jeffrey Callaghan, told a\npacked meeting of parents in December 1997 that the school wanted\nto start testing their children.\n\n   ``It's the only standing ovation I've ever received at a\nparents' meeting,'' Callaghan said.\n\n   Before Christmas vacation that year, he warned the students that\nhair testing would start the following March, giving them three\nmonths to stop any drug use.\n\n   Ruth Janes, a junior at the time, said, ``Girls really flipped\nout, because they thought they were going to have their hair cut.''\nPanic subsided once they learned that the hair taken would be\ncosmetically inconspicuous.\n\n   ``My mom and dad thought it was great,'' said Ms. Janes, 18.\n``They didn't have a problem with privacy, and it was one less\nthing they had to worry about because the school was doing it.''\n\n   Her classmate Christian Moises, 17, wore his hair cropped so\nshort that Hines, the dean of students, had to apply scissors to\nthe young man's leg to collect enough body hair.\n\n   ``It wasn't that big a deal,'' Christian said. ``I have nothing\nto hide, so it doesn't bother me one way or the other.''\n\n   Christian's mother, Jennifer Moises, said she had mixed feelings\nat first because of the privacy issue. ``I felt confident that my\nson would pass it,'' Mrs. Moises said, ``but I also felt sorry for\nthe parents whose children failed the test.''\n\n   But most parents, she said, ``thought it was a very good idea\nand couldn't understand why it hadn't been done before.''\n\n   With three months' notice, only 28 of De la Salle's 870 students\ntested positive for drugs.\n\n   ``If you'd asked me what it would have been,'' Ms. Gelpi said,\n``I'd have said much higher.''\n\n   Individual results were released only to parents of students who\ntested positive, and the students were quietly referred for drug\ncounseling. When the students who failed were retested several\nmonths later, only three, all white females, failed. This year, 12\nstudents tested positive. Three others transferred to different\nschools rather than be tested.\n\n   Students are now tested at least once a year, at an annual,\nper-student cost of about $55, which has been added to De la\nSalle's tuition.\n\n   ``What parent wouldn't pay $55 to know that their child is\ndrug-free?'' Ms. Gelpi asked.\n\n   Now Vincent Nzinga, the principal of Frederick Douglass High\nSchool, a public school whose 1,300 students are overwhelmingly\nblack and often poor, wants them tested, too.\n\n   ``The vast majority of them want to go somewhere, they want to\nbe somebody,'' Nzinga said. ``I want to give them all the\nadvantages I can.''\n\n   He has petitioned the Orleans Parish School Board to permit drug\ntesting, and the board will decide this summer.\n\n   ``I don't believe we need to sweep any problem under the rug,''\nNzinga said. ``If there's a problem, what people want to know is\nthat we're doing something about it.''\n\n   Alcee Fortier High School, another public school in New Orleans,\nalso wants hair testing for drugs.\n\n   The ACLU will challenge drug testing in New Orleans public\nschools as a violation of protections against unreasonable search\nand seizure and invasion of privacy in both the U.S. Constitution\nand the Louisiana constitution, said Cook, the ACLU executive\ndirector in Louisiana.\n\n   But Connick, the district attorney, said that if parents\napproved, hair testing should be extended to every public school in\nNew Orleans.\n\n   ``They have enough problems educating students,'' he said, ``but\nthe problem is magnified because of drugs.''\n","Headline":"\nSOME SCHOOLS HAIR-TESTING STUDENTS FOR DRUG USE \n","Text":["\n   NEW ORLEANS _ Hair testing to detect illicit drug use, a\nprocedure already popular with at least 1,000 employers in the\nUnited States, is now being adopted by some schools, opening a new\nchapter in the continuing debate over the best way to keep\nadolescents from experimenting with drugs.\n","\n   De la Salle High School here, which is affiliated with the\nBrothers of the Christian Schools, a Roman Catholic order, began\ntesting the hair of its 870 students in March 1998 in a pilot\nprogram sponsored by Psychemedics Corp., the leading hair-testing\ncompany.
