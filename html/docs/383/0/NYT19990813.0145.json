Although she no doubt understands a\nmother's desire to save her son, she takes issue with people who\nwant to discount the decisions made by 24 jurors who agonized over\nall the testimony and evidence before rejecting the defense\nstrategy of Robison's mental illness.\n\n   ``Robison was never diagnosed as mentally ill until after he\ncommitted these murders, and then only by defense expert witnesses\nas a defense tactic,'' Estes wrote in a letter rebutting recent\nStar-Telegram columns by Molly Ivins and Bob Ray Sanders that\ncalled for mercy.\n\n   Estes says that through court testimony it was learned that\nRobison in fact was institutionalized, even jailed, on several\noccasions, but it was for illegal drug use, not schizophrenia.\n``Robison's defense attorneys selected a defense other than `a\ndrug-induced killing spree,' which didn't help Karla Faye Tucker.''\n\n   You'll remember that Tucker was executed last year for her part\nin a grisly 1983 pick-ax murder. Her defense strategy of ``I didn't\nknow what I was doing because of the drugs I took'' didn't cut it\nwith her jury.\n\n   Robison admitted to using LSD, amphetamines, marijuana,\ntranquilizers, PCP and other illegal drugs.
