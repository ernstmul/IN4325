GONZALEZ \nc.1999 Houston Chronicle \n \n\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after Texas penitentiaries were described\nas among the nation's most horrific, a state official testified\nFriday that the prison system fully complies with a 1992 federal\ncourt order governing mental-health care for inmates.\n\n   And two Texas prison units have passed a national group's\ninspection with flying colors, becoming the first in the state to\nwin prestigious accreditation of the American Correctional\nAssociation, an inspector said.\n\n   The upbeat testimony before senior U.S. District Judge William\nWayne Justice was aimed at offsetting the claims of inmates and\ntheir hired experts that Texas prisons fail to properly treat\nmentally-ill prisoners and routinely violate their civil rights\nwith a variety of unconstitutional prison conditions.\n\n   Dr. Suzanne Ducate, director of mental health services for the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, which provides\nmedical care to inmates, said the state meets Justice's 1992\nrequirements. The official said Texas gives inmates full access to\nmental-health care; enforces work limitations for ailing inmates;\nand won accreditation for all three mental-health units from the\nNational Council for Correctional Health Care.\n\n   Ducate said the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which also\ncontracts with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center for\nmedical services, has developed sufficient policies and procedures\nto assure high-quality care for the state's 140,000 inmates. She\nsaid there's also an intense effort to find qualified health-care\npersonnel and train security officers to identify mental illness.\n\n   Ducate said the state's conversion in 1994-96 to a managed care\nsystem for inmates has produced ``a greater emphasis on wellness,''\nwith patients being treated as early as possible for their\nailments. And while she acknowledged that the high cost of\nmedication is an ever-present concern, the psychiatrist said the\nstate does make use of cutting edge anti-psychotic drugs and also\nis in the forefront of tele-psychiatry _ which uses closed-circuit\ntelevisions to link far-flung inmates and prison doctors.\n\n   ``You feel as if you're in the same room as the patient,'' said\nDucate, who from her home can treat inmates more than 500 miles\naway in Fort Stockton.\n\n   The official said an elaborate system of checks and balances is\nin place to assure proper treatment, though problems persist. One\nfemale inmate recently died as a result of improper psychiatric\ncare, and scrutiny of the treating doctor's actions led to his\nfiring.\n\n   ``I felt that the care was definitely substandard,'' Ducate\nsaid.\n\n   She added that one of the system's problems is inmates' refusal\nto consent to transfer to prison mental-health units from regular\nunits. Consequently, inmates with various mental illnesses\nsometimes languish in solitary-confinement cells and exhibit the\nkind of bizarre behavior that inmates' experts testified about\npreviously.\n\n   Justice, obviously intrigued about why inmates in solitary\nconfinement would smear themselves with their own feces, urinate on\ntheir cell floors, mutilate themselves and exhibit other strange\nbehavior, pressed Ducate for explanations.\n\n   The doctor said some of the actions could be signs of bonafide\nmental illness, warranting their housing in mental-health units.\nBut she noted that other federal-court rulings guarantee inmates\nthe right to refuse psychiatric treatment. Furthermore, some of the\nobnoxious behavior may be reasonable responses to confinement;\ncalculated to win attention or designed to gain a new housing\nassignment.\n\n   ``It does work in many instances,'' Ducate said, adding, ``these\nare very difficult people to treat.''\n\n   The judge, curious about the doctor's opinion on whether\nlong-term solitary confinement was ``conducive to mental health,''\ngot this reply: ``I would have to say `no.''' But Ducate added that\none of the saddest things about her job is being unable to convince\nsome troubled inmates to transfer from solitary confinement to\nin-patient psychiatric units.\n\n   The doctor took issue with an inmate expert's claim that\nnumerous solitary-confinement prisoners visited in a 1998\ninspection displayed true mental illness. She said her own team's\nexamination of the inmates found only one in need of a transfer.\n\n   ``I want to insure no one is under-treated or misdiagnosed,''\nDucate emphasized.\n\n   Earlier Friday, an Illinois-based consultant who conducts\ninspections for the American Correctional Association said he was\npleasantly surprised by the conditions he saw in the Eastham and\nRobertson units, which won accreditation last month. He admitted he\nwasn't anxious to visit the units because he had heard from other\nprofessionals that Texas prisons had ``significant problems,'' and\nthat Texas officials ``actively opposed the ACA (accreditation)\nprocess.''\n\n   But the units scored 100 on all mandatory categories, including\nuse-of-force issues, and reached the 95 score required for\nnon-mandatory standards, the inspector said.\n\n   ``When I left Robertson (near Abilene), I was very pleased with\nwhat I saw,'' said consultant David Sandahl. ``I was equally\nimpressed at Eastham (near Lovelady) because that's an old joint.''\n\n   Under questioning by inmates' lawyers, however, Sandahl conceded\nthat the three-day inspections were in some ways superficial and\ndependent on case files offered by prison officials. Justice, too,\nsuggested that such an inspection could be like those in the\nmilitary, when everyone knows it's coming and have time to prepare\nfor it.\n\n   But Sandahl said that doesn't make the inspections meaningless.\nHe said they help officials set goals, pull staff together, and in\nTexas' case, caused some inmates to say they hoped other units will\nseek accreditation because of the changes the process prompted.\n\n   Justice plans to take testimony on behalf of inmates and the\nstate through next week before deciding whether to retain his\noversight over the prison system.
