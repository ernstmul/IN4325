Times News Service   \n\n   Schizophrenia produces headlines when a tormented mind produces\nan act of violence that is often described as senseless or random.\nBut the violence has its reasons, churning in brains afflicted by\ndelusions of threat or persecution or superiority. ``The Shattered\nMind'' offers hope in new generations of psychotropic drugs that\ncannot cure the ailment but can subdue its outbreaks while\nscientists strive for a better understanding of the workings or\nmisworkings of the brain.\n\n   By the estimate of Friday night's A&E documentary, some 2\nmillion people have schizophrenia, about 10 percent of them\npotentially violent. Most don't acknowledge their illness, and even\nthose who do may not take medication for it. Dire case histories\nare featured, such as the young man, in and out of mental\ninstitutions, on drugs and off, who ran a souvenir sword through\nhis mother's body, killing her. A psychiatrist suggests that he\nstruck out in what he believed was self-defense.\n\n   Although some psychiatrists maintain that schizophrenia should\nbe treated by therapy and that drugs can further damage the brain,\nthe program reports that ``the overwhelming majority of\npsychiatrists'' now put their faith in medication. Instead of\ntracing the illness to a patient's family in a traditional\npsychoanalytic approach, they are more inclined to see the family\nas an asset in making sure that the patient takes his medicine.\n\n   First-person testimony to the delusions of schizophrenia come in\nparticular from a Long Island man who had a breakdown while an art\nstudent. He tells of believing he was King Tut, throwing bottles\nand phones through windows and spending time in jails and mental\nwards. Now on medication, he can laugh about his past disturbances\nand evidently confines his hallucinations to his canvases.\n\n   Bill Kurtis, the host of ``Investigative Reports,'' discerns a\n``unique style'' shining through his work. Viewers may differ about\nthe quality of the paintings, but if they offer a channel for\nemotions that once threatened his own life as well as others, even\nconnoisseurs are not likely to quibble.\n\n   PRODUCTION NOTES:\n\n   `INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS: The Shattered Mind'\n\n   A&E, Friday night at 9\n\n   Julianne Hill, producer; Debbie Morton, associate producer;\nDavid Huizenga, audio director.
