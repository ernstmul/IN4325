(lb) \n By ROBERT PEAR    \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Insurance companies and employers have found ways\nto get around a 1996 law that requires them to offer health-care\ncoverage for mental illness that is comparable to that for physical\nillness.\n\n   The law, the Mental Health Parity Act, was expected to make\nmental health care more readily available to millions of Americans,\nbut, experts on employee benefits and health policy say, it has not\ndone so.\n\n   Under the law, which took effect last January, group health\nplans may not set annual or lifetime dollar limits on a member's\nmental health care that are less than any such limits for general\nmedical and surgical services.\n\n   So, many group plans, fearing higher costs, have simply replaced\nthe dollar limits for mental health care with numerical limits on\noutpatient visits, treatment sessions or days in the hospital.\n\n   ``The day and visit limits wind up being more restrictive in\nsome cases than the dollar limits for which they substituted,''\nsaid Ronald Bachman, an actuary at the accounting firm of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. ``The net impact in these cases is to have\nless mental health coverage.''\n\n   Russ Newman, director of clinical practice issues at the\nAmerican Psychological Association, said this was ``definitely an\nunintended consequence'' of the 1996 law.\n\n   ``The whole purpose of the law,'' Newman said, ``was to stop\ndiscrimination against mental health services and against people\nwho need those services.''\n\n   Supporters of the legislation, led by Sen. Pete Domenici,\nR-N.M., and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., had hoped that it would\ncurb coverage disparities between mental and physical illnesses.\nThey said they would fight to broaden and strengthen the law next\nyear.\n\n   The mental health law is one of several recent health-care\ninitiatives that have fallen short of the sponsors' expectations.\nAnother 1996 law was intended to guarantee health insurance\ncoverage for people who change or lose their jobs. But people\ntrying to exercise their rights have often been stymied as insurers\nskirt the law by charging them premiums of $10,000 to $15,000 a\nyear _ far more than the standard rates for healthy people.\n\n   Mental health care was long relegated to second-class status\nunder private insurance policies, but in the last few years it has\nreceived more attention from employers, insurers and politicians.\n\n   For one thing, the stigma of mental illness is being erased as\nscientists find physiological causes for a number of mental\ndisorders. In addition, some employers now consider spending on\nmental health care a smart investment, on the ground that it\nfosters a productive work force.\n\n   Federal officials say that 6 million people have severe mental\ndisorders and that the nation spends $70 billion a year to treat\nmental illness of all kinds, not counting outlays for alcohol and\ndrug abuse.\n\n   Coverage of mental health care is considered a reasonably good\nindicator of the overall quality of a health insurance plan.\nStudies in several states suggest that the cost of ``parity'' for\nmental health services is minimal, increasing total health care\ncosts by less than 1 percent.\n\n   But group health plans _ the benefits for which may be designed\nby the employer, the insurer or both _ are typically distrustful of\ngovernment mandates in general and apprehensive about the costs for\na kind of care that they consider particularly vulnerable to abuse.\n\n   Richard Adams Jr., an expert on health benefits at Watson Wyatt\nWorldwide, a consulting concern that advises many large businesses,\nsaid: ``Many companies have converted the dollar limits on mental\nhealth benefits into limits on the number of visits or days that\nwill be covered. If they had a $1,000 annual limit on outpatient\nvisits, it may be replaced with a limit of 20 visits. If there was\na $10,000 annual maximum for inpatient mental health benefits,\nemployers may convert it to a limit of 20 days.''\n\n   Joan Esnayra, a 34-year-old graduate student with manic\ndepressive disorder, said her insurance plan previously had a limit\nof $750 a year on outpatient mental health services but recently\nreplaced it with an annual limit of 15 visits.\n\n   Ms. Esnayra, a former teaching assistant who receives her\ncoverage through the University of California at San Diego, said\nthis limit could make her new coverage just as inadequate as the\nold.\n\n   ``Mental illness can flare up unpredictably,'' she said. ``A\nperson with major mental illness may need more than 15 visits with\na doctor just to find the right mix of medications, and for the\nmost effective treatment you often need talk therapy as well as\npharmaceuticals.''\n\n   Mary Clark Jordan, a health benefits consultant at Hewitt\nAssociates, said, ``The average consumer would be hard pressed to\nfind an improvement in mental health benefits as a result of the\nchanges'' since 1996.\n\n   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said: ``The Mental Health Parity Act\nwas a significant step in the right direction, but it was not as\ncomprehensive as we wanted. The experience of the last two years\nshows that the law has substantial loopholes and that\ndiscrimination is still practiced.''\n\n   In addition to the change in the nature of the limits, some\nhealth plans set higher co-payments and deductibles for mental\nhealth care than for other medical services, a disparity allowed\nunder the 1996 law. In an interview, Wellstone said he would push\nnext year for legislation to require ``full parity,'' covering\nco-payments, deductibles and limits on hospital stays and\noutpatient visits.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Aides to Tipper Gore, a Clinton administration spokeswoman on\nmental health issues, said she favored such legislation. Mrs. Gore,\nwife of the vice president, has long championed the rights of\npeople with mental illness.\n\n   Group Health Inc. of New York, like many insurers, has revised\nsome of its mental health benefits in response to the 1996 law.\n\n   ``Annual and lifetime dollar limitations on mental health\nbenefits will be removed,'' the company said in a notice to\nsubscribers in its program for New York City government employees.\nBut it said, ``For outpatient care, the $900 annual maximum and the\n$1,800 lifetime maximum will be replaced with a limit of up to 30\nvisits per year and 60 visits per lifetime.''\n\n   Carmine Russo, director of GHI's program for New York City\nemployees, said the plan's mental health benefits were among the\nmost comprehensive offered anywhere. But Rep. Carolyn Maloney,\nD-N.Y., said, ``While this level of benefits may be in technical\ncompliance with the Parity Act, it clearly violates the spirit of\nthe law, which was intended to ensure that physical and mental\nillnesses would receive the same level of coverage.''\n\n   Hewlett-Packard Co. illustrates another way some businesses have\nresponded to the law. The company had a lifetime limit of $1\nmillion on medical benefits for any employee or dependent, and no\nmore than $300,000 of that amount could be spent on mental health\ncare.\n\n   ``We still have the lifetime ceiling of $1 million,'' said Paula\nWallace, the health benefits manager for Hewlett-Packard, ``but the\n$300,000 limit for mental health was eliminated. We now have a\nsingle lifetime limit of $1 million on physical and mental health\nbenefits combined, with no distinction between the two.''\n\n   Hewlett-Packard has not experienced the sharp increase in costs\nthat many employers fear. ``Our mental health costs have been\nstable through 1998,'' Ms. Wallace said, in part because the\ncompany uses managed-care techniques to make sure patients receive\nappropriate but not excessive services.\n\n   Alfonso Guida Jr., vice president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, an advocate for people with mental disorders, said the\napproach taken by Hewlett-Packard was ``consistent with the intent\nof the law.''\n\n   But ``many insurers and employers are taking steps to bypass the\nfederal law,'' Guida said, ``changing the structure of their\nbenefits to impose discriminatory inpatient and outpatient visit\nlimits in place of the previous spending caps.''\n\n   Nineteen states have laws that require the same or similar\nlevels of coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Some of the\nstate laws, going further than the federal law, prohibit insurers\nfrom setting higher deductibles or patient fees for mental health\ncare than for other medical services.\n\n   Bachman, the actuary at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said health-care\nplans often paid a smaller share of bills for mental treatment than\nfor other kinds of care. For example, he said, if a psychiatrist\nsubmits a $90 bill for psychotherapy, the plan may count only $50\nas an eligible expense and then may pay only 50 percent of that, or\n$25. In contrast, Bachman said, if a family practitioner submits a\nbill for $90, the insurer may pay 80 percent of that amount, or\n$72.\n\n   The 1996 law does not require employers to provide any mental\nhealth benefits, but most companies that offer health insurance to\nemployees do cover some mental health care.\n\n   An employer may obtain an exemption if it can show, with at\nleast six months of data, that compliance with the 1996 law has\ncaused an increase of 1 percent or more in the overall cost of its\nemployee health plan.
