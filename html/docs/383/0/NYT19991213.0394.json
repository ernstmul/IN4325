Times News Service   \n\n   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Harvard University is planning a sweeping\nupgrade of its mental health services, seeking to weave a better\nnet to catch psychologically vulnerable students, whose numbers,\nexperts say, seem to be mounting at campuses around the country.\n\n   A Harvard panel has recommended such steps as hiring more\ntherapists, extending counseling hours at the university's health\nservice, training faculty and residential tutors better on mental\nhealth problems and even setting aside ``safe spaces'' in\nuniversity buildings where students can find respite from crisis.\n\n   The plan, which began circulating internally last month and\nwhose summary is posted on the World Wide Web at\nwww.provost.harvard.edu is just beginning to go into effect, said\nHarvey V. Fineberg, the university provost, who is overseeing it.\n\n   It comes during a suicide-free, murder-free, generally\ncrisis-free year for Harvard. But that is just the time to put\npreventive measures in place, Fineberg said, because no one is\nfeeling defensive. In the last decade, Harvard, whose undergraduate\nand graduate students number about 18,000, has averaged about one\nsuicide a year, and was rocked by a murder-suicide in 1995.\n\n   ``Stress levels for students are high at Harvard,'' the report,\nbased on a year of widespread interviews and research, said.\n``Almost all deans of students expressed the belief that their\nschool presented the most stressful environment, and emphasized the\nincreasing fragility of students and apparent higher incidence of\ndepression and serious mental illness.''\n\n   In addition, it said, ``Across Harvard, the stigma of seeking\nhelp for emotional problems or mental health concerns is difficult\nfor students who are accustomed to performing at the highest\nlevels,'' and many are ``unwilling to confide in tutors and\nadvisers who may eventually write graduate school or job\nrecommendations.''\n\n   Dr. Paul Summergrad, chairman of the committee that produced the\nanalysis and plan said: ``It's an attempt to look at mental health\nand support services in a clinical and very broad university\ncontext. I'm not aware of another study that has done that.'' The\nbasic idea, he said, ``is to build an increasingly redundant set of\nservices so we can have multiple ways that we can help students\nenter care.''\n\n   The U.S. surgeon general's report on mental health released in\nWashington on Monday highlighted how common some mental disorders\nwere, Summergrad noted, and the Harvard report addresses, among\nother things, the need to help people make the tricky distinction\nbetween everyday problems and illness.\n\n   The Harvard report asks, for example: ``Is a student's inability\nto finish a paper due to poor study habits, an inappropriate choice\nof major, changing academic interests or obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder? Is difficulty living with roommates a cultural adjustment\nor a manifestation of social phobia? Is a change in behavior or\nappearance a struggle for a new sense of self or a reflection of\nincipient schizophrenia?''\n\n   Harvard officials said that for all the prestigious university's\nspecial pressures, they did not believe students here suffered from\nmore psychological problems than elsewhere. Rather, they and others\nsaid, there has seemed to be a general rise in recent years in\nmental health troubles among students.\n\n   ``What the research has shown in the last decade is that we're\nbeginning to see an increase in severe problems in college\nstudents,'' said Perry C. Francis, president-elect of the American\nCollege Counseling Association. That situation is happening in\npart, he and others said, because teenagers with psychiatric\ndisorders are getting better treatment and thus advancing more\noften to college.\n\n   ``Part of it, you could say, is due to modern psychiatric\nmedications that allow students to keep certain mental illnesses\nunder control,'' Francis said ``The rub, or the issue, is that\nyou're finding many colleges or universities ill-prepared to deal\nwith their students' mental health, or counseling is seen as just\nan add-on to student services.''\n\n   Dr. Heidi Levine, chairwoman of the commission on counseling and\npsychological services of the American College Personnel\nAssociation, attributed some of the increase in recognized mental\nillness on campus to improved diagnoses.\n\n   ``People are receiving treatments earlier,'' she said, often for\n``some things that maybe in the past we chalked up to adolescent\nmoodiness.''\n\n   Overall, ``people who in the past might never have been able to\ncome to college because of serious mental illness are now able to\ncome to campus,'' she said.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.))\n\n   Contributors to the Harvard report emphasized the simple\nstatistical fact that, as Fineberg put it, ``mental health problems\nare the prime area of vulnerability for young adults.''\n\n   Over recent years, said Dr. Michael Jellinek, chief of child\npsychiatry services at Massachusetts General Hospital and a\nprofessor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School,\n``there's been more and more attention paid to the mental health\nproblems of both college and graduate students.''\n\n   Research documents extensive eating disorders among college\nstudents, he said, and many other serious psychiatric illnesses\nappear around college age, from clinical depression to addictive\nbehaviors to schizophrenia.\n\n   ``The way I read the report,'' Jellinek said of the Harvard\nplan, ``it emphasized the notion of looking at every aspect of\ncollege life to make it more supportive,'' from how dormitories are\norganized to how resident counselors are trained.\n","Headline":"\nHARVARD BEGINS UPGRADING SERVICES TO SPOT MENTALLY   TROUBLED\nSTUDENTS  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Harvard University is planning a sweeping\nupgrade of its mental health services, seeking to weave a better\nnet to catch psychologically vulnerable students, whose numbers,\nexperts say, seem to be mounting at campuses around the country.\n","\n   A Harvard panel has recommended such steps as hiring more\ntherapists, extending counseling hours at the university's health\nservice, training faculty and residential tutors better on mental\nhealth problems and even setting aside ``safe spaces'' in\nuniversity buildings where students can find respite from crisis.\n","\n   The plan, which began circulating internally last month and\nwhose summary is posted on the World Wide Web at\nwww.provost.harvard.edu is just beginning to go into effect, said\nHarvey V.
