Good treatment provides tools, not excuses. If you\ngave a wastebasket to a family with trash all over the floor, can\nyou imagine someone saying you were excusing and encouraging the\nfamily's filth?\n\n   Rocker's insults of women, Japanese, foreigners, homosexuals,\nblacks and New Yorkers in Sports Illustrated last month were\ncontemptible and indefensible, compounded by his belligerent lack\nof contrition. He deserves the public condemnation he's getting.\nBut if anything about his comments betrayed a mental illness, it\nwasn't bigotry. Prejudice is sadly universal, based on people's\nsize, shape, age and motor skills if not race, ethnicity and sexual\norientation.\n\n   Publicly expressing these prejudices, however, could indicate a\nmental illness ``that affects your ability to control your actions\nor your ability to understand reality,'' psychiatrist Dr. Walter\nReich of George Washington University wrote online in Slate\nmagazine. But MLB's order had less a spirit of ``Let's get this guy\nsome help'' than of ``Let's punish this guy for staining our good\nname.''\n\n   The broader problem with baseball's action is that it presumes\nto police thoughts. The recent history of centrally prohibited\nthoughts has been one of death camps, not increased tolerance. Even\ntoday and even in churches, there are places where belief in the\nequality of women and gays is frowned on.\n\n   The medical problem here, Reich writes, is that bad people\naren't necessarily mad. ``The widespread tendency to turn to\npsychiatry when dealing with moral transgressions . . . damages not\nonly society but also psychiatry.''\n\n   The number of accepted psychiatric diagnoses rose from 60 in\n1952 to 410 in 1994, not in order to give lawyers more ways of\ngetting criminals off but to give doctors and therapists more\nspecific ways of treating disorders.\n\n   So ``rage disorder'' is diagnosed not so a person can say, ``I\ncan't help it,'' but so he can say, ``I can find out how to help\nit,'' by using new coping strategies and medication. Only by\nmanipulating these diagnoses with unconscionable cynicism do people\ntry to absolve a cad or criminal by citing ``lottery stress\ndisorder'' or ``gay panic.''\n\n   But people tend to mistake explanations for excuses, as Hillary\nClinton learned last year. When she attributed her husband's skirt\nchasing partly to family conflicts in his childhood, her\nexplanation was ridiculed as rationalization.\n\n   The fact that President Clinton sought pastoral counseling\ninstead of psychotherapy for his problem shows how thoroughly\nstigmatized is mental health treatment.\n\n   One of the fastest-growing diagnoses is\nattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, for which drug\nprescriptions from 1990 to 1995 nearly tripled, to one of every 30\nU.S. children from 5 through 18. It was wonderful that some people\nreceived badly needed help and dreadful that others received an\nunneeded crutch. ``Hundreds and perhaps thousands'' of well-to-do\nkids are converting questionable diagnoses into extra time for\ntaking college board tests, the Los Angeles Times reported this\nmonth.\n\n   When psychology is abused this way, it hurts kids who really\nhave ADHD by suggesting it's not really serious and by discouraging\neffective treatment. The criminal justice system has done the same\nthing to people with serious psychiatric disorders, so that we\nexecute people who couldn't grasp reality if it came with a handle,\nwhile at the same time indulging the defense of violent stalking\nbecause of ``Internet intoxication.''\n\n   Mental illness isn't a weakness. Using its science for excuses\ninstead of improvement is a weakness.\n\n   Kevin Lamb writes for the Dayton Daily News, Dayton, Ohio.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ Major League Baseball's order that repulsive\nAtlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker undergo psychological testing is\nnot just appalling because it's trying to cure bigotry the way the\nSoviets used to cure capitalism or individuality.\n","\n   The order also is shameful because it reinforces the bigoted\nmisconceptions that mental illness is a character weakness and that\npsychology is at odds with personal responsibility.\n","\n   Those myths underlie the stigma and insurance inequities that\nare primary reasons that most Americans with legitimate mental\ndisorders don't seek treatment, as Dr. David Satcher announced two\nmonths ago in the most significant U.S. Surgeon General's report\nsince the one saying tobacco was not a healthy vegetable.\n","\n   Mental illnesses, from anxiety disorders to schizophrenia, are\nnot moral flaws any more than diabetes, another disease of\nimbalanced body chemicals.\n","\n   And psychological treatment of mental disorders _ outside the\nhands of lawyers _ increases a person's responsibility instead of\nabsolving it.
