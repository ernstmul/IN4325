They begged the doctors to use\ntheir son's name.\n\n   The show does communicate some of the torment of psychosis, and\nthe anguish of families seeing the madness in their loved ones'\neyes, and hearing it in their bizarre tales.\n\n   ``Wonderland'' does not succumb to the romantic notion that\ninsanity is arbitrarily determined by society and that asylums are\nfilled with sane people, interrupted by mind-numbing psychiatric\ndrugs.\n\n   ``It is hard to describe, to someone who has never seen it, how\nterrible and intractable madness often is,'' anthropologist T.M.\nLuhrmann writes in ``Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American\nPsychiatry.''\n\n   Forget ``Wonderland.'' Luhrmann's book is hardly intended as\nentertainment, but she describes the insane and their doctors in\nmarvelous novelistic detail _ and she finds the humor Billy talked\nabout.\n\n   ``When psychosis is not brutally awful, it is funny, and\nsometimes looking for the humor in it makes it more possible to\nhandle the pain of seeing a human being lose his mind,'' she writes\nsorrowfully.\n\n   Luhrmann spent years doing field work in a variety of mental\ninstitutions, studying psychiatry the way an anthropologist would\nany culture.
