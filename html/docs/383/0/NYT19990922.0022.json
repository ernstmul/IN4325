Times News Service clients)  \n By CAROL SOWERS AND VICTORIA   \n Harker  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Five years after a convicted prostitute and her mentally\nretarded boyfriend were charged with killing her two small\nchildren, neither has gone to trial and they have lived in a\nMaricopa County jail longer than anyone else awaiting trial.\n\n   Loretta Greer, 32, and Brent Linner, 29, were charged in\nDecember 1994 with first-degree murder and child abuse in the\ndeaths of Henry, 5, and Odessa, 3, who police say were beaten with\ntennis rackets, drowned in a bathtub, wrapped in garbage bags and\npushed 10   feet down a sewer line under a manhole cover.\n\n   Five years ago this week, the children were discovered. They had\nbeen murdered up to four months earlier.\n\n   The grisly tale of the Greer children of Phoenix dominated the\nnews in late 1994 and raised questions once again about child\nwelfare in the state.\n\n   Now, after 30 postponements, Greer, who has a history of mental\nillness and drug addiction, is expected to be tried on Nov. 15, and\nLinner, diagnosed as severely retarded, is slated for trial Dec. 6.\n\n   Typically, homicide defendants go to court in two years.\n\n   Hundreds of pages of court records in the case document delays\ntypical of a court system that has been grappling with ways to move\ncriminal cases more rapidly.\n\n   The postponements were caused, in part, by a tangle of\nscheduling conflicts between prosecutors and defense attorneys who\nwere juggling multiple cases. There were also changes in judges\nscheduled to hear the case.\n\n   One woman, Paula Davey, who had herself appointed the victim\nadvocate for the dead children, is outraged over the delays.\n\n   ``I don't want these children to be forgotten,'' she said.\n\n   Court records show that Loretta Greer has been the architect of\nmany of the delays. In some instances, she has refused to go to\ncourt. She has dismissed two court-appointed attorneys, and she has\ndelayed her trial for two years by apparently faking symptoms of\nmental illness, according to court records.\n\n   From 1994 to 1996, Greer tried to convince court officials that\nshe was mentally incapable of assisting in her defense and should\nnot go to trial.\n\n   But in September 1996, Commissioner Carey Hyatt declared her\ncompetent to stand trial because she said Greer was ``intentionally\nproducing general or exaggerated psychological symptoms.''\n\n   Linner was declared fit to stand trial within a year after he\nwas charged with murder. Greer's demands also delayed Linner's\ntrial as they were originally to be tried together. The decision to\ntry them separately was made only recently.\n\n   Greer's bizarre behavior is a legend in the courthouse. In some\nappearances, she has yelled or hummed. Once, she had to be tied\ninto a wheelchair with a blanket.\n\n   ``She's very manipulative,'' said Luis Calvo, one of her fired\nattorneys. ``She tries to take charge in court.''\n\n     Greer is confined to a special section of the jail reserved for\nthe most troublesome inmates and has a single cell.\n\n   Linner and Greer were charged in December 1994, but she had been\nin jail since September, and he since November on unrelated\ncharges.\n\n   Greer's care alone has cost county taxpayers $66,950, based on\nthe typical $35 daily cost of keeping an inmate.\n\n   Since she has been in custody, Greer has also sent the jail into\nturmoil, filing 719 grievances in 1998 alone, including claims that\nher food is poisoned, that other inmates call her ``baby killer''\nand that slamming cell doors keep her awake at night.   \nREADY FOR TRIALS\n\n   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley does not fault judges for\nthe delays, saying they have to be sure that Greer and Linner can\nassist in their defenses. If those issues were ignored, he said,\nconvictions could be reversed on appeal.\n\n   Now, though, he says, ``We continue to argue that we are ready\nto go to trial but, ultimately, the decision is up to the court.\nThere is no way to intervene at this point.''\n\n   Greer is to be tried by Judge Bernard Dougherty; Linner by Judge\nPaul Katz.\n\n   Court rules prohibit judges from discussing active cases.\n\n   Prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for Greer. But in\nJuly, they said they would not seek Linner's execution, in part\nbecause of his mental retardation.   \nDEATH DESCRIPTIONS\n\n   In a March jailhouse interview requested by ``The Arizona\nRepublic,'' Greer blamed Linner.\n\n   ``Voices told him to kill right around the time of the murder,''\nGreer said, saying she can't recall what happened.\n\n   ``I was strayed from the here and now,'' she said. ``All I know\nis that what I was going through was very scary. Demons were trying\nto take me away.''\n\n   In interviews with police in 1994, Linner told them that Greer\nbeat the children with the tennis racket, then drowned them. Greer\nwove a different story, telling police that they died three weeks\napart. She doesn't specify dates.\n\n   Henry died first, she said, after he fell and hit his head, then\ndrowned. ``Brent said he would get rid of the body,'' she told\npolice, but didn't elaborate.\n\n   She admitted hitting Henry with a tennis racket four times the\nday he died. And she said she struck Odessa with a 16-inch-long rod\nabout two weeks before she   found her dead in a closet.\n\n   The day she died, Odessa had been left in the closet for 18\nhours, Greer told police. She said she and Linner decided to put\nthe 3-year-old in the sewer.\n\n   It is unclear when the children died. Court records say it was\nsometime between May and July 1994. Their decomposed bodies were\nfound only after Linner led police to a manhole cover near their\n36th Avenue and Osborn Road apartment on Sept. 20, 1994.\n\n   Linner took police to the bodies because he said he was angry\nwith Greer for hitting him over the head with a pot.\n\n   From jail, Greer, who has two other children in foster care,\ninsists that ``there is no mother who loves her babies more.''\n\n   ``I am not a monster like that,'' she said.   \nCarol Sowers can be reached at (602) 444-7482 or at\ncarol.sowers(at)pni.com.
