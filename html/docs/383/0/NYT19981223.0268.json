These grants will serve 330,000\nhomeless people and are the centerpiece of the Clinton\nadministration's six-year effort to combat homelessness.\n\n   Known as ``Continuum of Care'' grants, they are aimed at helping\nhomeless people find permanent shelter while attempting to\nalleviate some of the underlying causes of homelessness: A lack of\neducation and job skills, mental illness, and drug and alcohol\nabuse.\n\n   The Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded a total\nof 307 grants out of 460 applications received, HUD Secretary\nAndrew Cuomo said. HUD awards the grants on a competitive basis to\nencourage local governments and agencies to address the homeless\nproblem. The prospect of future awards is intended as an incentive\nto do a good job in serving this population.\n\n   ``It's the old carrot and stick approach,'' Cuomo said.\n\n   The remaining $150 million is for Emergency Shelter Grants that\ngive immediate food and shelter to the homeless. These grants are\nawarded through a formula that takes into account the size of a\ncity's homeless population, as well as its housing needs.\n\n   Cuomo said HUD was being extra aggressive in monitoring how\nfunds are spent to guard against waste and fraud.\n\n   Cuomo was asked whether Clinton's participation in the\nannouncement was calculated to give the appearance of normalcy at a\ntime when the president faces an impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\n   ``The government is functioning normally and this is what he\nwould do,'' Cuomo said, pointing out that Clinton has participated\nin these grant awards in previous years. ``The president is doing\nhis job, if anything with more vigor than ever before.''\n\n   Among the cities receiving awards: Albany, N.Y., $1.1 million in\nContinuum of Care grants and $159,000 for emergency shelter; San\nFrancisco, $12.9 million in Continuum of Care grants and $891,000\nfor emergency shelter; Seattle, $12.1 million in Continuum of Care\ngrants and $533,000 for emergency shelter.\n\n   In Texas, San Antonio received $713,000 for emergency shelter\nand Beaumont received $82,000.\n","Headline":"\nCLINTON ANNOUNCES FUNDING INCREASE FOR HOMELESS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Taking a break from impeachment woes, President\nClinton Wednesday unveiled $850 million in federal grants to help\nthe homeless find housing, job training, child care, and mental\nhealth and substance abuse treatment.\n","\n   Clinton also announced that his budget proposal for fiscal 2000\nwould include $1.1 billion in assistance to the homeless, a 15\npercent increase from the current funding level. ``It will be the\nlargest effort to combat homelessness in the history of America,''\nClinton said in a speech in Baltimore.\n","\n   Of the $850 million, $700 million is for 1,420 homeless projects\nin 300 communities nationwide.
