It has been almost a quarter-century since the\nDutch Parliament set Holland's drug policy on a course of its own,\none markedly different from that of the rest of Europe.\n\n   How has it affected drug use and addiction in the Netherlands?\nWhat impact has it had on Holland's next-door neighbors, France,\nBelgium, Germany and the United Kingdom? Do the results really\njustify holding the Dutch drug policy up as a model for other\nnations to follow? Or are they a warning about the risks of\nfollowing the Dutch example?\n\n   The revised Dutch drug policy was based on Parliament's 1976\nacceptance of the recommendation of a commission headed by Pieter\nA.H. Baan, a psychiatrist and expert in rehabilitating drug addicts\nwho was serving at the time in the Dutch Office of Mental Health.\n\n   The Baan Commission's report proposed distinguishing between\nso-called List One drugs _ those that present ``an unacceptable\nrisk (heroin, cocaine and LSD)'' _ and List Two drugs _ cannabis\nproducts, such as hashish and marijuana _ seen as less dangerous\nand ``softer.''\n\n   Essentially, Parliament depenalized the possession of 30 grams\nof marijuana or hashish _ enough, the legislators calculated, to\nmeet an average smoker's needs for three months. At the same time,\nthe parliamentarians vowed to continue the fight against both\ndomestic and international trafficking in the more dangerous List\nOne drugs.\n\n   Shortly after accepting the commission's primary recommendation,\nParliament went a step further by authorizing the commercialization\nof cannabis products through their open sale in a network of\nlicensed coffee shops.\n\n   Those shops were subject to a number of legal constraints. They\nwere not allowed to sell more than 30 grams to a customer. No hard\ndrugs were to be sold on their premises. And they were neither to\nadvertise, sell to minors nor operate within 500 meters of a\nschool. Out of respect for Holland's international treaty\nobligations, the import, export, production or sale of cannabis\nproducts outside the coffee shops remained illegal.\n\n   At the time the Baan Commission report was adopted, Holland had\nwhat was considered a serious heroin addiction problem, albeit one\nroughly comparable to that of its European neighbors. The nation\nwas relatively untroubled by major international drug traffickers,\nwith the exception of a number of Chinese ``triads'' (gangs) whose\ntrafficking was pretty much confined to the Dutch marketplace.\n\n   How has that situation changed today? First and most revealing,\nHolland (in the words of senior customs and police officers in the\nUnited Kingdom, France and Belgium) has become ``the drugs capital\nof Western Europe'' _ and not just of those soft drugs depenalized\nby the Dutch Parliament, but also of hard drugs such as heroin,\ncocaine and now ecstasy.\n\n   Britain's Customs and Excise Department figures that 80 percent\nof the heroin seized in the United Kingdom either passed through or\nwas temporarily warehoused in Holland. The Paris police estimate\nthat 80 percent of the heroin consumed in the French capital comes\nfrom Holland.\n\n   The forthcoming 1998 figures for France's Central Office for the\nRepression of the Illegal Traffic in Drugs will, one of the\norganization's senior officers says, show ``an explosion'' of drugs\ncoming into France from the Netherlands.\n\n   ``Holland has become the place for drug traffickers to work,''\nstates a senior officer at Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. ``It's\ncentral. You've got guys there who have access to any kind of drug\nyou want, smugglers who can deliver it for you to Liverpool or\nLondon. And it's an environment which is relatively trouble-free\nfrom a criminal's point of view. It's ideal, and it has become a\nmagnet for our criminal types.''\n\n   As a senior French narcotics officer puts it, ``Holland is\nEurope's drug supermarket. Drugs of all kinds are freely available\nthere. The price is cheap. Your chances of getting caught with them\nare minimal, and you can carry them home across our customs-free\nborders without a care.''\n\n   Worse, the greatest drug problem facing European youth today\ncomes from synthetic drugs like ecstasy and amphetamines that have\nspread across Europe like a virus since they were first introduced\nin Holland in 1987. British police estimate that a million of these\npills are swallowed every weekend in British discos and clubs.\n\n   Overwhelmingly, these synthetic drugs are coming from and being\nmade in Holland. British customs states that virtually all the\npills seized in the United Kingdom last year were manufactured in\nHolland or Belgium. Ninety-eight percent of the amphetamines seized\nin France in 1997 came from Holland, as did 73.6 percent of the\necstasy tablets.\n\n   During an official briefing last summer, a senior Dutch police\nofficer admitted to former Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the U.S.\ndrug-policy czar, that ``Holland is to synthetic drugs what\nColombia is to cocaine.''\n\n   Holland's emergence as the drug capital of Europe is not due\nsolely to the decision by the Dutch government to commercialize the\nsale of cannabis products in the nation's now-famous coffee shops.\nBut many Europeans believe it is the consequence of the tolerant\nattitude toward drugs that grew out of that policy. That attitude,\ndefined by Dutch foes of the policy as the ``coffee-shop\nmentality,'' now permeates Holland's criminal justice system.\n\n   ``If you want to do drugs, Holland is the place to do them,''\nnotes one of France's top drug police officers. ``The light\nsentences they hand out (and) the liberal attitude of their judges\nhas resulted in an explosion in the number of international\ntrafficking groups operating out of Holland.''\n\n   ``As a drug dealer,'' a senior UK customs officer observes,\n``you are less likely to come to the attention of the police in\nHolland than you are in any other country in Western Europe. For\nour Dutch counterparts to get permission to conduct a surveillance\noperation is unbelievably difficult. It is absolutely impossible to\nplace a bug in a drug dealer's home or office.\n\n   ``Get arrested with 50 kilos of heroin or cocaine in France or\nEngland, and you'll be sentenced to 20 years to life (and) serve at\nleast 17 of those years in prisons that are less than welcoming.\nGet arrested with the same amount of either drug in Holland, and\nthe most you'll get is eight years, of which you'll serve only four\nin prisons, where you'll be in your own cell, with color TV and a\nstereo, and have the right to a conjugal visit twice a month from a\nwoman who may _ or may not _ be your wife. Is it any wonder then\nthat the country has become the drug traffickers' preferred working\nplace?''\n\n   But what about the policy's consequences for the Dutch\nthemselves?\n\n   ``Our liberal drug policy has been a failure, but its advocates\nare so rooted to their convictions they can't bring themselves to\nadmit it,'' says Dr. Franz Koopman, director of De Hoop (The Hope)\ndrug rehabilitation center in Dordecht and an open opponent of the\nDutch policy.\n\n   ``First, we banalized cannabis use. We have left our kids with\nthe idea that it's perfectly all right to smoke it, and from there\nit was an easy step for them to move to the notion that it's also\nokay to use mind-altering substances like ecstasy. It is that\nmentality that is behind the explosion in the use of these\nsynthetics we've seen in the last three years, and (it) is a grave\nperil to this country just as it is to the rest of Europe.''\n\n   Even Dr. Ernest Bunning of the Ministry of Health, the central\nrepository of Holland's liberal drug philosophy, largely agrees.\n``I would not be proud if we were to be seen by our neighbors as a\nnarco-state,'' he says. ``We don't want people to come here just to\ngawk at the girls in the windows and get stoned. We have a culture\nand a history of which we are proud.''\n\n   He sighs. ``With drugs we are in the realm of theory. There is\nno simple solution to the drug problem. No one nation, not the\nU.S., not England, has the answer. But our solution in Holland is\nnot ideal either.''\n\n     (Larry Collins is the coauthor, with Dominique LaPierre, of\nnumerous books including ``Is Paris Burning?'', ``O Jerusalem!'',\nand ``Freedom at Midnight.''
