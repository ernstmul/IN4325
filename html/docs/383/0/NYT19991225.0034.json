Times News Service   \n\n   Treating mental illness is not one of society's big priorities,\nand public policy in the field often gets made in strange,\ncircuitous ways. Last June the president held the first White House\nconference on mental illness; this month, Dr. David Satcher\nreleased the first surgeon general's report on the subject.\n\n   But it is the states that are responsible for funding and\ntreatment. And in New York, which has the nation's largest mental\nhealth budget, recent policy changes come courtesy not of the\npresident or the surgeon general, but thanks to one violent\nschizophrenic man, Andrew Goldstein.\n\n   When the president and surgeon general discuss mental health\npolicy, they sound cautious. They are not looking to commit new\nfederal money to a problem that has been the states' burden for 150\nyears. The surgeon general's key conclusions _ that one in five\nAmericans suffer some mental illness and that stigma is a main\nobstacle to seeking care _ have been common knowledge for years.\n\n   But when Goldstein pushed Kendra Webdale to her death on the\nsubway tracks last Jait set loose fear and outrage among the\npublic and forced state politicians to take action.\n\n   Public policy ginned up in the heat of battle is often a mixed\nblessing. Something gets done, though it may not have anything to\ndo with the crisis at hand. In the Goldstein case, some changes _\n$215 million budgeted for more supervised housing, more case\nmanagers and more beds for long-term state hospital care _ fit the\nfacts of the case. Other changes, like the passage of tougher\nlegislation to force resistant mentally ill people to comply with\ntreatment, may or may not be a good ideas, but had little to do\nwith Goldstein.\n\n   From the early news accounts of the killing it appeared that\nGoldstein had repeatedly been offered mental health services, but\nhad refused treatment and medication. So the solution to preventing\nfuture Andrew Goldsteins seemed to be an aggressive new commitment\nlaw _ ``Kendra's Law'' _ and both the Republican governor and\nDemocratic attorney general quickly drafted legislation.\n\n   Then an article in The New York Times in May examining\nGoldstein's psychiatric record revealed a whole new set of facts.\nGoldstein had frequently and voluntarily sought long-term and\nshort-term hospitalization, as well as supervised housing programs,\nbut was repeatedly rejected because there were no vacancies in a\nsystem short of beds, programs and money.\n\n   Whether tougher commitment laws even make a difference in\ngetting dangerous people off the streets is a hard public policy\nquestion that has divided experts for years. In a mental health\nsystem with scarce resources, to make room for an Andrew Goldstein,\ndo you wind up pushing out into the street someone else who is\nequally troubled? In 1995, in an effort to assess whether New York\nneeded to change its laws, the state financed a three-year pilot\nprogram at Bellevue Hospital with tougher commitment rules aimed at\nthe resistant mentally ill.\n\n   The results of that study, completed a month before the killing\nof Ms. Webdale, were inconclusive. Recently released documents make\nit clear that the same Bellevue pilot program had two chances to\nget Goldstein off the streets but let him go. By sheer coincidence,\nhe had visited the emergency room at Bellevue twice during the\npilot program. And even though this was the period when he was\nregularly attacking strangers _ 13 in two years _ the psychiatrists\ndid not enroll him in the program. Each time, after a few days at\nBellevue, he was released to live on his own, unsupervised. A\ntougher commitment standard had made no difference for the real\nAndrew Goldstein.\n\n   In the end, the facts did not matter. Certain personal tragedies\nso unnerve the public _ the death of a Megan Kanka in New Jersey,\nthe shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado _ that it\nbecomes almost impossible for politicians not to act, and in a\nlegislative instant new laws get made to register sex offenders, to\nexpand gun control, to commit more mental patients. On Aug. 27,\nGov. George Pataki signed Kendra's Law.\n\n   That was just the beginning. By last summer the newly disclosed\nfacts of the Goldstein case justified what mental health advocates\nhad been arguing for years: a lack of state spending was crippling\nthe system. To cut costs, the state had set quotas for reducing the\npatient population at every public hospital in New York, making it\nextremely difficult to get long-term care. Goldstein was a perfect\nexample.\n\n   In 1992, after assaulting three staff members at a mental health\ncrisis program, he was hospitalized for eight months at Creedmoor\nstate hospital in Queens. But when he attacked 13 people in 1997\nand 1998, his psychiatrists could not get him into a state hospital\nfor long-term care. Instead, he was admitted to short-term\nhospitals, and usually discharged within three weeks.\n\n   The low point came in June 1998 _ six months before he killed\nMs. Webdale. Goldstein was admitted to Brookdale, a short-term\nhospital, after he struck a woman on a subway car. On his third day\nat Brookdale, he attacked four hospital workers. Two weeks later he\nstruck a nurse's assistant. The Brookdale psychiatrists applied to\nhave Goldstein transferred for long-term care at Creedmoor. But the\nhospital put him on a waiting list, a common stalling tactic used\nat the time. Within days he was back on the streets.\n\n   During the fall, Goldstein's trial kept public interest high and\nencouraged the news media to seek changes in state policy. In a\nrarity, The Times, The Daily News and The Post agreed in editorials\non the need to put a moratorium on the reduction of state hospital\nbeds, to finance more community housing programs and to support\nKendra's law. And Pataki listened.\n\n   For a while the shark attack effect prevailed: if a mentally ill\nperson committed a violent act it was perceived as part of a\npattern _ another Goldstein _ and received prime news coverage.\n\n   But there are dangers when journalists instantly try to cast\nnews events in a public policy context. Last month, for example,\nNew Yorkers were riveted by accounts of the search for a mentally\nill homeless man who attacked a woman with a brick in midtown\nManhattan. It seemed like another tragic failure of the mental\nhealth system _ another Goldstein! _ until the police arrested a\ncareer crook with a drug habit who was neither homeless nor\nmentally ill.\n","Headline":"\nWHEN MENTAL HEALTH POLICY IS SHAPED BY ONE MAN'S MIND \n","Text":["\n   Treating mental illness is not one of society's big priorities,\nand public policy in the field often gets made in strange,\ncircuitous ways.
