Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration intends to require that\nhealth insurance plans for federal employees provide comparable\ncoverage for severe mental illnesses and for physical ailments,\naccording to administration officials and Tipper Gore, who is\nheading a White House conference on mental health next month.\n\n   Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the rights of the mentally\nill, disclosed this month that she was treated for clinical\ndepression after her son was injured in an auto accident in 1989.\nShe said Monday that a goal of the White House conference was to\neliminate disparities in insurance coverage for mental and physical\nillnesses _ to ``provide parity for all,'' while eliminating the\nstigma of mental illness.\n\n   The new standards for health benefits for federal employees,\nbeing drafted by the administration, are intended as an example for\nemployers across the country, federal officials said. The\nadministration has authority to act on federal employee benefits\nunder existing law, without congressional action.\n\n   Under the new policy, health plans covering federal employees\nand their families could not set more stringent limits on the\nnumber of outpatient visits or days in the hospital for treatment\nof mental disorders than for the treatment of physical illnesses\nlike heart disease or cancer. The policy would also bar higher\ncopayments for mental health care than for the treatment of\nphysical illnesses.\n\n   Chris Jennings, who coordinates health policy at the White\nHouse, said: ``The president believes that the Federal Employees\nHealth Benefits Program should serve as a model for the rest of the\nhealth care industry. Parity for federal health plans will not only\nprovide better access to needed mental health services, but also\nillustrate that coverage of these services can be done\naffordably.''\n\n   Jennings said that details of the new policy were being worked\nout with the Office of Personnel Management, which runs the health\ninsurance program for federal employees.\n\n   Under a 1996 law, group health plans are already forbidden to\nset annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health care that are\nlower than the limits for general medical and surgical services.\nBut insurers can get around the law by setting different limits on\nthe number of covered outpatient visits or hospital days, or by\ncharging different copayments and deductibles.\n\n   Administration officials said they expected to disclose details\nof the new policy at the White House conference on mental health,\nscheduled for June 7.\n\n   The federal employees' health plan is the largest\nemployer-sponsored health insurance program in the United States.\nIt covers 9 million people through 285 private insurance plans.\n\n   The standards would not affect the health benefits provided by\nprivate employers. Similar requirements for private employers have\nbeen proposed by members of Congress from both parties, including\nSen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and Rep.\nMarge Roukema, R-N.J.\n\n   In an interview Monday, Mrs. Gore said that comparable coverage\nfor mental and physical disorders would have a very modest cost,\nand she predicted that it would not be abused by people seeking\nendless ``talk therapy.''\n\n   ``There are just too many people who saw Woody Allen movies\nyears ago,'' Mrs. Gore said. ``Lying on the couch forever and ever,\nthat's a stereotype, the Woody Allen syndrome. That's not what\nwe're talking about. It's another myth to bust. Most people with\nmental illness are not out to rip off the system.''\n\n   Moreover, Mrs. Gore said: ``A number of companies are already\nproviding parity, and it's costing about 25 cents a day, at the\nmost. That is much less than the people who have been afraid to\nprovide mental health coverage were predicting.''\n\n   Twenty-five cents a day represents an increase of $91 a year, or\n3 percent of the $3,000 spent by a typical employer on health\nbenefits for an employee.\n\n   In recent years, employers, insurers and health maintenance\norganizations have found ways to provide mental health services at\npredictable costs. In many cases, they hire specialized\nmanaged-care companies to monitor the work of psychiatrists,\npsychologists and other mental health professionals, to make sure\npatients receive appropriate and effective treatment.\n\n   Psychiatrists often resent such second-guessing. But Dr. Jerome\nVaccaro, medical director of Pacificare Behavioral Health, in Van\nNuys, Calif., said the work of these companies often led to better\noutcomes for patients.\n\n   After the 1996 law took effect, some insurance companies and\ngroup health plans simply replaced the old dollar limits on mental\nhealth care with numerical limits on outpatient visits, treatment\nsessions or days in the hospital.\n\n   ``The day and visit limits wind up being more restrictive in\nsome cases than the dollar limits for which they substituted,''\nsaid Ronald Bachman, an actuary at the accounting firm of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n   Mrs. Gore said she favored full equivalence, or parity, in\ncoverage for ``the recognized major mental health disorders.''\nThose conditions, she said, include schizophrenia, bipolar\n(manic-depressive) disorder and major or clinical depression.\n\n   The Office of Personnel Management is seriously considering a\nbroader policy that would require parity for many other mental\ndisorders as well, administration officials said.\n\n   At least 19 states, including Connecticut, have laws that\nrequire the same or similar levels of coverage for mental and\nphysical illnesses.
