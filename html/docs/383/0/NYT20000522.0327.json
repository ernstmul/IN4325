To raise\nawareness and help those in need, Rosalynn Carter has for more than\na decade hosted the annual Georgia Mental Health Forum, where 350\nconsumers and policy-makers gathered Monday at the Carter Center in\nAtlanta to hear Surgeon General David Satcher talk via\nteleconference about a historic 500-page report he released in\nDecember on mental illness, compiled from more than 3,000 studies.\nThe report found that nearly half of all mentally ill Americans do\nnot seek treatment and, in many cases, face an enduring stigma, a\nlack of services and inequity in insurance coverage. As many as\n825,000 Georgians sought mental health treatment last year.\n\n   Carter took a break from the forum to talk with Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution medical writer Diane Lore about the report's\nimpact on mental health policy and care.\n\n   Q: How would you assess the state of mental health care in this\ncountry? Are people getting the treatment they need?\n\n   A: I would say we would rank as ``poor'' ... or ``could do a lot\nbetter.'' At least half of the people who need treatment still\ndon't get it. And many of those who are critically ill are\nabsolutely not getting the care they need. We still have a cycle of\npeople getting hospitalized for a short while and then landing back\non the street. We really need a plan where they can go to a\ncommunity center where they can get the care they need.\n\n   Q: The confidentiality of mental health records has been a\nconcern for you. How is that issue developing nationwide?\n\n   A: It's still pretty dismal. With managed care, we still have so\nmany people who can access records. We still have not made any\nprogress with a bill in Congress. And it's still a very important\nissue.\n\n   Q: What changes would you like to see in mental health?\n\n   A: The main, most important thing, at the national level is to\npass laws requiring parity in insurance. I think that would do the\ngreatest good in eliminating stigma. ... (A lot of people believe\nthat) if insurance covers (a condition), then it must be all right\nto have. We've had 31 states pass parity laws, but often they are\nvery narrow in scope. Also, insurance often gets around true parity\nby imposing higher co-payments and fewer days for treatment.\n\n   Q: Are there things happening _ in Georgia or elsewhere _ that\nyou would hold up as models for diagnosis, treatment or prevention?\n\n   A: I believe Skyland Trail, a treatment facility here in\nAtlanta, is doing an excellent job, because its services are simply\nstate of the art. I also think (the companies) Community Friendship\nand Project Interconnections, which deal with the homeless mentally\nill and are located here, are taking a good approach. The National\nAlliance for the Mentally Ill is also supporting a program for the\nseriously mentally ill called Program for Assertive Community\nTreatment that is wonderful. It takes a holistic approach, which is\nreally a good way to go. Depression and anxiety screening days also\nare helpful.\n\n   Q: What are the best changes to occur in the field of mental\nhealth in the past 10 to 15 years?\n\n   A: Scientific research and the development of the consumer\nmovement. Those two things have made a total difference in what's\nhappening.\n\n   Q: And what would you change in mental health if you could?\n\n   A: I would wipe out stigma. Stigma remains our greatest\nchallenge. There seems to be a little glimmer of hope, but we still\nhave a long way to go. Part of the reason is the misconception that\nmental health is the result of a weak will or a moral defect or bad\nparenting. Too often, families still believe that if (patients)\nwanted to, they could just snap out of it. That's part of the\nreason the surgeon general's report is so important _ it gives us a\nreal chance to have science back our case.\n\n   Q: What impact do you think the surgeon general's report will\nhave?\n\n   A: The report gives us the scientific basis we need to make a\ncase to policymakers. It will help us tell the public the true\nfacts (about mental illness) instead of the myth and\nmisconceptions. It also calls attention to mental illness on a\nnational level, promoting awareness and helping people do away with\nthe stigma.\n\n   For more information:\n\n   www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/home.html\n\n   www.mhselfhelp.org\n\n   www.nimh.nih.org\n\n   www.cartercenter.org/mentalhealth.html\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   In Georgia, more than 1.6 million residents struggle with mental\nillness, and one in every eight have severe conditions.
