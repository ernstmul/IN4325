Times News Service   \n\n   The United States is suffering from a veritable epidemic of\nmental illness, according to a report last week by the surgeon\ngeneral, which asserted that ``22 percent of the population has a\ndiagnosable mental disorder.''\n\n   But how is mental illness defined? The standard reference used\nby therapists for diagnosis and for assigning insurance-payment\ncodes is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American\nPsychiatric Association.\n\n   The most recent edition, DSM-IV, which was issued in 1994, lists\nmore than 300 kinds of mental disorders _ a far cry from the 22\nillnesses identified in 1918 in the Statistical Manual for the Use\nof Institutions for the Insane, the precursor to the DSM.\n\n   Like its predecessors, DSM-IV provides standardized diagnoses\nfor debilitating mental illnesses like psychoses, major\ndepressions, anxieties, phobias and personality disorders.

For example, a good percentage of\nany prison's criminal population would seem to fit the criteria for\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (301.7):  \n\n   1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful\nbehaviors ...\n\n   2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of\naliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure.\n\n   3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.\n\n   4. Irritability and aggressiveness.\n\n   5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.\n\n   6. Consistent irresponsibility ...\n\n     On the other hand, some behavior classified as mental illness\nseems to apply to quite functional, if annoying, people. How could\nHollywood or Sunday morning television media-punditry thrive\nwithout personalities who exhibit the symptoms of Histrionic\nPersonality Disorder (301.50)?  \n\n   1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the\ncenter of attention.\n\n   2. Interaction with others is often characterized by\ninappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior.\n\n   3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.\n\n   4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to\nself.\n\n   5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and\nlacking in detail.\n\n   6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion.\n\n   7. Is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or\ncircumstances.\n\n   8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they really\nare.\n\n     Without doubt, psychiatric treatment is a life-saver for many\ndeeply troubled children. But given the manual's broad definitions,\nmany parents might question whether every adolescent is\ncertifiable, at least on occasion. Consider the criteria for\nOppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81):  \n\n   1. Often loses temper.\n\n   2. Argues with adults.\n\n   3. Actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or\nrules.\n\n   4. Deliberately annoys people.\n\n   5. Blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.\n\n   6. Is touchy or easily annoyed by others.\n\n   7. Is spiteful or vindictive.\n\n     Clinicians treating severe drug and alcohol addiction work\nwithin a wide range of diagnostic categories. The following also\nqualify as ``substance related disorders'':\n\n   Caffeine Intoxication (305.90): Recent consumption of caffeine\nin excess of 259 mg (e.g. more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee ...)\n\n   Nicotine Dependence Disorder (305.10): Tolerance to nicotine is\nmanifested by the absence of nausea, dizziness and other\ncharacteristic symptoms ....\n\n   Nicotine Withdrawal Disorder 292.0: Abrupt cessation of nicotine\nuse ((resulting in)) dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia;\nirritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty\nconcentrating; restlessness; decreased heart-rate; increased\nappetite.  \n\n   nn\n\n   Despite the comedy spin that Jack Nicholson put on it in the\nmovie ``As Good as It Gets,'' obsessive-compulsive disorder can be\ndebilitating. But the DSM's diagnostic criteria also suggest that\nthe fretful workaholic with that desktop Snoopy figurine collection\nmay require treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder\n(301.4):\n\n     1. Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization\nor schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is\nlost.\n\n   2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion ...\n\n   3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the\nexclusion of leisure activities and friendships ...\n\n   4. Is over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about\nmatters of morality, ethics or values (not accounted for by\ncultural or religious identification).\n\n   5. Is unable to discard worn out or worthless objects ...  \n\n   Many critics argue that the DSM often reflects political and\ncultural biases. For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental\nillness as recently as 1968 in DSM-II, which defined it as Sexual\nDeviation (302):\n\n     This category is for individuals whose sexual interests are\ndirected primarily towards objects other than people of the\nopposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus\n....  \n\n   The gay-rights movement ultimately pressured the American\nPsychiatric Association to eliminate homosexuality as a mental\ndisorder in subsequent editions of the DSM. Cross-dressing males,\nhowever, are still categorized as mentally ill if they exhibit the\nsigns of Transvestic Fetishism (302.3):\n\n     Over a period of at least 6 months in a heterosexual male,\nrecurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or\nbehaviors involving cross-dressing.  \n\n   The manual suggests that additional clinical research be devoted\nto treatment for those who suffer from the symptoms of Identity\nProblem (313.82):\n\n     Uncertainty about multiple issues relating to identity, such as\nlong-term goals, career choice, friendship patterns, sexual\norientation and behavior, moral values and group loyalties.  \n\n   Other diagnoses shift with the cultural climate. The latest DSM,\nfor example, eliminated one controversial diagnosis that was\npreviously applied to women suffering depression, Self-Defeating\nPersonality Disorder (301.90):\n\n     1. Chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment,\nfailure or mistreatment ...\n\n   2. Rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help\nhim or her.\n\n   3. Following positive personal events (e.g., a new achievement),\nresponds with depression ...\n\n   4. Incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then\nfeels hurt, defeated or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in\npublic ...).\n\n   5. Rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to\nacknowledge enjoying himself or herself. ...\n\n   6. Fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal\nobjectives. ...\n\n   7. Is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat\nhim or her well ...\n\n   8. Engages in excessive self-sacrifice ...  \n\n   The DSM suggests that denial can be itself be a symptom of a\ndisorder called Non-Compliance with Treatment (V15.81):\n\n     The reasons for noncompliance may include discomfort resulting\nfrom treatment (e.g., medication side-effects); expense of\ntreatment; decisions based on personal value judgments or religious\nor cultural beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of the\nproposed treatment; ((and)) maladaptive personality traits ...  \n","Headline":"\nTHE LINE BETWEEN VEXING AND CERTIFIABLE \n","Text":["\n   The United States is suffering from a veritable epidemic of\nmental illness, according to a report last week by the surgeon\ngeneral, which asserted that ``22 percent of the population has a\ndiagnosable mental disorder.''\n","\n   But how is mental illness defined?
