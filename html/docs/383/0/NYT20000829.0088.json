They come from Rikers Island, the city-run compound that\nhouses the biggest jail in the country. And they are carrying\njust-released prisoners to their first concrete slab of freedom.\n\n   Many of them have nothing more than what the guards handed them\non the way out the door _ a card worth two rides on the subway.\n\n   For some, that's enough to get where they're going. But others\nhave nowhere to go.\n\n   Many of the passengers have some form of mental illness. While\nat Rikers, they received psychiatric care and medicine. On release,\nthough, with very few exceptions, they too are given nothing but\nthe subway card: no drugs, prescriptions, or referrals.\n\n   For them, the bus stop in Queens has long been the revolving\ndoor between a turbulent life on the streets and the relative\nrespite of jail.\n\n   ``I see a lot of these guys over and over,'' the Rikers bus\ndriver said after a drop-off one recent morning.\n\n   In an era when many mental institutions have shut down, due to\nan odd combination of civil-liberties lawsuits and conservative\nbudget cuts, jails have become, as the title of a Soros Foundation\nstudy last year put it, ``Hospitals of Last Resort.''\n\n   It is a growing phenomenon in many cities, nowhere more than in\nNew York.\n\n   Thirty years ago, there were a half-million beds in mental\nhospitals nationwide, about 90,000 of them, or just under\none-fifth, in New York state.\n\n   Now, according to Heather Barr, a lawyer for the Urban Justice\nInstitute and author of the Soros study, New York state has fewer\nthan 5,000 beds.\n\n   Probably not all 90,000 of those beds needed to be filled back\nthen. And some of those who might have ended up in hospitals at an\nearlier time are finding care in outreach centers, outpatient\nwards, or other facilities.\n\n   But many of the untreated have wound up in jail, arrested for\npetty crimes, a trend that has grown since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani\ninstituted the policy of prosecuting ``quality-of-life'' crimes\nsuch as drinking or urinating in public, sleeping on the street,\nand jumping subway turnstiles.\n\n   Over the course of a year, 33,000 inmates in New York City's\njails, a quarter the total number, receive mental-health services\nwhile locked up. About half of those have serious ailments.\n\n   Of the 20,000 prisoners in Rikers Island alone, 2,500 have\nchronic mental disorders _ making the jail, as Barr said, ``de\nfacto the state's largest psychiatric facility.''\n\n   The difference is that New York state law requires psychiatric\nfacilities to provide a ``discharge plan'' to patients who are\nreleased to the outside world: a drug regimen (usually paid for by\nMedicaid) and a referral to a doctor, clinic, or shelter.\n\n   Jails have no such obligation.\n\n   The Urban Justice Institute has filed a class-action lawsuit\nrequiring the city to provide this assistance to mental patients\nreleased from jail, as well.\n\n   Last month, New York Supreme Court Judge Richard F. Braun ruled\nin the institute's favor, agreeing that the distinction between\njails and hospitals is meaningless these days. He also declared\nthat withholding assistance from released inmates causes\n``irreparable harm,'' and results in ``substance abuse, mental and\nphysical health deterioration, homelessness, indigence, crime,\nre-arrest, and re-incarceration.''\n\n   The city's lawyers have appealed the ruling.\n\n   Ethan Ward, 37, arrived at the Queens bus stop one recent day at\n5 a.m. He had served 15 days at Rikers for selling marijuana to an\nundercover policeman. Ward hears voices in his head, and suffers\nfrom severe mood swings. He was given medicine for these ailments\nwhile at Rikers; the city has a contract with St. Barnabas Hospital\nto treat mentally ill prisoners there.\n\n   But, he said, ``When they let me out, they didn't give me\nanything but the subway card.''\n\n   At least Ward had been living in a men's shelter in Washington\nHeights, where he receives medication daily. He used the subway\ncard to go back there.\n\n   Juan Serrano, 40, who was let off in Queens at 3 a.m., had no\nsuch recourse. He avoids shelters; he'd slept in one a few years\nago and nearly got killed. So he walked toward the subway station,\nunclear what to do.\n\n   ``I don't want to break the law again,'' he said. ``But if it\ngets cold, I'm going to have to find a hallway someplace to sleep\nin.''\n\n   Estimates vary widely on the number of homeless adults in this\ncity _ around 15,000 in shelters and another 5,000 to 15,000 on the\nstreets _ but most analysts figure one-third to one-half of them\nare mentally disturbed.\n\n   The issue has taken on a high profile in the past couple years,\nas a schizophrenic named Andrew Goldstein killed Kendra Webdale by\npushing her off a subway platform; a homeless man named Bently\nLouis Grant allegedly hit Tiffany Goldberg on the head with a\nbrick; and a still-unidentified man did the same to Nicole Barrett.\nAll these incidents occurred in midtown Manhattan in the middle of\nthe day.\n\n   Not so long ago, such assailants would have been in mental\ninstitutions rather than out in the public. The fact that they were\nwalking the streets is the result of a strange history.\n\n   It started as far back as the late 1940s, when books like ``The\nShame of the States'' and movies like ``The Snake Pit'' revealed\nthe gruesome conditions in many mental asylums.\n\n   Then, in the late 1950s, Thomas Szasz, a professor of\npsychiatry, wrote an influential book, arguing that mental illness\nwas a myth _ the result of psychiatric diagnoses, not real\nconditions.\n\n   Around this time, antipsychotic drugs, such as Thorzine, hit the\nmarket, suggesting that mental hospitals might not be necessary for\nmany patients.\n\n   In 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed a bill setting up\n``community mental health centers.'' All but the sickest patients\ncould be discharged from hospitals, receive treatment from these\ncenters instead, and go about living normal lives.\n\n   However, as Dr. Howard Telson, a longtime forensic psychiatrist\nat Bellevue Hospital and professor of psychiatry at New York\nUniversity, put it, ``A lot of the funding never got to the\ncommunity health centers, but patients got released from hospitals\nanyway.''\n\n   This trend was accelerated by a string of court decisions in the\n1960s and 1970s, ruling that the mentally ill could not be\ninvoluntarily committed or even forced to take their medication,\nunless they posed a danger to themselves or to others. Subsequent\nrulings made it harder and harder to prove they posed a danger.\n\n   All this was compounded by increasingly conservative\nlegislatures, which slashed mental-health budgets for both\nold-fashioned hospitals and new-style community centers.\n\n   By the 1980s, the result, Telson said, was ``a national crisis,\nmassive homelessness, and total neglect.''\n\n   Walter Dickey, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin,\nwrote an article for the Criminal Law Bulletin as early as 1980,\npredicting that many of the people let out on the streets would\ncommit petty crimes and find themselves shunted into the\ncriminal-justice system, and that _ as Barr's study confirmed 20\nyears later _ mental hospitals would be replaced by jails.\n\n   Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, filed\nmany of those lawsuits to keep mentally ill people from being\ninvoluntarily committed. Asked recently if he had second thoughts\nabout the consequences of these lawsuits, Siegel replied, ``We\nthink about it a lot.'' However, he blames the government for\n``reneging on its promise to provide mental health centers _ that's\nthe problem.''\n\n   Barr sympathizes with this view, noting civil libertarians'\n``good intentions.'' But she called it ``a great mistake'' that\nthey tore down the old system before ensuring that a new one was\nreally put in place.\n\n   In the past decade, several states, including New York, have\ndevised or expanded programs to provide community services to the\nmentally ill. As a result of the subway-shoving incident, New York\nstate, after many years of rejecting such ideas, passed ``Kendra's\nlaw,'' which allows courts to order the mentally ill to take their\nmedication.\n\n   Goldstein told police after he pushed Kendra Webdale over the\nplatform that he hadn't taken his medication, partly because nobody\nmade him take it.\n\n   However, one psychiatrist, who was on the advisory panel that\ncreated Kendra's law, wonders how effectively it can be enforced.\n``If there's a court order on a patient, somebody has a\nresponsibility to monitor him while he's out there in the city,''\nhe said. ``But we don't even have the resources to give him\nindividual care in the hospital. . . .
