Times News Service clients)  \n By RANDY CORDOVA  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   UNDATED - Rock-and-roll stardom, drug addiction, mental illness,\nviolent crime _ it was just a matter of time before someone made a\ndocumentary about Connie Francis.\n\n   Luckily, the Arts and Entertainment channel took up the task of\ntelling the singer's story, so ``Connie Francis: America's\nSweetheart ofSong'' (airing Sunday) manages to be revealing without\nbeing too sordid. Lord knows how the E! channel would have handled\nit.\n\n   Instead, the life of the biggest-selling female singer in\nhistory unravels rather politely. An unflappable Shelley Fabares\nserves as narrator, coating even the disturbing aspects of Francis'\nlife with a sensible ``niceness.''\n\n   Still, the frankness of the project is surprising, especially\nconsidering that the hourlong show was made with the assistance of\nthe 59-year-old vocalist and members of her family. If this is the\n``approved'' version, an unauthorized take could be positively\nhellish.\n\n   Francis' immigrant father is described as a controlling tyrant\nwho never wanted kids and torpedoed her romance with Bobby Darin.\nThe singer's four failed marriages are carefully documented, as is\nher longtime battle with pill addiction.\n\n   It grows even darker. The mob-related killing of her brother is\nrehashed, with home movies showing the young man relaxing in his\npool. It gives a sad face to the tragic crime.\n\n   The singer's aunt recalls Francis' headline-making 1974 rape in\nharrowing detail. When she talks about the vocalist coming home\nfrom the police station, tearfully crouching in the back seat of\nher father's car, it's almost too intimate, a secret that should\nhave stayed in the family.\n\n   With all the dark moments in Francis' life, the show winds up\ngiving short shrift to the music, the thing that made her so\nappealing in the first place. She was the dominant female singer in\nthe late '50s and early '60s, racking up 16 Top 10 hits in a\nspectacular reign.\n\n   She had a big, confident voice that could sing anything. She\ncould belt out a rock-and-roll song (``Lipstick on Your Collar'')\nor weepily handle a heartbreak ballad (``Among My Souvenirs''). She\nhad hits in 16 different languages, and her repertoire ranged from\n1920s standards (``Who's Sorry Now'') to Neil Sedaka bubblegum\n(``Stupid Cupid'').\n\n   It was both a blessing and a curse for Francis to be a superstar\nin her day. She was exactly what America needed: optimistic,\nclean-cut and personable, someone both kids and their parents could\nlike.\n\n   But she was huge during a time that most people forget when\nlooking back at pop music. She came after Elvis but before the\nBeatles, an era usually dismissed with an indifferent shrug.\n\n   At one point, a friend says that Francis became known as ``the\nwoman who was raped rather than the No. 1 female vocalist in the\nworld.'' Unfortunately, this show doesn't shift the attention back\nto where it rightly belongs. Maybe the producers needed another\nhour to do that.\n\n   Perhaps the most poignant aspect of the entire program is seeing\nhow Francis has been affected by the pitfalls in her life. Grainy\nblack-and-white footage reveals a striking woman with\ngirl-next-door good looks and a sunny, confident personality.\n\n   The mature Francis seems distant and uneasy, speaking in a\nscratchy monotone that sounds nothing like the starlet who\nfrolicked on the beach in ``Where the Boys Are.'' With her hair a\ndeep red and her appearance modified by plastic surgery, it's hard\nto connect the two images.\n\n   Even the singing voice is different. It's not only because of\nage, but due to a botched nose job that permanently marred her\nvocal range.\n\n   Still, there's a moment in ``Connie Francis: America's\nSweetheart of Song'' that shows the contemporary Francis grabbing a\nmicrophone and endearingly singing ``You Made Me Love You.'' It may\nnot be the voice we remember, but it is the voice of a survivor.   \n   \nRandy Cordova can be reached at randy.cordova(at)pni.com via\ne-mail.  \n","Headline":"\nTO KNOW SINGER CONNIE FRANCIS IS TO FEEL HER PAIN \n","Text":["\n   UNDATED - Rock-and-roll stardom, drug addiction, mental illness,\nviolent crime _ it was just a matter of time before someone made a\ndocumentary about Connie Francis.\n","\n   Luckily, the Arts and Entertainment channel took up the task of\ntelling the singer's story, so ``Connie Francis: America's\nSweetheart ofSong'' (airing Sunday) manages to be revealing without\nbeing too sordid.
