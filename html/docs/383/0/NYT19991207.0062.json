Some of them hit the rails,\nvagabonding from one place to another, seeking a job, sleeping in\nshantytowns and Hoovervilles. It was a time when the president,\nFranklin Roosevelt, saw ``one-third of a nation ill-housed,\nill-clad, ill-nourished.''\n\n   Today we're not talking about a third of our people; it is a\ntiny, but intractable, fraction.

It is our special blessing\nthat there are more jobs available today than there are people to\ndo them. Many today are both homeless and out of work because they\nsuffer from mental illness or are paralyzingly addicted to drugs or\nalcohol.\n\n   This hard-core cadre of homelessness makes the problem so\ninjurious, elusive of both quick or even long-range fixes.\n\n   Those homeless people not plagued mentally or by addiction can\nbe more easily assisted in a straightforward way. That requires a\ncommitment to spend the money to house them temporarily while they\nare guided and trained to get work, helped by the governmental\nsupport systems designed to see them through tough times. Too\noften, those people who have had the good fortune never even to\nhave come close to the affliction of homelessness are quick to\ngrumble about taxes going to support what they consider\nfree-loaders feeding on the body politic.\n\n   Even if these grumblers are so hard-hearted as not to recognize\nsociety's moral responsibility, they ought to be shrewd enough to\nrecognize their own self-interest in providing such aid.\nHomelessness undermines the stability of society, and, in time, the\ncomfortable existences of everyone else.\n\n   But that leaves unattended and unaided that major sector of\ntoday's homeless who are mentally ill. Mental institutions, which\nonce upon a time housed these people, were shuttered for several\nreasons. Many of them were bedlams, so atrocious in their treatment\nof their patients that they could not be permitted to continue to\noperate. They also were costly.\n\n   So when science discovered drugs that stabilized the mentally\nill, permitting them to function more or less successfully in the\nlarger world, there was a belief that a magic bullet cure had been\ndiscovered.\n\n   The euphoria was not long-lived. It became clear that\nunsupervised the mentally ill often elected not to take the drugs\nthey needed. And the smaller community centers that were supposed\nto replace the large institutions, in which mentally ill people\nwould receive some supervision, were not put in place. They were\nboth too costly and too inconvenient to be accepted in residential\nneighborhoods.\n\n   For that callousness we have been paying a large and disturbing\nprice. Incidents of sudden, irrational violence unleashed against\ninnocent passersby occur year after year.\n\n   We shove the homeless here and we shove them there, anywhere to\nget them out of sight. But both the stringency of the law and the\nstinginess of the public commitment have made dealing with the\nhard-core ineffective.\n\n   What clearly is required is the re-establishment of facilities\nfor the custodial care of the mentally ill as well as treatment\ncenters for drug and alcohol addicts, to which sufferers of these\nmaladies could be legally committed.\n\n   Just because earlier institutions failed in their\nresponsibilities does not mean that better ones could not be set\nup.
