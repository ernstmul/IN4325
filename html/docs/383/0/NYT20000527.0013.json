Melissa Crites makes a frantic 911 call,\ntelling the dispatcher that her 24-year-old son is suicidal.\n\n   She warns the Kansas City police that he is mentally ill, and\nhas been hospitalized eight times before for his illness. She also\nwarns police that he wants them to kill him. Police call this\n``suicide by cop.''\n\n   When police arrive in the 8400 block of Ward Parkway Plaza,\nCrites breathes easier. Until she hears three shots. Her son had\ncharged police holding a steak knife above his head. He was\ncritically wounded.\n\n   A police investigation showed that the shooting was justified,\nthat the man rushed at officers and that they had no time to do\nanything else.\n\n   But Crites complained later that she thought the police could\nhave done something else to calm him down: ``The officers did\nexactly what my son wanted them to do.''\n\n   The scenario repeats itself daily across the nation. Encounters\nbetween police and the mentally ill can end tragically. But a\nprogram out of Memphis, Tenn., that soon will begin in Kansas City\noffers hope to the mentally ill and their families, who often rely\non police for help.\n\n   The program can mean the difference between a police officer\ninflaming a difficult situation or defusing it.\n\n   Called Crisis Intervention Teams, or CIT, it is a 40-hour course\nthat teaches police how to detect signs of mental illness in a\nperson's behavior and how to calm frenzied people with words\ninstead of force.\n\n   The program was developed in Memphis a decade ago by police and\nmental health professionals. Since then, it has been credited with\nreducing violent encounters and helping more mentally ill people\nfind treatment.\n\n   Other states have noticed its success. Washington, Illinois and\nNew Mexico are among the states that have adopted the program.\n\n   The Crisis Intervention Teams program is coming to the area\nbecause of a Lee's Summit police officer, Nikk Thompson, who\nlearned of the program over the Internet after another frustrating\nencounter with a mentally ill homeless person.\n\n   ``We (the police) are the initial responders to people with\nmental illness and, frankly, I don't think we've been doing our\njobs,'' said Thompson, who once had to shoot a suicidal Vietnam\nveteran who pointed a weapon at him.\n\n   ``I've seen so many homeless guys who we'd pick up and then they\njust end up right back on the street again. Police get frustrated\nanswering these types of calls, calls that can be very dangerous.\nBut when you think about what the families of these people have to\ndeal with for a lifetime, that really humbles you....This program\nis about helping people because it's the right thing to do.''\n\n   Thompson wrote a proposal to his department's chief, Ken Conlee,\nand was soon on his way to Memphis. Now, Thompson and another\nofficer, Don Crippes, are certified and are ] working to get the\nprogram into area police academies.\n\n   Next month, two officers from Memphis will explain the program\nto area police departments. By January, there will be at least nine\nmore Crisis Intervention Teams-trained officers in the Lee's Summit\nPolice Department.\n\n   Two Kansas City officers will be trained by January, said Capt.\nJan Zimmerman, commander of the advanced training unit.\n\n   Although mental health professionals conduct seminars for police\nofficers, ``this program is truly a community policing initiative\nthat offers great benefits to everyone,'' Zimmerman said. ``Mental\nillnesses come into so many contacts with the police, from criminal\nbehavior to vagrancy. Now these officers will be trained to\nrecognize those symptoms and know which agencies are available to\nhelp them.''\n\n   Area mental health advocates are elated that the program is\nbeginning.\n\n   ``We've tried for five years to bring CIT in,'' said Guyla\nStidmon, executive director of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of\nGreater Kansas City. ``Many times the police are the persons who\nhave the first encounters because the illness has often gone\nundiagnosed. Sometimes the symptoms behind the illnesses make it\nimpossible to avoid the police.\n\n   ``When that happens, if the police are not trained properly to\nrespond to these calls, calls often from families, well, that's\nwhen tragedies occur....But CIT is just the first step to help the\nmentally ill. The creation of a mental health court is needed, too,\nto prevent gaps in service. It's not an either-or solution. We need\nthem both, and we need them quickly.''\n\n   Katheryn Shields, Jackson County executive, talked about mental\nhealth courts in her February State of the County address. Florida\nand Washington have mental health courts.\n\n   The idea is based loosely on the same concept as a drug court,\nwhere offenders are offered a choice between treatment or jail\ntime. In the mental health court, people who have committed minor\ncrimes would be steered into treatment and medication programs\ninstead of jail.\n\n   ``We're still in the early stages of organizing a task force to\nlook at how we could do this, but I hope to have it up and running\nby this time next year,'' Shields said.\n\n   She has asked Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird to be a\nco-chairman.\n\n   ``We've had such good success with drug court; I immediately\nthought this sounded like a good one, too,'' he said. ``The\ninability of the system to deal with the mentally ill has created a\ngrave problem for jails across the nation, not just here. A great\nshortcoming is that we have no system in place to help the mentally\nill. We offer no help, no treatment. It's a gigantic hole in the\nsystem.''\n","Headline":"\nPOLICE LEARN HOW TO HANDLE MENTAL PATIENTS \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY _ March 15.
