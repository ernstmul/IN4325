The first\nepisode was so violent that it scared away many viewers lured to\nthe show by good reviews.

Lurhmann, a University of California\nanthropologist, conducted 10 years of field work among\npsychiatrists in training, some of them at McLean Hospital in\nBelmont, Mass.

According to Luhrmann,\nit is managed care providers' unwillingness to pay for hospital\nevaluations of mental illness. ``The less time a patient spends in\nthe hospital,'' she writes, ``the more the doctors feel forced to\nmedicate ambiguous symptoms.'' A Harvard Medical School study to be\nreleased this week reveals that patients are three times more\nlikely to receive treatment for depression, anxiety, and panic\ndisorders from their primary care doctor than from a specialized\ntherapist. Not surprisingly, the study concluded that most of the\ntreatment was inadequate.\n\n   And if a disturbed patient needs to be hospitalized, they won't\nbe staying long.
