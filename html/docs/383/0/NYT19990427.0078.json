Junk mail, loose papers and a Bible piled on the coffee\ntable in front of him, a set of 1970 World Books on a shelf against\nthe wall behind. Short brown hair a little mussed on the right\nside. Alert eyes set deep in a pillow of a face. This man tells an\nold and familiar story in an autopilot monotone, then looks up,\nsmiles and says: ``I'm just a Pentecostal preacher who had some\nhard times.''\n\n   Yes. Exactly. A Pentecostal preacher who had some hard times,\nmakes $5.65 an hour as a courtesy clerk at the H-E-B store here and\nhas a six-year-old cat named Rosie. Rosie's litter is supposed to\nbe the odorless kind, but you can smell it.\n\n   If you were just looking at the man not smoking, you wouldn't\nknow any of that. Nor would you know that when he smokes _ always\nout on the back slab porch next to the garbage can _ he inhales\ndown to his toes.\n\n   You wouldn't know that the man has seen the apocalypse and what\ncomes after.\n\n   Nor would you know that when he takes his meds, the voices and\nvisions and delusions stop and he can get down to the business of\nmaintaining an existence within the parameters of what the world\ndefines rather narrowly as sanity. He goes to his job, checks the\noil in his car, listens to his Christian CDs, prays and struggles\nto understand why this happened to him. The man is trusting, kind,\nutterly without irony _ a discarded, forgotten part of you.\n\n   The man is named Wesley Duty _ onetime preacher, would-be family\nman, consistent hard worker. He's had schizophrenia for more than\nhalf of his 37 years. Mental health advocates estimate some 11,700\nTexans are receiving the medications, but some 34,000 _ again, an\nestimate _ are still waiting. This year, the Texas Department of\nMental Health and Mental Retardation asked the Legislature for $150\nmillion over two years to dispense the new drugs and services. (The\nfinal amount, if approved, is likely to be less)\n\n   For decades, the same anti-psychotics have been prescribed to\nschizophrenics, but the drugs produced side effects in two-thirds\nof those who took them _ facial tics, muscle spasms, tremors,\npanting and grimacing among them. This frequently led to patients\ntaking themselves off the medicines, which in turn led to another\nstay in the hospital. A new generation of ``atypical''\nanti-psychotics offers schizophrenics at least a shot at a more\nindependent life. Two of the new drugs, risperidone and olanzapine,\nreceived FDA approval in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and others\nare on the way. Side effects are generally rarer and more\nmanageable in the new generation of drugs.\n\n   But Wesley's apartment is a world away from the Capitol and the\nsuits, the powerful pharmaceutical companies and social\npolicymakers and budget appropriators. In Wesley's apartment sits a\nman who knows how far he's come and how far he has yet to go.\n\n   The little boy from Lubbock who was never quite right\n\n   A woman and her husband sit on a couch in their northeast\nAustin, Texas home, talking about schizophrenia as a family\naffliction. The woman is Anita Glass, Wesley's sister. The husband\nis Joe. They got married 20 years ago this summer, about the time\nthat Wesley started acting strangely.\n\n   Anita: ``I liked him. He was my baby brother.''\n\n   Joe: ``Always a nice man. A little hard to talk to, a little\nself-absorbed, I guess. He had an imaginary world. He had all the\naspirations and goals of an average person and he wasn't achieving\nthem. He wanted the nice girlfriend and the car and the house, but\nit was escaping him, and I don't think he understood why. I think\nhe spent a lot of time trying to figure out why everybody else was\ngetting those things and he wasn't. . . . When he's on his\nmedication, he sees the world more as it really is. And that ain't\nall that pretty. He starts to realize his life is not all that\ngreat, and he's not happy with that. So when he stops taking his\nmedication, he's happier for a while, but then he loses\nfunctionality. He's smart enough to know what's going on around\nhim.''\n\n   Schizophrenia advances with stealth and patience. But eventually\nthere's a line of demarcation, if only one that's recognized in\nhindsight, between that's-just-Wesley-being-Wesley and\nthere's-something-really-wrong-with-Wesley. He was always, shall we\nsay, eccentric, and he didn't excel in school. Still, when his\nfather got him those World Books he inhaled them, reading about\nother countries. In high school he was in French and German clubs.\n\n   ``I thought, `Wow, this world is magnificent. It's really\nstarting to show itself to me,' '' he says.\n\n   Then the tremors started. And the voices and delusions. And\nWesley's mind slammed the door shut.\n\n   So, why is it that, in the abstract, we romanticize this thing _\nmental illness, insanity, craziness, whatever we call it somehow\nseems inaccurate, hurtful or unnecessarily obfuscatory? How can we\nmake songs out of craziness? How dare we use it to describe\nill-advised choices in love (``Crazy,'' Willie Nelson) or an excuse\nto party down (``Let's Go Crazy,'' Prince) when those who have been\nthrough it and out the other side can't even put it into words?\n\n   Why is it we do that on the one hand, and then when suddenly\nmental illness becomes the elephant in our living room we pretend\nwe don't see it. Because we don't understand, don't want to think\nit might be hereditary, don't want to entertain the notion that\nmaybe it has something to do with the time when we dropped the baby\non her head. Because we can't stop thinking, Why won't he just stop\nacting like that?\n\n   Wesley's mother was dying in the hospital, and he took a little\nbreak from reality _ noncommunicative, utterly withdrawn. And,\nbecause he wouldn't be diagnosed as schizophrenic until four years\nlater, all Anita could think was what a self-obsessed jerk her\nbrother was being.\n\n   One of his mother's last requests before she died on May 6,\n1989, was that Wesley see a doctor. Wesley thought she wanted him\nto be a doctor.\n\n   Bible school, Vegas and the crack-up\n\n   What Wesley wanted to be, always, was a man of God. Clinging\nwhite-knuckled to a fierce faith made it easier to handle objects\nmoving around the room by themselves. And so Wesley went to a Bible\nschool in an obscure corner of an obscure Midwestern state. One of\nthose places where they teach you that if you hear the Devil\ntalking, you've got a real problem.\n\n   Once he tried to cook his Bible and eat it.\n\n   ``The Devil can confuse you,'' he says, before adding, ``I\nrealize schizophrenia and demon possession are two different\nthings.''\n\n   Wesley values skills such as deductive reasoning he learned at\nthe school, but they didn't teach him how to get through everyday\nlife in a cramped little Lubbock efficiency with his father, a man\nfor whom tough love was the only kind he knew or could express.\n\n   At his sister's urging, Wesley had been making efforts to get\nhelp through MHMR, but he wasn't good about keeping appointments.\n\n   And then in January of 1993, ``I cracked.''\n\n   Thus began a journey that would be called, in hindsight, his\nmajor episode. He ran to Denver. ``Well, I didn't run, I took a\nbus,'' he says. He stayed there a few days, then went to Las Vegas,\nwhere the Bad Wesley took over and partook of . . . well, you know,\nVegas. And he did a heroic job of running through money but had\nenough to get to Burbank, where he toured Universal Studios before\nflying back to Vegas, blowing the rest of his stash, staying in a\nshelter and calling his sister with the few quarters he had left in\nhis pocket. And the family fetched him home and talked with him,\nand Wesley agreed that the hospital would be an OK place to stay\nfor a while. Then he went to the state hospital in Big Spring,\nwhere he became attached, and arguably engaged, to a fellow patient\nwhom he never saw after her discharge. He traded a coat for a ring.\n\n   She went back to El Paso, I guess,'' he says. ``She was nice. We\nwent to dances together.''\n\n   A place of his own\n\n   Because schizophrenia frequently emerges in late adolescence,\nthe disease frequently derails education or careers. And those who\nsuffer from it tend to exhibit less than complete social\ndevelopment.\n\n   There are those who will take advantage. Wesley got the job at\nthe H-E-B in May of '97, but the heat and stress made him break out\nin a rash. He took a leave of absence, a breather. Then he began\nforgetting to take his medicine because people were knocking on his\ndoor, demanding money, saying they were the police.\n\n   One night he lay in bed, his back to the wall, thinking about\nhis illness. He heard a gurgling, the cacophony of demons\nchattering, dribbling out of his left ear.\n\n   The delusions are largely in the past, thanks in part to the new\nmedications and in part to Wesley's adherence to a schedule that\nprovides structure. He no longer has to call his sister and ask,\n``Did I die?''\n\n   One theory of schizophrenia is that those who suffer from it\nprocess information like wide-open open floodgates, unable to\nfilter the superfluous stuff _ ambient noise, for example. In the\ndays when Wesley was susceptible to distractions, the smallest\nthing could trigger an elaborate delusion: A number on his\napartment key suddenly led to heaven on earth; a bump on his head\nmade him believe he'd been shot in Dallas; the sound of rain became\napplause, and it was always for him; every show on TV was about\nhim.\n\n   When these things would happen, he would isolate himself and\nwait for the episodes to pass. It's been a long time since he's had\none.\n\n   His care manager and his family seem accepting of Wesley's\nprogress. He knows he's making gains and he knows he's the one who\nhas to keep doing the work, taking the medication, working at the\nH-E-B, buying his groceries and carton of Winstons on payday. He\nplays a home-grown version of the civilization-building PC game\n``Sim City'' using an old Slim-Fast can with pieces of paper in it,\nan elaborate game involving two imaginary worlds that's been going,\noff and on, since the Lubbock days. It takes a lot of time, but\nWesley has learned to be patient.\n\n   Doubly so in gaining ground with his disease. His sister and\nbrother-in-law tell him to treat it like diabetes, to never forget\nto take his medication. He wants out of the system. He wants a wife\nand kids. And he wants to be a missionary. These things may or may\nnot happen.\n\n   ``I don't know that he'll get much better,'' said Steve Lefler,\nhis care manager. ``I think he's doing as well as can be\nexpected.''\n\n   Sometimes he gets depressed. ``Sometimes I get lonely and forget\nto do things,'' he says. ``So I do retreat sometimes into my own\nworld.''\n\n   Sometimes in the winter, when it gets very cold, he smokes\ninside.\n\n   Patrick Beach writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,\nTexas.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   BASTROP, Texas _ A man sits on a couch in his duplex, not\nsmoking.
