She has a powerful voice\nin her husband's presidential campaign, but more than that, a\npersuasive way with people she hardly knows.\n\n   Just ask Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, the Rhode Island\nDemocrat who invited Mrs. Gore into his district last winter to\nspeak at a forum on mental health. Before the event in Woonsocket,\nR.I., was over, Kennedy shocked Mrs. Gore and his staff by\ndisclosing that he had suffered depression since boyhood, sees a\npsychiatrist regularly, and takes medication for his illness.\n\n   ``Another profile in courage!'' Mrs. Gore exulted,\ncongratulating Kennedy for a candor that's rare in public life.\nWhile her ``courage'' reference was clearly to the Kennedys, the\ncharacterization might just as well have applied to her.\n\n   Thursday night, when she introduces Al Gore as a faithful\nhusband, great family man, and the party's presidential nominee to\nthe Demcratic convention and a national television audience, Tipper\nGore's considerable powers of persuasion will be on display. And so\nwill a woman who has been transformed by a quiet but bold act.\n\n   A little over a year ago, as the vice president was gearing up\nfor a White House run, Mrs. Gore revealed that she had been treated\nfor depression. In 1989, the couple's son, Albert, was seriously\ninjured when a car hit him as he walked out of a Baltimore Orioles\nbaseball game. Mrs. Gore said she became ``overly stressed'' as she\nheld the family together and helped her son through his long\nrecovery.\n\n   Mrs. Gore's disclosure of depression, which was unknown to even\nher best friends, was deemed a political calculation: Tell the\nstory before a tabloid newspaper gets ahold of it and splashes\n``Tipper: `I Took Drugs''' across its cover. Mrs. Gore says as the\npresident's mental-health adviser she is committed to removing the\nstigma around mental illnesses. But no matter what the motivation,\nthe singular act has made her a heroine to many Americans who\nrelate to the problem.\n\n   At a campaign stop in Gardner, Mass., last week, the crowd\ncheered when Mrs. Gore was introduced as a champion of mental\nhealth. Afterward, seated next to Hadassah Lieberman, who grew up\nin Gardner and is married to Gore running mate Joseph Lieberman,\nMrs. Gore said the reaction used to surprise her, but it doesn't\nanymore. Every place she visits, people come up and hug her, kiss\nher, and thank her for breaking the silence on depression. Often,\nshe said, they share their own heartaches with her.\n\n   ``Talking about mental illness is a very important thing for\nanyone to do, but to have Mrs. Gore do it _ it's a real opportunity\nfor people to admire her strength and have a role model,'' said\nJudy Stoehr, who works at North Central Human Services in Gardner\nhelping people with mental illnesses find housing. Stoehr said she\ncame to the Gardner rally not to celebrate Mrs. Lieberman's\nhomecoming but to applaud what Mrs. Gore has done.\n\n   Ironically, the revelation of her vulnerability has strengthened\nMrs. Gore. She is more confident, comfortable, and sober on the\nstump than she was a year ago. Friends have seen her grow from a\nsupportive political spouse to a dogged and determined partner in\nGore's presidential race. She has always been her husband's best\nfriend; now she, her daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, and Frank\nHunger, Gore's brother-in-law, have become the most influential\nfaction within Gore's adviser-heavy campaign.\n\n   Mark Gearan, who managed the Gores in the 1992 campaign, saw\nMrs. Gore's fingerprints all over the selection of Senator\nLieberman, someone she admires as a family friend, a good father,\nand a vocal critic of Hollywood's exploitation of sex and violence.\n\n   ``I know that scene _ it was Tipper and Frank and Karenna _ and\nat the end of the day that family nucleus, that triangle,\nprevailed,'' said Gearan, a former Peace Corps director and now\npresident of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. ``Gore listens very\nintently to Tipper; she has good judgment and great radar.''\n\n   Questioned about her role in selecting Lieberman, Mrs. Gore's\nsmile disappears. ``This was Al's decision,'' she said firmly,\ngiving a scripted answer about the qualifications her husband\nrequired in a running mate. But _ turning cheery again _ Mrs. Gore\nacknowledged it was wonderful to share a campaign with people she\nadores.\n\n   ``It's so nice to have a friend along _ plain nice,'' Mrs. Gore\nsaid, casting an affectionate glance at Hadassah Lieberman. ``We're\non the same wave length. There are a lot of things we don't have to\nsay; we just look at each other and know how we feel.''\n\n   Don't be fooled, friends say, by the perky package and nickname\nthat came from a nursery rhyme. Tipper Gore, born Mary Elizabeth\nAitcheson, is very smart, savvy, and full of the emotional\nintelligence and genuine warmth that her husband is hard-pressed to\nconvey. Mental health isn't just her primary issue; it is the\nmetaphor for her presence in Gore's life and presidential campaign.\n\n   ``Tipper centers Al Gore. She gives him a dose of what he needs\nwhen he needs it,'' said Marla Romash, who worked for Gore in the\nWhite House. ``When he needs to laugh, she is the one who can make\nhim do it. When somebody needs to say, `You messed up,' she is the\none who can say it.''\n\n   Mrs. Gore, who turns 52 on Saturday, met Gore after the senior\nprom at the private St. Albans School in Washington and followed\nher Harvard-bound boyfriend to Boston. In 1970, she graduated from\nBoston University, married Gore, and moved to Tennessee. There she\ngot a master's degree in psychology, but before she could pursue a\ncareer as either a child psychologist or a professional\nphotographer (to this day, she is never without a camera), her\nhusband got elected to Congress, and the Gores, both just 28,\nheaded back to Washington.\n\n   While her husband moved up from the House to the Senate to two\nterms as vice president, Mrs. Gore's assignment was to raise the\ncouple's four children and care for two sets of aging parents. Her\ncommitment to parenting, nurturing, and maintaining some privacy\nand normalcy for herself and her children was profound. Mrs. Gore's\nparents were divorced when she was very young. She grew up a\nlonely, only child, raised in the Arlington, Va., home of her\ngrandparents because her mother was hospitalized from time to time\nwith severe depression.\n\n   No doubt her life experiences made Mrs. Gore an advocate for the\nsensitive subject of mental health. In fact, from her earliest days\nin Washington, Mrs. Gore is remembered as a high-energy activist\nwho organized congressional wives to study social issues on the\ncutting edge _ homelesness, mental health, learning disabilities,\nthe impact of technology, and most controversially, record lyrics\naimed at teenagers.\n\n   In 1984 she was a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center,\nwhich petitioned Congress and prodded the recording industry to put\nwarning labels on albums with raunchy lyrics. The mission was\nsuccessful _ the industry agreed to post parental advisories on\nrecord labels _ but Mrs. Gore backed away from the leadership after\nshe got burned as a censor, a prude, and a liability to her\nhusband's White House ambitions.\n\n   People close to her know she is none of those things. ``Anybody\nwho plays the drums as an adult woman is a person who knows how to\nhave a good time,'' says Rhoda Glickman, the wife of Agriculture\nSecretary Dan Glickman who has seen a red drum set in the hallway\nof the Gore home.\n\n   Chris Downey, Mrs. Gore's best friend, admits she provided the\ncar the day Mrs. Gore was a rascal and tricked her Secret Service\nagents into believing she was taking a short spin around the block.\nInstead, she escaped to Starbucks for a private and leisurely\nlatte.\n\n   ``She is a just a very good person with a great heart who wants\nto help,'' Downey said. ``Tipper is always trying to fix things\nthat are broken in people's communities and people's lives.''\n\n   Many of her good works go unreported, in part because Mrs. Gore\nis shy in the public eye and in part because she is too shrewd now\nto let her passions embarrass her husband. Few people know she\nentertains homeless people in the vice-presidential residence or\nthat she once escorted a woman who called herself ``Mary Tudor''\nout of Lafayette Park and to the White House gates to prove that\nPresident Clinton, whom Tudor believed was her husband, was not at\nhome. Mrs. Gore arranged temporary housing for the woman.\n\n   ``She walks the walk and talks the talk,'' said Alfonso Guida,\nexecutive director of the National Mental Health Awareness\nCampaign, a five-year, public-private partnership Mrs. Gore\nrecently set up to combat misperceptions about mental illnesses.\n\n   In his convention address Monday night, President Clinton hailed\nMrs. Gore for ``bringing the cause of mental health into the broad\nsunlight of our national life.'' Representative Kennedy is even\nmore effusive. ``She is my hero!'' Kennedy said in an interview,\nrecalling how Mrs. Gore ``warmed up the room and sent out vibes\nthat made me feel this would be the time'' to disclose his\ndepression to a roomful of seniors in Woonsocket.\n\n   Advocates are just as impressed with Mrs. Gore's commitment to\nand leadership on mental-health issues. Last year she hosted the\nfirst White House conference on mental health and got the US\nsurgeon general to issue the first national report on the subject.\nShe lobbied Congress to provide mental-health coverage in the new\nchild-health insurance law and urged the president to issue an\nexecutive order guaranteeing federal employees insurance parity for\nmental illnesses. The 1996 Mental Health Parity Act, which Mrs.\nGore championed, was one of the only elements of Hillary Rodham\nClinton's health-care overhaul to become law.\n\n   Publicly, Mrs. Gore expresses nothing but praise for the first\nlady. But she has managed to be an unusually effective ``Second\nLady of Vice,'' as she sometimes jokes about her position, and push\na controversial agenda, while posing no political threat or\nappearing to harbor personal ambition. Her record suggests that\nunlike Mrs. Clinton, she would come to the White House with a\nnuanced understanding of the power of a political spouse.\n\n   For now, Mrs. Gore says she is focused only on the fall, when\nshe expects to balance campaign appearances centered on health\nthemes with babysitting her 1-year-old grandson, Wyatt. Thursday\nnight, her job is to give Americans a glimpse of the man she knows\nbest.\n\n   ``I basically want to introduce Al in a way no one else can,''\nMrs. Gore said. ``I can really talk about him in very personal\nterms, as a man completely devoted to his family and his faith and\nhis work.\n\n   ``My role,'' she said, ``is to help as much as I can.''\n","Headline":"\nTIPPER GORE: A POTENT FORCE BEHIND THE MOM IMAGE \n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Because Tipper Gore's got a sunny smile, an\neffervescent personality, and the perfect image of the mom next\ndoor, her influence is often underrated.
