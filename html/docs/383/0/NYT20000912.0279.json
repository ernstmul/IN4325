In\nthe not too distant future, they said, doctors will be able to\nmatch individual patients to different medications, using their DNA\nas guidance, to improve the drugs' effectiveness and eliminate\nharmful side effects.\n\n   Although such tests aren't yet available, the results reported\nin the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nindicate that the concept is sound, said Dr. Stephen Liggett,\nprofessor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of\nMedicine and principal investigator of the study.\n\n   In tests on the DNA of 121 asthma patients, the researchers\nfound four different patterns of DNA in a gene that helps relax\nmuscles in a person's lungs. Albuterol, a drug that is aimed at\nspurring that gene into greater action to treat asthmatic wheezing\nworked very well in those with one pattern, not at all in those\nwith another, and moderately in the other two cases.\n\n   Based on this idea, tests for all kinds of diseases and\nmedications could vastly reduce waste of time and money spent on\ndrugs that don't help a specific patient, as well as sometimes\nproduce fatal side effects, they researchers said.\n\n   Today, ``there are no guidelines or explanation why one\nindividual with the same disease as another doesn't respond the\nsame way,'' said Liggett in a conference call news briefing.\n\n   But soon, he said, ``physicians will need to get into their\nmindset the notion that genetics will help guide treatment programs\nwhich will result in better health care.'' The new approach signals\nthe end of a ``one drug fits all'' practice, he said.\n\n   Liggett worked in collaboration with scientists from Genaissance\nPharmaceuticals Inc., in New Haven, Conn., a biotech company whose\naim is to market an array of gene tests for different diseases.\nGenaissance says it has already studies 1,500 genes, looking for\ntelltale DNA patterns that predict how drugs will affect people.\n\n   This is known as ``pharmacogenomics,'' and it's considered\nperhaps the most likely spinoff of decoding the human genome to\nhave practical application in the near term.\n\n   Kenneth Conway, president of Millennium Predictive Medicine in\nCambridge, Mass., said the report ``validates what we've been\ntalking about in the last few years'' _ that pharmacogenomics\nunderlies a new thrust in medicine.\n\n   Pharmacogenomics is made possible by the fact that one person's\ngenes differ from those of another person in about 1 of every 1,000\nletters of the genetic code that makes up our chromosomes. There\nare an estimated 2.3 billion letters of the code in our genome, or\nset of all genes.\n\n   These tiny differences in genetic code are called SNPs, for\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms. Some SNPs act like typographical\nerrors, causing abnormalities in the DNA, while others don't seem\nto matter. But there's a great rush among companies to find SNPs\nthat correspond to differences in the way people respond to drugs.\n\n   The Genaissance team had previously found that a human gene that\nthe asthma drug works on _ called the B2 adrenergic receptor _\ncontains 13 of these sites where SNPs are present in the genetic\ncode. The scientists analyzed all the possible differences people\ncould have and called each person's pattern a haplotype _ a kind of\ngenetic marker.\n\n   In comparing the DNA of the 121 patients, the scientists found\nfour common haplotypes, or markers, that predicted how people would\nrespond to the drug albuterol.\n\n   The company plans to use this information to devise a test that\ncould identify which of the four patterns, or haplotypes, an asthma\npatient carries, which would then predict whether or not it was\nworth trying albuterol. If it wasn't, the doctor could then try\nanother drug.\n\n   Genaissance plans to apply this technology to create tests for\nindividual differences that predict patients' responses to drugs\nfor heart disease, mental illness such as schizophrenia, high\ncholesterol, and others.\n\n   Ruano of Genaissance said that as these tests proliferate,\nresearchers will find diseases in which no individuals respond very\nwell to the current drugs.
