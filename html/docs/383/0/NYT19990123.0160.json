(lb) \n By ROBERT PEAR   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is proposing a major expansion of\nMedicare to cover prescription drugs, a change long sought by older\nAmericans, and a federal advisory commission may soon endorse the\nidea.\n\n   But drug companies are gearing up to fight any plan for the\ngovernment to provide prescription drugs as a basic benefit in the\ntraditional Medicare program. They fear that it would lead to\nfederal regulation of drug prices, which is anathema to the\nindustry.\n\n   Drug makers also fear that private insurers would follow the\ngovernment's example and demand discounts as deep as any made\navailable to Medicare.\n\n   Congress is thus preparing for a major debate over prescription\ndrugs. Rep. Pete Stark of California and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of\nMassachusetts, both Democrats, are drafting bills to authorize\nMedicare coverage of prescription drugs. Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine,\nhas a bill that would help Medicare beneficiaries get drugs at\nreduced prices.\n\n   Republicans agree that there is a need to help the elderly with\ndrug expenses, though they tend to favor more modest plans.\n\n   In his State of the Union message last week, Clinton said that\nhe wanted to use the federal budget surplus to shore up Social\nSecurity and Medicare and that Medicare should cover ``the greatest\ngrowing need of seniors: affordable prescription drugs.''\n\n   Clinton foresees a total of $4.4 trillion in surpluses over the\nnext 15 years, and he would use $1 of every $6 _ $650 billion to\n$700 billion _ for Medicare. The White House said on Thursday that\nClinton wanted to replenish the Medicare trust fund while also\nproviding ``a long-overdue prescription-drug benefit.''\n\n   For many elderly people, drug costs are a heavy burden. Spending\non prescription drugs has increased at a brisk pace, not so much\nbecause the prices of older drugs are rising as because people are\nusing more drugs, and some new, highly effective medications have\nhigh prices _ $10,000 a year or more. The Food and Drug\nAdministration is approving more drugs, and doctors say that many\nof the new products are clearly superior to the old ones.\n\n   Administration officials and lobbyists for the elderly said that\nprescription drugs, though often costly, were essential to any\nrespectable health insurance plan.\n\n   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the federal advisory\ncommission studying the future of Medicare, said, ``Drugs are as\nimportant today as a hospital bed was in 1965,'' when Medicare was\ncreated. Breaux said that drug benefits would simply update\nMedicare to make it comparable to the health insurance offered by\nmost private employers with more than 25 employees.\n\n   Drugs are likely to become even more important, because the\nindustry, in the words of its lobbyists, is entering a golden age\nof medical and scientific discovery.\n\n   Drug companies have developed dozens of products to treat\nafflictions of the elderly, including heart disease, stroke,\nrheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis.\nResearchers are working on drugs to treat or prevent Alzheimer's\ndisease and may soon be able to tailor drugs to genetic needs.\n\n   The cost of Medicare prescription-drug coverage would depend on\nthe generosity of the benefit and other factors, but even the\nstrongest proponents admit that it would be expensive. The Medicare\ncommission is studying several options. A relatively modest drug\nbenefit would cost the government $10 billion to $15 billion a\nyear, it said, and could add $9 or $10 to the monthly Medicare\npremium, now $45.50, which is deducted from a person's Social\nSecurity check.\n\n   Medicare generally does not pay for drugs used by patients\noutside the hospital. But Medicare officials said that 80 percent\nof beneficiaries regularly used prescription drugs, reflecting the\nhigh incidence of chronic illnesses among the elderly.\n\n   A new government study says that 65 percent of Medicare\nbeneficiaries have supplemental insurance to help pay drug costs,\nwhile 35 percent have no such coverage. Premiums for private\ninsurance covering prescription drugs are often high, and there is\nno guarantee that the people who need coverage can get it.\n\n   Another study, published this month by the Commonwealth Fund,\nsaid that 11 percent of beneficiaries spent more than $100 a month\nof their own money on prescription drugs.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American\nAssociation of Retired Persons, said: ``We have long favored the\naddition of prescription-drug coverage to Medicare. The lack of a\ndrug benefit is really dumb medicine. Drugs keep people healthier\nand out of hospitals.'' Drug therapy often reduces the need for\nhospitalization, surgery and nursing-home care, which can be much\nmore expensive, he said.\n\n   Alan Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers of America, the main trade association for drug\ncompanies, said, ``Any expansion of prescription-drug coverage for\nMedicare beneficiaries should come through the private sector and\nnot through the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.''\n\n   Moreover, he said: ``It's very important that any reform should\nbe fully financed, without resorting to government-imposed price\ncontrols. Such controls distort the marketplace, they reduce the\nincentive to innovate and our industry would vigorously oppose\nthem.''\n\n   The Medicare commission is considering a proposal under which\nthe government would offer a fixed amount of money to each\nbeneficiary to buy insurance covering a comprehensive package of\nhealth benefits, including doctors' services, hospital care and\npossibly prescription drugs. Under such a plan, drug companies say,\nMedicare patients could obtain drug coverage through competing\nprivate health plans.\n\n   Many employers provide coverage of prescription drugs for their\nretirees, and many health-maintenance organizations offer drug\ncoverage to elderly subscribers, though they are not required to do\nso.\n\n   Drug companies and members of the Medicare commission want to\nmaintain these sources of drug coverage. If Congress establishes a\ndrug benefit under Medicare, they say, it must be careful not to\ncreate an excuse for HMOs and employers to drop the drug benefits\nthey now provide.\n\n   If the government created a Medicare drug benefit, it would\nbecome acutely concerned about drug costs. Drug companies insist\nthat the government must not establish a list of approved drugs for\nMedicare beneficiaries or a uniform national price list.
