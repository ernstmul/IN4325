Times News Service    \n\n   Opening day of the New York Mets' 1997 season is still a blur to\nPete Harnisch, who started the game thinking he had a firm grip on\nboth the baseball and his life. Within weeks, he was one of the\nmost public of the estimated 19 million Americans who experienced\ndepression that year. His willingness to reveal his illness and his\nsolid comeback last season with Cincinnati have made him something\nof a mental health role model, if a slightly edgy one.\n\n   ``I'm no crusader; don't give me this bold, stepping-out\nstuff,'' Harnisch said last week. ``I just think a guy should do\nwhat's right, which is letting people know you can get through this\nthing, you can get your life and your personality back.''\n\n   Harnisch calls ``this thing,'' which cost him most of his eighth\nbig-league season, a ``depressive episode.'' He recoils at being\nconsidered a poster boy for depression. He is not comfortable with\nthe term ``mental illness.'' His own explanation is that his body\nchemistry was destabilized when he abruptly quit a 13-year chewing\ntobacco habit during spring training.\n\n   Even such a reluctant role model as Harnisch is rare and\ncourageous in sports, where the discussion of any kind of mental\nillness doesn't seem to have progressed much beyond the 1950s Jimmy\n(``Fear Strikes Out'') Piersall story.\n\n   SportsWorld alternately hides and rewards behavior that would be\nconsidered antisocial, if not downright dangerous, in most other\nindustries. It rarely pays attention to any emotional problems\nunless they interfere with performance.\n\n   Harnisch, a bluff, direct 32-year-old, crew-cut and bull-necked,\nsteered away from such abstract discussions last week during a\ntwo-hour conversation at a Freehold, N.J., diner near where he is\nliving. The interview had been promoted by a public relations firm\nrepresenting SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical company that\nmanufactures Paxil, the antidepressant Harnisch took for six\nmonths. The company pays Harnisch to make appearances and give\ninterviews.\n\n   A hard-driving, sometimes tempestuous right-hander who kicks\nwalls and water coolers when his fastball fails to pop, Harnisch\nwas neither dramatic nor particularly clinical in his descriptions\nof that lost season. He made it clear that certain details _\nincluding side effects from the drug and the effect of the illness\non his relationships _ were too personal to discuss.\n\n   Harnisch says his problems began in late March 1997, with an\nalmost casual decision on a Miami golf course to stop ``dipping,''\nat least temporarily. He could not recall, he says, any early clues\nto future depression. At the tail end of the exhibition season, a\nfew days after quitting tobacco ``cold turkey,'' he woke up\nsweating heavily, a first. He was chilled and experienced a\nmurkiness, as if he were moving through a fog. Usually one of the\nlouder and more convivial clubhouse characters, he suddenly ``felt\nlike an outsider.'' He wondered if he was coming down with a virus,\nthen if he had a brain tumor. He was unable to sleep more than an\nhour or two a night, and lost his appetite.\n\n   He confided mostly in his wife, Donna, and the Mets' trainer,\nFred Hina, who eventually gave him sleeping pills for the night\nbefore his opening-day start, in San Diego. He still didn't sleep.\n\n   Jocks plow through. Harnisch dimly remembers five good innings\nbefore the Padres hit three straight home runs. He insists the hits\nwere ``a freak'' and had nothing to do with his condition. He felt\n``cooked'' after the game, and slept well that night. He figured he\nhad come through the crisis. Then it got worse. He lost more weight\n_ eventually 35 pounds from a 6-foot, 228-pound body _ and was too\nweak to pitch.\n\n   The Mets sent him back to New York for tests. After an eventual\ndiagnosis of depression, there was talk and drug therapy. He was\nplaced on the disabled list and began a long, slow rehabilitation\nthat included a stint in the minors. It was his idea to reveal his\ncondition in a conference call with sportswriters in late April\n1997, rather than concoct a story about a physical illness. Of\ncourse, he considers it a physical illness.\n\n   ``I know me, who I am, and I never looked in the mirror and\nsaid, `You are mentally ill,''' he said. ``There was down time and\nself-doubt, but I see it mostly like a long cold, a cold in my\nbrain.''\n\n   Harnisch returned to the Mets that August. Last year, with the\nReds, he started 32 games, winning 14 and losing 7, and posted an\nearned run average of 3.14. He has been on the short list for\nvarious comeback awards.\n\n   It is hard to judge whether he is remarkably unself-aware or\ntruly successful at ``putting it all behind me.'' He says he is the\nsame as he was before, yet different.\n\n   ``I'm stronger now,'' he said. ``After Brett Butler came back\nfrom cancer, he said that what he went through put baseball in\nperspective, it was just a game, and I thought, `yeah, yeah,' but\nnow I know what he meant. You have a tendency to let the game run\nyour life, to be miserable after a bad game, a bad article.\n\n   ``That doesn't mean I'm not still competitive, I still throw\ntemper tantrums when I pitch bad, and there are things that still\nscare me.
