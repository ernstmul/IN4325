LEWIS  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Stricken with a psychiatric disorder that confined him to\nsociety's margins, Bart Gottesdiener was certain he would never\nresume his rightful place in the world, much less the workplace.\n\n   But 18 years after a bizarre compulsion caused him to drop out\nof American University Law School, Gottesdiener credits a new\ngeneration of psychotropic drugs and Boston University's Center for\nPsychiatric Rehabilitation with helping him find a job and turn his\nlife around.\n\n   ``I've proven to myself that I can work at a reasonable job,''\nsaid the 42-year-old Brookline, Mass. resident. ``I have a support\nsystem now, and a home. I've come far, and it looks like the worst\nis over.''\n\n   But for every mentally ill person who puts the past behind him,\nthousands more struggle to overcome symptoms that distort reality,\nnot to mention stereotypes that impede even the most valiant effort\nto return to work.\n\n   ``Returning to work is terrifying for people with mental\nillness,'' noted Larry Kohn, director of services at the Center for\nPsychiatric Rehabilitation. ``There is still a tremendous amount of\nstigma associated with psychiatric disabilities.''\n\n   Founded in 1979 by William Anthony, a psychiatric rehabilitation\nprofessor, the center was the first in the country to attempt to\nhelp the mentally ill reshape their lives. With the development in\n1993 of Training for the Future, a computer training program, the\ncenter expanded its offerings. But it still has the same goal: to\nassist the mentally ill in using their new skills as a stepping\nstone to the workplace.\n\n   ``People used to think bagging groceries or pumping gas would be\nless stressful for people with mental disabilities,'' said Anthony,\nthe center's director. ``That was a crazy way to look at vocational\nrehabilitation. Working in a job that was not interesting caused\npeople even more stress.''\n\n   It is no wonder that in a society where the mentally ill are\noften feared and sometimes shunned, the most difficult problem they\nface is whether to disclose their past.\n\n   Amy Considine, 26, of Holmdel, N.J., knows about such fears\nfirsthand. A vivacious woman whose rapid-fire speech and confident\nways contrast sharply with the person she used to be, Considine's\nlife was as frenzied as a roller-coaster ride eight years ago. She\nwent on binges, and then starved herself. She went without sleep,\nand then couldn't get up at all.\n\n   Then, in the spring of 1990, Considine returned home from\ncollege in even worse condition.      ``My parents thought I was on\ndrugs,'' she recalled. ``They took me to a psychiatrist and I was\ndiagnosed as having schizo affective disorder _ a mood and thought\ndisorder.''\n\n   Seven years later, Considine started hearing voices. She became\ndepressed and afraid. Voices were saying her parents hated her,\nthat she was going to die.\n\n   Several new drugs relieved Considine's depression, stabilized\nher moods, and put an end to the hallucinations, but there was a\nvoid. She wanted a job, an apartment, a new life.\n\n   Today, Considine attends computer classes at the center, where\nshe is learning Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Word, and other\ncomputer programs designed to prepare her for future employment.\nEven so, there have been moments of fear.\n\n   ``For me, the workplace is the main issue to deal with,''\nConsidine said. ``When I worked part time, people would ask why I\nwasn't working full time. When I worked at a department store, my\nhands shook because of the drug I was on. The store manager called\nme in and asked if I had epilepsy. I made up some story.''\n\n   Why not tell the truth? ``I couldn't imagine finding a\nsympathetic ear, or a reliable person to talk to,'' she said\nquietly.\n\n   Launched in 1993 after IBM donated 15 computers and technical\nassistance, Training for the Future is the brainchild of Kohn. With\nlittle more to go on but an idea, he raised $112,000 from Lotus\nDevelopment Corp., Gillette, Houghton Mifflin, Polaroid, and other\ncompanies. A $50,000 donation from Boston University provided the\nseed money for a computer laboratory.\n\n   Kohn gave each student in the first 15-member class a $6,000\nscholarship. Since then, 56 people have graduated and 75 percent\nare employed at Boston firms.\n\n   One example: Laura Davis, a 23-year-old purchasing assistant at\nthe New England Aquarium. The center's job developer, Rob Salafia,\nmet with Davis several times before she went on an interview, and\nhe placed her in internships designed to ease her into competitive\nemployment.\n\n   Using role playing, he taught Davis, who suffers from\ndepression, what to ask during an interview, how to dress, and how\nto develop good listening skills. Then he secured a job commitment\nfrom Steve Wong, purchasing agent at the aquarium.\n\n   ``Employers want to know what to expect from the new employee.\nHow does the person handle stress, and what are their functional\nlimitations?'' said Salafia. ``Graduates want help with\ntransitions. So I act as their coach and counselor. My role is to\nbuild trust on both sides.''\n\n    \n\n   (Diane E. Lewis is a Boston Globe staff member.
