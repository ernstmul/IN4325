Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Taking a bold approach to addiction, researchers at\nColumbia University are offering free heroin to addicts and paying\nthem to use it under a federally authorized program aimed at\nfinding a cure for their drug habits.\n\n   Two trials involving heroin injections are among six related\ndrug-addiction studies being conducted at Columbia's College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons, all of which focus on the role existing\nmedications can play in defeating drug addictions.\n\n   Since September, 14 addicts have received regular doses of pure\nheroin after being given naltrexone (pronounced nal-TREX-own),\nbuprenorphine (boo-pruh-NOR-fin) or methadone, which are\nmedications found to be effective in neutralizing heroin's high.\n\n   The researchers want to learn whether stronger doses of these\nmedications are needed and can be prescribed without risk,\nparticularly in light of the increasingly pure heroin being sold on\nthe streets.\n\n   ``A dose that was probably good enough 15 years ago may not be\ngood enough for heroin now,'' said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a\nprofessor of psychiatry at Columbia who directs the medical\ncollege's division on substance abuse and is medical director of\nthe National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia.\n\n   Heroin and cocaine have been tested on mice and other laboratory\nanimals. But Columbia's study is now the only one in the country\ntesting addicts with heroin, although researchers at Harvard have\ndone so and researchers at Johns Hopkins plan to.\n\n   ``If you have a promising drug in animal trials,'' Kleber said,\n``you need to do it in human trials to see if it adequately works,\nbecause we're different from animals in physiology, metabolism and\nthe ability to report on subjective effects'' of drugs like heroin.\n\n   Dr. Marian W. Fischman, a psychologist at Columbia who studies\nmedications for drug abusers, said the volunteers, who agree to\nstay in the hospital for six or seven weeks, had rejected offers to\ntreat their heroin habit. ``We would not give a drug of abuse to\nsomeone who was seeking treatment,'' she said. ``We refer anyone to\ntreatment who would even moderately consider it.''\n\n   The medications being tested affect the brain different ways.\nNaltrexone is an antagonist, meaning that it blocks the effect of\nheroin on the brain's receptors. Methadone is an agonist, which\nstifles the craving for heroin by binding to the brain receptor.\nThe third, buprenorphine, acts as an agonist at lower doses and as\nan antagonist at higher doses.\n\n   Unlike methadone, naltrexone could be available with just a\ndoctor's prescription. But because a dose lasts only a day or so\nand leaves some users feeling anxious and unhappy, many tend to\nquit. Fewer than 2,000 heroin addicts nationwide take naltrexone,\ncompared with 115,000 methadone users.\n\n   In one study, the researchers are experimenting with a\nslow-release form of naltrexone that lasts 30 days.\n\n   The second study, involving buprenorphine and methadone, gives\nparticipants who have received a dose of either drug the chance to\nperform laboratory tasks for heroin or for money. If the drug works\nproperly, the addict will logically choose the cash. But to earn a\nfull dose of heroin or $20, the participant must work hard, by\npushing a button as many as 11,500 times.\n\n   The study is taking place while buprenorphine is undergoing\napproval by the Food and Drug Administration. ``Buprenorphine may\nhave certain advantages over methadone,'' Kleber said. ``It's\nlonger acting, easier to withdraw from and has a ceiling effect''\non depressing breathing, he said, making it unlikely that a user\ncould overdose on it.\n\n   The heroin addicts are recruited for the studies through\nnewspaper advertisements as well as word of mouth. Strict standards\nfor acceptance exclude anyone who is dependent on other drugs, was\nconvicted of a violent crime, is on probation or parole or has\nmedical or psychological problems making them unsuitable\nparticipants. And because of the hospital time involved, the\naddicts would not be able to hold a job during the test.\n\n   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is financing all six\nstudies with $708,000 in grants this year, has issued the program a\ncertificate of confidentiality so that the names of participants\ncannot be subpoenaed by prosecutors or the police.\n\n   ``We have to guarantee them confidentiality,'' said Kleber, who\ndeclined to let addicts in the studies be interviewed or\nphotographed. According to the protocol summaries, up to half of\nthem are white, with the rest primarily black or Hispanic. Roughly\na third are women.\n\n   ``We do everything possible to minimize the risks in terms of\nthe selection of subjects,'' Kleber said. They must be physically\nhealthy, from 21 to 45 years old, and dependent only on heroin, not\non other drugs.\n\n   The researchers are mindful of reducing the harm that heroin\nusers cause themselves. ``They take less drugs with us than they\nwould on the street, and they're being taken better care of,'' said\nKleber, who with Dr. Marc Galanter was co-editor of ``The American\nPsychiatric Press Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment'' (1994),\nwidely used by health professionals.\n\n   First, the volunteers go through several days of detoxification,\nin which their heroin is stopped and they are put on sufficient\nbuprenorphine to suppress the pangs of withdrawal. Then they are\ngiven naloxone, a medication used by emergency room doctors to\ntreat heroin overdoses, to make them ready for naltrexone. Once\nthis is administered, they go back to heroin again to see whether\nit is neutralized by the naltrexone and for how long.\n\n   Because street heroin varies widely in purity, the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse supplies the studies with pharmaceutically\npure heroin, with the approval of the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration.\n\n   nn\n\n   ``It is given under very safe conditions,'' Kleber said. ``We\ncarefully monitor the effects of drugs on the body. And they have\nto keep responding on a computer to tell us how they feel.''\n\n   The testing takes place in a small room, where the addict is\nwired to a battery of machines measuring vital functions like heart\nrate and blood pressure.\n\n   During the individual sessions, which last about two hours, the\naddicts answer a succession of questions from the computer. Are\nthey yawning or sweating? Do they feel depressed, sedated or\nenergetic? How much would they pay for the heroin they feel, on a\nscale from nothing to $20? On the street, a bag of heroin supplying\na single high costs $10.\n\n   ``Addicts don't like to be able to take drugs in controlled\ncircumstances like this,'' Kleber said. ``It's not the way they\nprefer to take drugs. They want to use drugs when they want, as\nmuch as they want.''\n\n   The addict is also asked to perform tasks, like duplicating\npatterns on a computer screen. ``People who are intoxicated have an\nimpairment of higher functions,'' said Dr. Adam M. Bisaga, a\npsychiatrist who helps supervise the tests.\n\n   The researchers watch from behind a one-way mirror. Every 20\nminutes, a researcher steps in and takes a snapshot of a\nvolunteer's pupil to measure the heroin's effect. (Heroin\nconstricts it; cocaine dilates it.)\n\n   During their hospital stays, the addicts must attend lectures\nabout heroin's effects on their bodies and learn about ways to\nshake the habit. ``There's potential value for them at a later date\nif they decide they do want treatment,'' Kleber said. And, he\nadded, ``they're free to leave at any time.''\n\n   The addicts agree to participate in the studies for $25 a day,\nbut if they complete the study, the amount doubles to $50 a day,\nfor a maximum of about $2,700 which they must pick in weekly\nintervals of $300 at the hospital after the study is over.\n\n   When the participants pick up their checks, study workers try to\ncounsel them to seek treatment. They are also paid for several\nweeks of detoxification and preparation before the studies\nofficially begin.\n\n   ``This is for staying in the hospital for six weeks, which is\nsomething that most people don't want to do,'' Kleber said.\n``There's isolation, boredom, inactivity.''\n\n   A third study financed under the federal grant focuses on heroin\nusers who do want treatment. They are given naltrexone, but no\nheroin, as outpatients, with a spouse or friend as a monitor.\n``It's a very sophisticated approach, teaching somebody to become\npart of the therapy team,'' Fischman said.\n\n   Here, the volunteers are paid only $25 a week, plus $3 for\ntransportation, if they keep taking the naltrexone and produce\nclean urine in a drug test. The money is given in vouchers for\nfood, clothes for a job interview and what Kleber called other\n``pro-social'' needs.\n\n   About 810,000 Americans regularly use heroin, according to the\nWhite House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and 3.6\nmillion are regular cocaine users, but a proven cure for their\naddiction has yet to be found.\n\n   And even when an addict withdraws from heroin, a cocaine habit\noften remains.\n\n   Dr. Edward V. Nunes, the investigator for the cocaine studies,\nestimated that at least 25 percent of people who take methadone to\nblock their addiction to heroin continue abusing cocaine. ``Part of\nthe trouble with cocaine is convincing the patient that they need\nhelp.'' Nunes said. ``The majority of them really dance around\nit.''\n\n   To that end, the three other Columbia studies are looking at\ncocaine and how its use is affected by desipramine, an\nanti-depressant; respiridone, an anti-psychotic, and memantine, a\ndrug marketed in Europe for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. No\ncocaine is dispensed in these studies because the volunteers have\naccepted the offer for treatment.\n\n   Earlier studies have suggested that such medications may be\nuseful in blocking or diluting a cocaine high.\n\n   ``No one has been successful in developing a drug for cocaine,''\nKleber said, ``so we're looking at treatment for sub-groups'' of\naddicts whose underlying emotional and mental problems may have led\nthem to cocaine abuse.\n\n   Kleber said that finding a cure for drug addicts would have\nspillover benefits of reducing crime and cutting welfare and\nhealth-care costs.\n\n   ``The community should support treatment,'' he said, ``not only\nbecause it is good for the addict but also because it's good for\nthe rest of us.''\n","Headline":"\nIN WAR AGAINST HEROIN, SCIENTISTS ENLIST HEROIN \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Taking a bold approach to addiction, researchers at\nColumbia University are offering free heroin to addicts and paying\nthem to use it under a federally authorized program aimed at\nfinding a cure for their drug habits.\n","\n   Two trials involving heroin injections are among six related\ndrug-addiction studies being conducted at Columbia's College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons, all of which focus on the role existing\nmedications can play in defeating drug addictions.\n","\n   Since September, 14 addicts have received regular doses of pure\nheroin after being given naltrexone (pronounced nal-TREX-own),\nbuprenorphine (boo-pruh-NOR-fin) or methadone, which are\nmedications found to be effective in neutralizing heroin's high.\n","\n   The researchers want to learn whether stronger doses of these\nmedications are needed and can be prescribed without risk,\nparticularly in light of the increasingly pure heroin being sold on\nthe streets.\n","\n   ``A dose that was probably good enough 15 years ago may not be\ngood enough for heroin now,'' said Dr. Herbert D.
