(nk) \n By FOX BUTTERFIELD   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The first comprehensive study of the rapidly growing number of\nemotionally disturbed people in the nation's jails and prisons has\nfound that there are 283,800 inmates with severe mental illness,\nabout 16 percent of the total jail population. The report confirms\nthe belief of many state, local and federal experts that jails and\nprisons have become the nation's new mental hospitals.\n\n   The study, released by the Justice Department on Sunday, paints\na grim statistical portrait, detailing how emotionally disturbed\ninmates tend to follow a revolving door from homelessness to\nincarceration and then back to the streets with little treatment,\nmany of them arrested for crimes that grow out of their illnesses.\n\n   According to the report, mentally ill inmates in state prisons\nwere more than twice as likely to have been homeless before their\narrest than other inmates, twice as likely to have been physically\nand sexually abused in childhood and far more likely to have been\non drugs or alcohol.\n\n   In another reflection of their chaotic lives, the study found\nthat emotionally disturbed inmates had many more previous\nincarcerations than other prisoners. More than three quarters of\nthem had been sentenced to jail or prison before, and half had\nserved three or more prior sentences.\n\n   Many of them were arrested for bizarre public behavior or petty\ncrimes like loitering or public intoxication. But the report, by\nthe Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, also found\nthat mentally ill inmates in state prisons were more likely than\nother prisoners to have been convicted of a violent crime.\n\n   Moreover, once incarcerated, emotionally disturbed inmates in\nstate prisons spend an average of 15 months longer behind bars than\nother prisoners, often because their delusions, hallucinations or\nparanoia make them more likely to get in fights or receive\ndisciplinary reports.\n\n   ``This study provides data to show that the incarceration of the\nmentally ill is a disastrous, horrible social issue,'' said Kay\nRedfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Medicine. ``There is something fundamentally broken in\nthe system that covers both hospitals and jails,'' said Jamison,\nthe author of ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,'' to be\npublished later this year by Knopf.\n\n   With the wholesale closings of public mental hospitals in the\n1960s, and the prison boom of the past two decades, jails and\nprisons are often the only institutions open 24 hours a day and\nrequired to take the emotionally disturbed.\n\n   The hospitals were closed at a time when new antipsychotic drugs\nmade medicating patients in the community seem a humane alternative\nto long-term hospitalization. From a high of 559,000 in 1955, the\nnumber of patients in state hospitals dropped to 69,000 in 1995.\n\n   But drugs work only when taken, and many states failed to build\na promised network of clinics to monitor patients. To compound the\nproblem, for-profit hospitals began turning away the psychotic.\n\n   At the same time, the number of jail and prison beds has\nquadrupled in the last 25 years, with 1.8 million Americans now\nbehind bars.\n\n   ``Jails have become the poor person's mental hospitals,'' said\nLinda A. Teplin, a professor of psychiatry and director of the\npsycho-legal studies program at Northwestern University.\n\n   All previous estimates of the number of emotionally disturbed\ninmates have been based on research by Teplin in the Cook County\nJail in Chicago. She found that 9.5 percent of male inmates there\nhad experienced a severe mental disorder like schizophrenia, manic\ndepression or major depression, four times the rate in the general\npopulation.\n\n   Teplin said that while she welcomed the Justice Department\ncount, it was open to question because the study relied on reports\nby the inmates themselves, who were asked whether they had a mental\ncondition or had ever received treatment for a mental problem.\nPeople with emotional disorders often are not aware of them, or do\nnot want to report them, she said, so the Justice Department\nestimate of more than a quarter million inmates with mental illness\nmay actually be too low, Teplin said.\n\n   In addition, Teplin said, the study was not conducted by mental\nhealth professionals using diagnostic tests, so it was impossible\nto tell what mental disorders the inmates suffered from, and\nwhether they were severe illnesses, like schizophrenia, or\ngenerally less severe problems, like anxiety disorders.\n\n   One of the most striking findings in the study, and the one most\nlikely to be disputed, is that mentally ill inmates were more\nlikely to have been incarcerated for a violent offense than other\nprisoners, with 53 percent of emotionally disturbed inmates in\nstate prisons sentenced for a violent crime, compared with 46\npercent of other prisoners.\n\n   Specifically, the report found that 13.2 percent of mentally ill\ninmates in prisons had been convicted of murder, compared with 11.4\npercent of other prisoners, and 12.4 percent of mentally ill\ninmates had been convicted of sexual assault, compared with 7.9\npercent of other prisoners. Emotionally disturbed inmates in state\nprisons had also been convicted of more property crimes, but were\nonly half as likely to have been sentenced for drug crimes.\n\n   Advocates for the mentally ill have worked hard to show that\nemotionally disturbed people are no more violent than others, to\ntry to lessen the stigma surrounding mental illness. But recent\nresearch, while confirming that mentally ill people may not be more\nviolent than others, suggests that they can become violent in a\nnumber of conditions, including when they are off their\nmedications, are actively psychotic or are taking drugs or alcohol.\n\n   In another important finding, also subject to differing\ninterpretations, the study found that reported rates of mental\nillness varied by race and gender, with white and female inmates\nreporting higher rates than black and male inmates. The highest\nrates of mental illness were among white female state prisoners,\nwith an estimated 29 percent of them reporting emotional disorders,\ncompared with 20 percent of black female prisoners. Overall, 22.6\npercent of white state prisoners were identified as mentally ill,\ncompared with 13.5 percent of black prisoners.\n\n   Dr. Dorothy Otnow-Lewis, a psychiatrist, said the differences\nwere a result of white psychiatrists ``being very bad at\nrecognizing mental illness in minority individuals.'' Psychiatrists\nare more likely to dismiss aggressive behavior in men, particularly\nblack men, as a result of their being bad, rather than being mad,\nsaid Otnow-Lewis, who is a senior criminal justice fellow at the\nCenter on Crime, Communities and Culture of the Soros Foundation.\n\n   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health\nAssociation, said the finding that mentally ill inmates tend to\nhave more previous incarcerations than other prisoners ``shows that\nthe criminal justice system is just a revolving door for a person\nwith mental illness, from the street to jail and back without\ntreatment.''\n\n   Jamison noted that jails and prisons are not conducive to\ntreatment, even when it is available. ``Inmates get deprived of\nsleep,'' she said, ``and isolation can exacerbate their\nhallucinations or delusions.''\n","Headline":"\nEXPERTS SAY STUDY CONFIRMS PRISON'S NEW ROLE AS MENTAL HOSPITAL \n","Text":["\n   The first comprehensive study of the rapidly growing number of\nemotionally disturbed people in the nation's jails and prisons has\nfound that there are 283,800 inmates with severe mental illness,\nabout 16 percent of the total jail population.
