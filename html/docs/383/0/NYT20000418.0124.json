The pharmacist has asked that benign little\nquestion and you don't know what to say. Last week, you were buying\na prescription drug for your baby. Then, the answer rolled easily\noff your tongue: No. Now, though, you're getting a prescription\nfilled from your dermatologist and the matter seems somewhat less\nserious. Yes, you'll take the generic, you say, knowing that the\nmedicine will cost you less.\n\n   And so you make a decision _ choose the generic or the brand\nname _ almost every time you visit the prescription counter at your\npharmacy. Generic substitutes are available for about half the\ndrugs in wide use.\n\n   Generic versions of brand-name drugs have been available to\nconsumers in Texas for almost 20 years. Generic drug use in Texas\nhas skyrocketed from about 18.6 percent of the prescription market\nin 1994 to almost half of all drug sales today, according to one\nestimate. Nationally, generics captured about 46 percent of the\n$121 billion prescription drug market last year.\n\n   Generic drugs save consumers an estimated $8 to $10 billion a\nyear at retail pharmacies, the Congressional Budget Office\nestimates. Even more billions are saved when hospitals use\ngenerics.\n\n   Most of the time, consumers know that the generic is cheaper,\nproviding savings for both them and their health-care providers.\nBut often, that's the only information a buyer has, leaving him or\nher to make an important decision without much guidance.\n\n   Are generic drugs exactly the same as the brand-name drugs? Are\nthey as strong as the brand-name equivalent and do they act as\nquickly? Do they have different side effects? In what ways can they\ndiffer from brand-name drugs? What standards do generic drugs have\nto meet to gain FDA approval?\n\n   The answers to these questions are complex, but they also seem\nto be clear. Here, 10 things every consumer should know about\ngenerics to answer your pharmacist's question with confidence.\n\n   _\n\n   1. Generics are chemical clones.\n\n   A generic drug is a chemical clone of a drug sold under a brand\nname.\n\n   Pharmaceutical companies get a 17-year patent on any new brand\ndrug they develop through their own research. These patents usually\nhave only a seven-to-eight-year market value since it takes\neight-to-10 years to bring a new drug to the market. When a patent\nexpires, other companies are free to market the generic versions.\n\n   There are generic versions of both prescription and\nover-the-counter medicines and often several brand names for the\nsame drug. For example, ibuprofen is the generic name of the\nanti-inflammatory drug sold under the brand names Motrin and Advil.\n\n   _\n\n   2. To be approved by the FDA, generic drugs must be\nbioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name\ncounterparts.\n\n   Under provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA is\nrequired to publish a detailed list of approved generic drugs each\nyear with monthly updates. ``Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,'' also known as ``The Orange\nBook'' is used by doctors and pharmacists in making generic\nsubstitutions.\n\n   These products are considered pharmaceutical equivalents if they\ncontain the same active ingredient or ingredients, are of the same\ndosage form and route of administration, and are identical in\nstrength or concentration to the name-brand. Since generics use the\nsame active ingredients and are shown to work the same way in the\nbody, they have the same risk-benefit profile as their brand-name\ncounterparts.\n\n   The FDA requires generics to have the same quality, strength,\npurity and stability as brand-name drugs. The firm seeking to sell\na generic drug also must show that its drug delivers the same\namount of active ingredient in the same time frame as the original\nproduct.\n\n   One way scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the\ntime it takes the generic drug to reach the blood stream in 24 to\n36 healthy, normal volunteers. This gives them the rate of\nabsorption _ called bioavailability _ of the generic drug, which\nthey then compare to that of the pioneer drug. The generic version\nmust deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's\nbloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.\n\n   Using bioequivalence as the basis for approving generic copies\nof drug products was established by the Drug Price Competition and\nPatent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the\n``Waxman-Hatch Act.''\n\n   ``FDA-approved generic drugs are bioequivalent and\ntherapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts,'' says\nDoug Sporn, former director of the Food and Drug Administration's\nOffice of Generic Drugs.\n\n   ``We have no interest in approving generic drugs that are not\ntherapeutically equivalent,'' says Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of\nthe FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\n   ``To date, there are no documented examples of a generic product\nmanufactured to meet its approved specifications that could not be\nused interchangeably with the corresponding brand-name drug,'' says\nDr. Stuart Nightingale, associate commissioner for health affairs\nfor the FDA.\n\n   _\n\n   3. A generic may, however, differ from a brand-name drug in\nseveral ways, and one company's generic version of a drug might be\nslightly different from another's.\n\n   Pharmaceutically equivalent drug products may differ in\ncharacteristics such as shape, scoring (grooves on the surface of\nsome tablets), packaging, colors, flavors and preservatives,\nexpiration date, and within certain limits, labeling.\n\n   In addition, though generic drugs are required to contain the\nsame active ingredients in the same amounts as their brand-name\nequivalents, the original and copycats may contain different\npreservatives and dyes that can cause problems for some people.\n\n   MORE\nnn\n\n   In a few cases, a patient may actually do better with a generic\nthat contains a different preservative from the original, or he may\nnot be able to use the generic at all because the preservative\ncauses an allergic reaction or irritation.\n\n   The FDA monitors reports of adverse drug reactions and has found\nno difference in the rates between generic and brand-name drugs. In\nother words, there is no evidence to show that, in general, generic\ndrugs are more likely to cause more side effects.\n\n   Because there may be more than one company producing a generic\nfor a brand-name drug, if you find one that works for you without\ncausing side effects, you may want to request that same company's\ngeneric when getting a refill or new prescription. Do not assume\nyou will get the exact same drug.\n\n   _\n\n   4. Generics are not subject to the same extensive clinical\ntrials as the brand-name drugs in seeking FDA approval.\n\n   Generics are not required to replicate the extensive clinical\ntrials that have already been used in the development of the\noriginal, brand-name drug, according to the FDA.\n\n   Brand-name tests usually involve a few hundred to a few thousand\npatients. Since the safety and efficacy of the brand-name product\nhas already been well established in clinical testing _ and\nfrequently in many years of patient use _ it is scientifically\nunnecessary and would be unethical to require that such extensive\ntesting be repeated on human subjects for each generic drug.\n\n   _\n\n   5. They're made by pharmaceutical companies that must meet FDA\nstandards.\n\n   Generic firms have facilities comparable to brand-name firms.\nThe FDA conducts approximately 3,500 inspections a year to ensure\nstandards are met.\n\n   Often several pharmaceutical companies make their own generic\nversions of a drugs.\n\n   In some cases (but not often because it doesn't make financial\nsense) when its patent expires, the company making the brand-name\ndrug begins making its own generic version.\n\n   You can always check with the pharmacist to find out who makes a\nparticular generic or, if you like the generic you are taking, to\nmake certain your prescription is refilled with the same\nsubstitute.\n\n   _\n\n   7. When generic drugs were introduced in the 1970s, Texas\ndoctors seemed reluctant to use them.\n\n   ``Texas was the second from the last state in the nation to pass\nlegislation allowing generic drug substitution \\Rin 1981\\S,'' Dr.\nMarvin Shepherd, professor and director of pharmacy practice and\nadministration at the University of Texas College of Pharmacy in\nAustin. ``We were 10 years behind other states. Doctors wanted to\nknow specifically what their patients were taking. They wanted\ncontrol, and they didn't have a lot of faith in the generic drug\nindustry.''\n\n   _\n\n   8. Generic use declined after a 1989 scandal, but the FDA has\nsince taken strong steps to monitor the generic drug industry.\n\n   The generic drug scandal of 1989 shook public confidence in the\nFDA.\n\n   Some generic drug companies gave the FDA false data to win\napproval for their products and offered illegal gratuities to FDA\nemployees. As a result, more than 200 products were removed from\nthe market, 36 generic drug makers were investigated, nine were\nreferred to federal grand juries, and five high-ranking FDA\nemployees, including Marvin Seife, once director of the agency's\ngeneric drug division, lost their jobs.\n\n   No actual health threats were found, but officials involved were\nreferred to the Justice Department and charged with fraud and\nreckless disregard for the health of consumers.\n\n   Then-commissioner Dr. Frank E. Young pledged to strengthen the\ndrug review system with a ``trust-but-verify approach.''\n\n   More recently, in a letter to health care practitioners\nnationwide, Nightingale assured that any FDA-approved brand-name\ndrug can be interchanged with any FDA-approved therapeutically\nequivalent generic product.\n\n   _\n\n   9. One factor influencing Texas doctors to accept generics is a\nmanaged care system that emphasizes cutting costs.\n\n   ``Managed care has forced them (doctors) to change,'' Shepherd\nsays.\n\n   Nationwide, 71 percent of HMOs now require generic substitution\nwhenever possible, he says. When insurance companies will cover the\nbrand names, the patient's co-pay is higher _ often two or three\ntimes higher.\n\n   _\n\n   10. There are certain classes of drugs that many physicians and\npharmacists believe should not be substituted, even when a generic\nis available. A Fort Worth allergist and member of the American\nMedical Association's House of Delegates, points to theophyline, as\nan example.\n\n   The widely used oral asthma medication is manufactured under\nmany brand names as well as generic, but, someone doing well under\none brand should not be switched, Wynn says.\n\n   ``Theophyline has been around for decades, and molecule by\nmolecule, there shouldn't be any differences,'' she acknowledges.\n``But, it is chemically related to caffeine and can have the same\nside effects _ stomach aches, central nervous system disorders,\neven seizures and comas. The generic theophylines are not as free\nof side effects or as predictable. Absorption and blood-serum\nlevels may be eratic even though it's the exact same medication in\nthe exact same dose. I was taught in training never to substitute\ntheophyline. Most allergists will not allow generic substitution\nfor that drug,'' she says.\n\n   (Carolyn Poirot writes on health issues for the Fort Worth\nStar-Telegram.
