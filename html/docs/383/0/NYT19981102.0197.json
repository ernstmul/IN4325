Times News Service    \n\n   Depression among older people is an often unrecognized and\nuntreated problem that can tarnish the golden years for millions of\npeople who might otherwise find joy, not anguish, in their old age.\n\n   That includes older people in nursing homes as well as those\nliving independently. Experts estimate that as many as 90 percent\nof depressed elderly Americans are not being treated.\n\n   More than five million Americans age 65 and older _ nearly one\nin six _ suffer from serious, persistent symptoms of depression,\nand another one million have major clinical depression, an\nimmobilizing disorder that can lead to suicide.\n\n   From 1980 to 1992, suicide rates rose by 9 percent among all\nAmericans 65 and older and by 35 percent among those aged 80 to 84.\nOnly a small percentage of those deaths are believed to represent a\ncalculated escape from an incurable, incapacitating illness.\n\n   Most older people contemplating suicide see their primary care\ndoctor within the month before killing themselves, and 40 percent\nmake that visit in the week before committing suicide. Rarely do\nthese doctors detect suicidal potential in older people before it\nis too late.\n\n   The failure to treat depression in the elderly, as in younger\npeople, is a costly mistake. It can lead to a loss of self-reliance\nand the ability to live independently, which in turn increases the\nburden on other family members and the cost of daily care and\nmedical care.\n\n   Depression increases the likelihood that a serious physical\nillness will develop or get worse. Depressed older people make more\nmedical visits, require more tests and stay longer in hospitals.\n\n   Also lost is the contribution they can make to their families\nand society, including caring for children and elderly friends,\nmeal preparation, tutoring and volunteer work for myriad social and\ncultural organizations.\n\n   Many mistaken beliefs and expectations about depression and\naging impede effective treatment that would brighten the days of\nolder people, improve their physical health and enhance their\nrelationships with family members and friends.\n\n   MYTH It is natural to become increasingly depressed with age.\n\n   FACT Dr. Barry Liebowitz, an expert on the emotional disorders\nof aging at the National Institute of Mental Health, said,\n``Depression is not the outcome of natural processes of aging and\nshould not be considered normal.'' Advancing age per se does not\ncause depression.\n\n   MYTH Of course older people are depressed; their spouses and\nfriends are dying all around them.\n\n   FACT The death of spouses, companions and friends can cause\nprofound sadness and sometimes even major depression, but at any\nage mentally healthy people bounce back from such losses and,\nwithin a year or so, find new sources of support and pleasure.\nUntreated depression, on the other hand, often results in social\nisolation, which only exacerbates the depression.\n\n   MYTH So many older people have serious health problems, why\nwouldn't they be depressed.\n\n   FACT Mentally healthy people of any age who have chronic\nphysical disabilities or diseases soon learn to adapt to their\nlimitations and get the most out of life that they can. It is not\nso much that illness causes depression as that depression increases\nthe risk of illness, functional decline and even symptoms of\ndementia.\n\n   Sometimes, however, the biological consequences of a health\nproblem _ not the person's reaction to it _ or the medications used\nto treat another illness can cause depression.\n\n   For example, as many as 40 percent of stroke victims experience\nchanges in brain chemicals, and those changes result in chronic\ndepression. Experts also suspect that there are many other older\npeople who become depressed following hidden strokes, including\ntransient ischemic attacks.\n\n   MYTH Older people who are healthy and financially secure have no\nreason to be depressed; they should be happy about their good\nfortune.\n\n   FACT With rare exception, depression is a medical illness.\nPeople who are ill with diabetes or arthritis, say, are not\nexpected to cure themselves by changing their mental outlook. If\npeople who are depressed could ``look on the bright side,'' ``pull\nthemselves together '' or ``be grateful for all the good things'' _\nas they are often told to do _ they would. What they need is\nconcern, compassion and effective treatment.\n\n   nn\n\n   At any age, depression can be difficult to diagnose because it\nhas many different causes and symptoms. In older people, the\npicture is often complicated by the coexistence of other serious\nphysical problems that overshadow the depression.\n\n   Too often, depression is overlooked because it is seen as\n``understandable'' in light of the person's other problems. But\nwhether depression is precipitated by death of a spouse or a heart\nattack or it seems to strike out of the blue, it warrants\nprofessional attention. In every case, relief of the depression can\nfacilitate a person's return to normal functioning.\n\n   Among the elderly, the classic symptoms of depression _ deep\nsadness and lack of pleasure in people and activities they once\nenjoyed _ are often replaced by irritability and apathy, a\npervasive disinterest in life and what it may have to offer.\n\n   Other common hallmarks of depression in the elderly include\ndifficulty concentrating, memory lapses, loss of appetite,\ndiminished energy and a physical slowing down. These symptoms are\neasily mistaken for signs of age _ and disregarded.\n\n   Liebowitz, writing in The Decade of the Brain, a publication of\nthe National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, pointed out that\n``depression is chronic and recurring and requires long-term\ntreatment accompanied by lifestyle changes and, commonly,\nenvironmental manipulations. Social support _ particularly from\nfamily members _ is critical.''\n\n   In other words, treating depression in the elderly is similar to\ntreating it in younger people.\n\n   But there are some important differences. Dr. Herbert Harris,\nalso of the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that adverse\nreactions to antidepressant drugs are more common in older people,\nwho tend to develop unwanted side effects even at relatively low\ndoses.\n\n   Doctors must also look out for adverse interactions with other\nmedicines the patients take. Sometimes the patient must try several\ndifferent treatments in succession before the one with the most\nbenefit and fewest side effects is found.\n\n   Older people who are depressed can also be their worst enemies.\nCompliance with treatment tends to be poor and short-lived,\nparticularly in light of drug side effects, the number of drugs\nmany of them have to take for other conditions and the lack of\nfollow-up by the prescribing physician.\n\n   Another inhibiting factor in effective treatment is the belief\nof doctors and family members that depression is the least of an\nolder person's problems and not worth treating. Yet, Dr. George\nAlexopoulos, a psychiatrist at Cornell University Medical College,\nreports that treating depression in a patient with Alzheimer's\ndisease, for example, improves both the depression and the symptoms\nof dementia.\n\n   And among patients with heart disease and those living in\nnursing homes, treating depression improves physical functioning,\ndecreases pain, improves the person's outlook and prolongs life.
