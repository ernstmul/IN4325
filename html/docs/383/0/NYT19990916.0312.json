In hindsight,\nit probably wouldn't have been unreasonable to think someone should\nhave helped him find a psychiatric evaluation.''\n\n   But how?\n\n   Lauralee Harris, executive director of the Mental Health\nAssociation of Tarrant County, which serves Fort Worth, said it is\noften hard to tell when people need help.\n\n   ``Most mentally ill people are not problematic,'' said Harris.\n``They say things that don't make a great deal of sense or do\nthings we wouldn't do. However, sometimes people are so obviously\nover that line that they clearly need help from neighbors and\nfriends and family.''\n\n   Harris said that, if someone is extremely depressed, talking\nabout suicide or hurting others, police should be called and the\nperson's statements should not be challenged.\n\n   ``If you believe a person is suicidal or dangerous, absolutely\ncall the police,'' Harris said. ``A 911 call is very appropriate.\nWe suggest if it's someone you don't know well, don't try to\nchallenge their beliefs.\n\n   ``In Tarrant County, Mental Health-Mental Retardation can do a\ncrisis response, but a person's got to be very, very ill,'' she\nsaid. ``From what I'm hearing, I don't know if a crisis team would\nhave responded (to Ashbrook's behavior.) It seemed like he was\nfunctioning and getting out.''\n\n   Churches sometimes attract those with mental illness, who may be\nreaching out for help, the professionals said. Ministers said that\nis a concern for churches.\n\n   ``We greet everyone who comes to our church with a warm\nwelcome,'' First Baptist Church pastor Charles Wade said. ``If our\nushers and greeters detect some anxiety or frustration on the part\nof the visitor who comes, we seek to minister to them gently and\nfirmly as needed.\n\n   ``A church cannot allow itself to take on a siege mentality,''\nhe said. ``We will not fence people out and thereby fence ourselves\nin. God's people must always be vulnerable, but they must also be\ncareful. We try to do both.''\n\n   Mary Hearon, associate director of programs of the Mental Health\nAssociation of Greater Dallas, said that as a licensed professional\ntherapist she is required to call police if she believes someone is\nsuicidal or homicidal.\n\n   ``But for John Q. Public, that's a hard call in today's world,''\nshe said. ``We can't predict behavior, especially if mental illness\nis involved.''\n\n   .MDNM/ As development director of Mental Health Association of\nColorado, Michelle Hoffer dealt with the aftermath of the shootings\nat Columbine High School. She said that her agency has tried to\nfocus on prevention and intervention for those with mental illness\nand at risk of suicide.\n\n   ``It was hard to do because there was so much emotion,'' Hoffer\nsaid.\n\n   Several education programs were developed, many geared towards\nsuicide and depression, including a speakers bureau and brown-bag\ntalks for corporations on conflict management, suicide and grief.
