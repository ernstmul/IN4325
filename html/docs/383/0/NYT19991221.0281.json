HERSZENHORN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban\ndevelopment, said on Tuesday that HUD would take direct control of\na program that provides $60 million in federal money for services\nfor the homeless in New York City, because, he said, the\nadministration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could not be trusted to\ndistribute the money fairly.\n\n   Cuomo, a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York\nSenate race, said his decision was in response to a recent federal\ncourt decision that found that the Giuliani administration had\nimproperly blocked an AIDS service organization from receiving\nfederal money, in retaliation for the organization's frequent\ncriticism of the mayor.\n\n   ``We cannot allow federal funds to be politicized,'' Cuomo said,\nin announcing at a State Assembly hearing in Manhattan that city\nofficials would no longer be responsible for awarding grants under\nHUD's Homeless Continuum of Care program. ``We're going to remove\nthe city of New York from a position of control of those federal\nfunds.''\n\n   Giuliani swiftly retaliated, accusing Cuomo of playing politics\nwith the nation's programs for the homeless. Giuliani is Mrs.\nClinton's likely Republican opponent in the Senate race, and her\ncampaign manager is Bill De Blasio, who until recently was theregional HUD director in New York.\n\n   ``There is no question that Andrew Cuomo runs a major league\npolitical operation,'' the mayor said at his daily news conference.\n``He wants to take over the handing out of money directly, which is\notherwise described as political patronage.''\n\n   Cuomo has made no secret of his political allegiance, and he\ntold reporters after Tuesday's Assembly hearing that ``Hillary\nRodham Clinton will be the next senator from New York.'' But in his\ntestimony and in subsequent interviews, he insisted that the\ndecision to take away the city's control of the program for the\nhomeless was in response to the recent court decision and other\ncomplaints.\n\n   On Nov. 12, Judge Allen G. Schwartz of Federal District Court in\nManhattan ruled that city officials had penalized an AIDS service\norganization, Housing Works, for its attacks on the mayor, and\nlowered the group's score on a list that prioritizes the city's\nneeds in regard to homeless services, making it impossible for the\ngroup to win funding.\n\n   The Continuum of Care Program provides grants to local nonprofit\nsocial service organizations for a variety of programs that assist\nthe homeless, including outreach and prevention efforts, job\ntraining, counseling and rent subsidies. Housing Works had sought\n$2.4 million for programs for homeless people with AIDS, mental\nillness or drug addiction.\n\n   The federal housing agency awards the grants each year based on\na ranking of potential projects that is developed by the city in\nconsultation with an advisory group of social service providers.\nThe city is informed beforehand how much money is available so\nofficials are in a position to know which projects will receive\nfunding as they develop the list.\n\n   The Housing Works programs had initially received scores that\nput them 30th and 33rd out of 71 New York City projects, according\nto court evidence. Later the city lowered those rankings to 57th\nand 60th knowing that the first 56 projects had requested a total\nof $53.9 million out of a total of $54 million available for New\nYork City, Schwartz wrote in his decision.\n\n   ''The Federal District Court judge says in very clear language\nthat the process has been politicized, that the group's criticism\nof the mayor caused them to lose federal funds'' Cuomo said on\nTuesday. ``So once the federal court says the process is not\nworking, that the process is tainted, this department as\nadministrator of those funds must act.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Cuomo said that his agency had received numerous complaints\nsince the program began in 1994 about New York City's role in\nranking projects, including a complaint last year by the Coalition\nfor the Homeless, another group that is frequently critical of\nGiuliani. In a letter to the Coalition in July, housing officials\nsaid the complaint appeared to be justified.\n\n   Giuliani said that Cuomo acted too quickly because the city has\nappealed the Housing Works case. ``We have learned often that cases\nget overturned on appeal,'' he said. ``It happens very very\noften.'' The mayor also pointed to previous allegations of\npolitical dealing against Cuomo, including an investigator's\nfinding last year that housing workers were being used for\npolitical public relations work.\n\n   ''Unfortunately, it's quite apparent that he has brought his\npoliticizing of HUD to New York,'' Giuliani said. ``Now when his\nrepresentative who was the regional director of HUD has become\nHillary Clinton's campaign manager, it appears as if he is trying\nto direct patronage to those people who are his political\nsupporters, possibly Al Gore's and others.''  Â \n\n   Cuomo said he would reconsider his decision if an appeals court\noverturned the ruling by Schwartz. He added the mayor's political\ncharges were an effort to distract people from the real issue of\nthe city's role in awarding federal grants. ''This has always been\na concern that a city could retaliate against homeless groups by\nusing the federal funds and holding them hostage,'' he said. Howard\nWolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, said\nthat she had not been informed in advance about Cuomo's plan. ``We\nhad no involvement in the decision and the mayor's policies speak\nfor itself,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nHUD TAKES AWAY CONTROL OF A HOMELESS PROGRAM FROM NEW YORK CITY \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban\ndevelopment, said on Tuesday that HUD would take direct control of\na program that provides $60 million in federal money for services\nfor the homeless in New York City, because, he said, the\nadministration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could not be trusted to\ndistribute the money fairly.\n","\n   Cuomo, a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York\nSenate race, said his decision was in response to a recent federal\ncourt decision that found that the Giuliani administration had\nimproperly blocked an AIDS service organization from receiving\nfederal money, in retaliation for the organization's frequent\ncriticism of the mayor.\n","\n   ``We cannot allow federal funds to be politicized,'' Cuomo said,\nin announcing at a State Assembly hearing in Manhattan that city\nofficials would no longer be responsible for awarding grants under\nHUD's Homeless Continuum of Care program. ``We're going to remove\nthe city of New York from a position of control of those federal\nfunds.''\n","\n   Giuliani swiftly retaliated, accusing Cuomo of playing politics\nwith the nation's programs for the homeless.
