Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Gores and Clintons shared a stage for two hours\nat the White House Conference on Mental Health on Monday, and took\nturns interviewing people who have struggled with mental illness as\na patient, parent or researcher.\n\n   ``This is the last great stigma of the 20th century that we need\nto make sure ends here and now,'' said Tipper Gore, who ran the\nshow. She recently revealed that she had been clinically depressed\nafter her son, Albert, nearly died when he was hit by a car in 1989\nwhen he was 6. ``I was not myself,'' she said of her own\nexperience, until she sought medical help, including medication.\n``I'm happy to say that it worked.''\n\n   President Clinton asked Congress on Monday to ensure that\nAmericans with mental illness get the same insurance benefits for\ntreating depression as they do for treating physical ailments like\nasthma, and announced that the federal government would now make\nsure that employees are covered for mental illness just as they are\nfor any other malady. On Monday, the government sent a letter to\n285 participating health plans telling them they must comply.\n\n   The president also announced that 1,000 schools would get free\nsatellite programming on dealing with students prone to violence,\nand announced several other programs for mentally ill homeless\npeople, elderly people and young Native American people.\n\n   ``It's been too long since we've come together over something\nthis real that touches so many of us,'' he said, and praised the\nGores by saying that while most politicians talk about family\nvalues, ``no couple in public life has ever done remotely as much\nto try and figure out how to help families.''\n\n   Mrs. Gore is the president's mental health adviser, and bounded\nupon the stage as if pumped as for a political rally, giving the\nthumbs-up and even jumping a little at one point.\n\n   Sitting side by side for two hours, the family dynamic between\nthe Clintons and the Gores, at a time when Al Gore has been\nportrayed as competing with Hillary Clinton as campaign season\napproaches, ranged from supportive to adoring.\n\n   Each nodded attentively at the others' remarks, and Mrs. Gore\nintroduced Hillary Clinton by saying that when it came to shedding\nlight on new research about how the brain works, ``no one could do\nthat any better than the sunshine of all our lives, our first lady,\nHillary Rodham Clinton.''\n\n   Mrs. Clinton returned the compliment by saying, ``If I had any\nvoice I'd break into `You Are the Sunshine of My Life,' and\ndedicate it to Tipper.''\n\n   In her role as moderator, Mrs. Gore choreographed both Clintons\nand her husband, at one point telling the vice president, ``You\nmight want to get up and go over now,'' pointing him toward a\ncorner where he was to interview two more people about their\nexperiences with mental illness.\n\n   ``Yes, ma'am,'' he told her, laughing. ``I'm anxious to follow\ninstructions carefully, but to depart from my destruct _ or, to\ndepart from my instructions, I want to say I hope you can see how\nproud I am of Tipper.''\n\n   Mrs. Gore began the program by interviewing Mike Wallace, of\ntelevision's ``60 Minutes,'' about his experience with depression,\nsitting beside him and repeatedly patting his hand and arm as he\nspoke. When, at one point, Wallace tried to break off, saying, ``I\ndon't want to monopolize this,'' Mrs. Gore urged him to continue,\nsaying, ``It's important because you're a man and you come forward\nand you can help so many men.''\n\n   ``I was in effect on trial for my life, a libel trial,'' Wallace\ntold the crowd, describing the nightmare of spending weeks in a\ncourtroom where the case was being heard, and of being grilled by\nother journalists.\n\n   ``Now, now, we love our friends in the press,'' Mrs. Gore\ninterjected.\n\n   He went on, saying, ``I was lower than a snake's belly,'' and\ndescribed how he took to calling his doctor late at night,\nwondering what was wrong, only to be told, basically, to buck up.\nHe was eventually hospitalized, and after winning the libel case,\nrelapsed because he went off his medicine. Now, on medication ``for\nthe rest of my life, I feel better up here than ever in my life,''\nWallace said, pointing to his head.\n\n   As President and Mrs. Clinton listened intently to the story,\nthey were mirror images of one another, each holding one finger in\nthe crook of their chins.\n\n   Clinton also seemed riveted by the story of a young woman who\nhad battled anorexia, once limiting herself to only 20 calories a\nday, less than half an apple, and doing situps until her back was\ncovered with sores. ``How much weight did you lose?'' the president\nasked her. ``How much did you weigh?''\n\n   When it came Gore's turn to interview a mother whose\neighth-grader has bipolar disorder, he sounded a little like a\ntherapist himself: ``What I hear you saying is that anyone who\ntalks about how important it is for families to stay together and\nbe strong ought to also be supportive of families in these\nsituations.''\n\n   He also spoke to a medical director who found that providing\npreventive treatment and full mental health benefits saved his\ncompany money, and again spoke about how his wife had helped\neducate him on mental health issues over the years.\n\n   Then Mrs. Clinton led a discussion with researchers and Rep.\nLynn Rivers, D-Mich., who said that drugs to treat her bipolar\ndisorder had at one time eaten up half of her family's income.\n\n   Finally, the president spoke, saying he was educated on mental\nillness by reading the work of the novelist William Styron, then\nadding, ``but it is not enough to be moved.''\n\n   ``I sort of feel like an anticlimax at this convention _ and not\nfor the reasons the political reporters think,'' he said, praising\nthose who had told their stories.\n\n   In the afternoon, the Gores hosted what they called a town\nmeeting on the theme of ``busting myths'' about mental illness, and\nGore appeared to go off script to discuss a conversation he had had\nwith a nun at the conference earlier in the day.\n\n   ``Another myth,'' Gore said, ``is that if you pray hard enough,\nif you get your relationship with God in order, that's going to\nhandle this. For those of us who are religious, that's the first\nthing we turn to, but ... if you needed a heart transplant, you\nwouldn't think, `If I just pray harder, it will take the place of a\nnew heart.'
