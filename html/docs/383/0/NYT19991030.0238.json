(mk) \n By PAUL ZIELBAUER   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   TRENTON, N.J. _ When New Jersey investigators filed a lawsuit\nagainst Dr. Lance Gooberman earlier this month that linked his\nunusual heroin detoxification treatment to six patient deaths,\nofficials in the state attorney general's office proclaimed they\nhad stopped an ``unlawful'' treatment that put addicts' lives in\ndanger.\n\n   But the state board responsible for regulating medical\nprocedures knew of Gooberman's treatment well before the first\npatient death in 1995, records show, and though it determined the\nheroin treatment to be ``potentially life threatening'' in 1997,\nseveral months before three more patients died, it did not\nintervene until earlier this month.\n\n   Even though Gooberman disclosed to the state in July 1998 that\none of his patients died shortly after a treatment, investigators\ndid not begin an inquiry until a year later, when he told them\nanother patient had died.\n\n   There were other public warnings about Gooberman's treatment. In\nJuly 1997, he acknowledged after a speech to doctors at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania that three or four of his patients had\ndied, said doctors who attended. More recently, on Aug. 2, the\nAmerican Medical News published an article in which Gooberman\nrevealed that within 48 hours of his treatment, five of his\npatients died, three apparently due to subsequent drug use.\n\n   State officials defend the timing of their investigation by\npointing out that patients die every day, and regulators need firm\nlegal reasons to bar questionable or unsavory treatments. In this\ncase, one death was not enough to force the state to block\nGooberman's unorthodox treatments, said Mark Herr, the director of\nthe state attorney general's division of consumer affairs, which\noversees the state medical board. ``The knowledge of the deaths\ntransformed this from something that needed to be examined to\nsomething that needed a more urgent response,'' Herr said in a\nrecent interview.\n\n   During the state's investigation of Gooberman, who insists he\nhas been singled out unfairly, the doctor's sixth patient died.\nNow, investigators are discreetly looking into the possibility of\nmore deaths related to Gooberman's treatment, a four- to six-hour\noutpatient heroin treatment called ultra-rapid opiate\ndetoxification.\n\n   Gooberman's current troubles offer a glimpse into the\ncontroversy surrounding the growing business of rapid\ndetoxification, an unorthodox treatment for addiction that, in the\nlast five years, has spawned a rush among a handful of doctors to\npatent _ and profit from _ their own versions of a procedure that\nmany doctors believe is unproven and needlessly risky.\n\n   ``We have concerns about its safety,'' said Dr. Alan\nTrachtenberg of the Federal Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,\nin Bethesda, Md. ``What is actually being accomplished by pushing\nsomeone through detox rapidly?''\n\n   What makes ultra-rapid opiate detoxification a subject of debate\nis its speed _ it can be done in as few as four hours, with no\nrequired after care _ and its use of anesthesia to knock patients\nout while doctors feed them a series of intravenous drugs that\nremove the opiates in the brain that cause physical addictions.\n\n   But there is a significant downside to the treatment, which\ncosts up to $8,000. Patients awaken cleansed of opiates, but they\nare not cured of addiction and still face a punishing psychological\nneed for heroin. The drastic chemical changes the patient undergoes\ncan also cause heart and respiratory problems, addiction\nspecialists say. And once they leave the clinic or hospital,\nrelapse is a constant threat.\n\n   To help prevent addicts from relapsing after the treatment,\nGooberman surgically inserts a pellet of a heroin-blocking drug,\nnaltrexone, into their abdomens. The pellet, which the doctor has\npatented along with his detoxification procedure, is meant to\ndissolve over 60 days to block further cravings for narcotics.\n\n   As a result of the state's lawsuit, Gooberman and his partner,\nDr. David Bradway, signed a legal agreement two weeks ago not to\nperform any more detoxifications without the state's permission. He\nis still allowed to insert new naltrexone pellets in his patients,\nwhich include state prisoners, as part of their continuing\ntreatment.\n\n   In July, even as the state attorney general was investigating\nGooberman, the state's Administrative Office of the Courts\ncontracted with him to treat heroin-addicted convicts enrolled in a\nwork-release program, according to documents provided by\nGooberman's lawyer, Alma Saravia.\n\n   Experts estimate that about 10,000 heroin users worldwide have\nundergone anesthetized detoxification since ultra-rapid opiate\ndetoxification was invented in the late 1980s by an Austrian\nphysician. The treatment has been associated with at least 10\ndeaths, including six of Gooberman's patients.\n\n   Even the doctors who advocate the treatment acknowledge a dearth\nof research proving that it works. Many doctors say ultra-rapid\ndetoxification will never take the place of a complete withdrawal\nprogram like methadone.\n\n   Dr. Jim Callahan, the executive vice president of the American\nSociety of Addiction Medicine, equated anesthetized detox to a\nquick fix. ``It runs counter to what we have seen work with people\nwho have chronic histories of opiate addiction,'' he said.\n\n   A federally funded study of ultra-rapid opiate detoxification\nmay soon shed more light on the treatment. The study, started on\nSept. 5 by Dr. Herbert Kleber, the medical director of the National\nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,\nwill track the treatment's effectiveness on 60 heroin addicts over\nthree months.\n\n   Kleber, 65, is an outspoken opponent of commercial one-day\ndetoxification treatments like Gooberman's. He will soon give his\nviews directly to New Jersey's medical board, known as the Board of\nMedical Examiners, which has hired him as an expert witness in\nGooberman's case, Ms. Saravia said.\n\n   nn\n\n   The board passed up several opportunities to halt Gooberman's\nprocedure.\n\n   In an interview on Oct. 19, Herr said the board first heard of\nGooberman and his treatment ``sometime in the last two years.''\nThree days later, Herr amended that, saying the board first learned\nof Gooberman in December 1996 or January 1997.\n\n   But in a letter to Gooberman dated April 19, 1995, and supplied\nto The New York Times by Ms. Saravia, the board said it was aware\nof his detoxification procedure and requested more information\nabout it.\n\n   In November 1997, the board published a set of proposals to\nstrictly regulate anesthesia detoxification, but a year later chose\nto enact a lesser measure governing the use of anesthesia in all\noutpatient treatments.\n\n   By then, five of Gooberman's patients had died.\n\n   Gooberman, a short, stout man with a red beard and pale blue\neyes, says he has been unfairly pursued by state officials. ``The\nwhole time I was doing it,'' he said last week in an interview, ``I\nknew I was doing what's right for the patient.''\n\n   Proponents say the treatment holds out new promise for the\nnation's estimated 810,000 heroin users, especially those for whom\nmethadone has failed.\n\n   Many American physicians believe the treatment has spawned a\ngold-rush mentality among a coterie of doctor-entrepreneurs.\nInstead of sharing their breakthroughs with their peers, their\ncritics say, the doctors have used patents and trademarks to make\nmoney on them.\n\n   They point to a growing list of physician-owned businesses with\nnames like U.S. Detox, which Gooberman controls, and Intensive\nNarcotic Detoxification Centers of America, of Tolland, Conn., a\ncompany founded by Dr. David Simon, an anesthesiologist who\nrecently trademarked the phrases ``intensive narcotic\ndetoxification'' and the more catchy ``kick in your sleep.''\n\n   Of course, the business of heroin detoxification would be\nnothing without a steady supply of customers. Driving the demand\nfor the anesthetized detox treatment is an emerging kind of heroin\naddict: middle-class suburban youth.\n\n   ``What I'm seeing now is kids and parents that are desperate,''\nsaid Gooberman, 48, of Haddonfield, N.J., near Philadelphia. Since\n1994, he has detoxified 2,150 patients, he said, many of whom are\nteen-agers who arrive at his clinic with a parent in tow.\n\n   With Gooberman's treatment on hold pending a ruling from the\nstate's Board of Medical Examiners, the rapid detoxification market\nin the metropolitan region is left to two others: Simon in\nConnecticut and Bennett Oppenheim, a clinical psychologist who runs\nUltraMed International of Fort Lee, N.J.\n\n   Oppenheim began his business last year, after a clinic he ran at\nMetropolitan Hospital in Harlem with the help of two Israeli\npartners was closed by New York City's Health and Hospitals Corp.\nwhen its contract expired in August 1998.\n\n   The Israelis, David Yerushalmi and his brother-in-law, Dr. Andre\nWaismann, are notable because they were the first to trademark the\nphrase ``ultra-rapid opiate detoxification'' and, through their now\ndefunct company, CITA Americas, performed the $7,000 procedure on\naddicts in prestigious hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami,\nOppenheim said.\n\n   Each man has since struck out on his own. Oppenheim is now\npaired with a different physician, a different name for his\ntreatment and a new venue, at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood,\nN.J.\n\n   All this medical entrepreneurship worries some doctors.\n\n   ``The chance to make a profit has stimulated its growth more\nthan its effectiveness,'' said Dr. Joseph Volpicelli, a\npsychiatrist in the University of Pennsylvania's medical school who\nhas studied anesthetized detox treatments. ``It may be the wave of\nthe future and that's how medical companies will make their\nprofits,'' he said, reflecting on the wave of patents in recent\nyears. ``But that would be a shame.''\n\n   The American Medical Association strongly advises its members\nnot to patent medical procedures, saying patents represent\n``substantial risks to the effective practice of medicine.''\nFurthermore, federal law forbids doctors to enforce patents on\nmedical procedures, said Dr. Nancy Dickey, a former AMA president.\n\n   But doctors like Simon in Connecticut, who recently sued another\nheroin detox concern for using his treatment method, dismiss such\ncriticism as babbittry from doctors wedded to methadone treatments.\n\n   ``The psychiatrists don't want to replace five days of inpatient\ndetox, which they manage, with one day of outpatient detox''\nperformed by anesthesiologists like him, Simon said.\n\n   Gooberman's formal response to the New Jersey medical board is\ndue Nov. 10, Ms. Saravia said. After that, the board has 30 days to\ndecide whether to revoke his medical license or refer the matter to\na state judge, she said.\n\n   Gooberman said he hopes to be back in the rapid-detox business\nsoon. ``We have to offer drug addicts more options,'' he said,\n``not less.''\n","Headline":"\nDOCTOR'S WOES SPOTLIGHT DEBATE OVER RAPID DETOXIFICATION \n","Text":["\n   TRENTON, N.J. _ When New Jersey investigators filed a lawsuit\nagainst Dr. Lance Gooberman earlier this month that linked his\nunusual heroin detoxification treatment to six patient deaths,\nofficials in the state attorney general's office proclaimed they\nhad stopped an ``unlawful'' treatment that put addicts' lives in\ndanger.\n","\n   But the state board responsible for regulating medical\nprocedures knew of Gooberman's treatment well before the first\npatient death in 1995, records show, and though it determined the\nheroin treatment to be ``potentially life threatening'' in 1997,\nseveral months before three more patients died, it did not\nintervene until earlier this month.\n","\n   Even though Gooberman disclosed to the state in July 1998 that\none of his patients died shortly after a treatment, investigators\ndid not begin an inquiry until a year later, when he told them\nanother patient had died.\n","\n   There were other public warnings about Gooberman's treatment.
