They are helping in an\ninternational movement to let Third World nations make cut-rate\ncopies of the life-saving drugs.\n\n   ``When you are no longer burying your friends, you have the\nluxury of time to try to save people in more remote areas,'' said\nSawyer, a co-founder of ACT UP/New York. ``There is a tremendous\nsense of survivor guilt, which gives us inspiration to fight\nharder.''\n\n   The problem is this: At Western market prices of $1,000 a month,\nthe multidrug therapies are hopelessly out of reach in the very\ncountries hit hardest by the epidemic _ in African and other\ndeveloping nations where 90 percent of AIDS cases occur.\n\n   Activists such as Sawyer, director of a new group called the\nHIV/AIDS and Human Rights Project, think they have found a\nsolution:\n\n   By declaring health emergencies, impoverished countries could\nsidestep patent laws and produce or import these drugs at a\nfraction of the cost, making them available to millions of\ndestitute AIDS victims _ a market that big drug companies would\nnever touch.\n\n   But the quest to flood Africa with cheap AIDS drugs has run\nheadlong into conflict with American trade policy. High level\nClinton administration officials are blocking attempts to tamper\nwith AIDS drug patents, saying that they undermine the entire\nsystem of intellectual property protection that encourages\nbusinesses to find new drugs.\n\n   One of the best examples of this new front in the battle over\nAIDS drugs is South Africa, where a recently enacted law would\noverride pharmaceutical company patents and allow ``gray market''\nimports of cheap drugs from other countries.\n\n   Prescription drug prices vary dramatically from country to\ncountry, based on deals cut by the manufacturer. The antibiotic\nAmoxicillin, for example, costs 50 cents a pill in Johannesburg, 4\ncents in Zimbabwe. The South African law would let the country\npursue the lowest cost drugs on the world market.\n\n   But court challenges have delayed the law's being put into\neffect. Also, U.S. officials are threatening trade sanctions. One\nState Department memo to Congress boasted of a ``full court press''\ninvolving the Vice President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary William\nDaley and four U.S. agencies to change the ``offending'' law.\n\n   ``The U.S. government has ... made it clear that it will defend\nthe legitimate interests and rights of U.S. pharmaceutical firms,''\nwrote State Department assistant secretary Barbara Larkin in her\nletter to Congress.\n\n   Veteran AIDS activists are angry. The Clinton administration,\nthey charge, seems content to let multinational drug companies set\nAmerican trade policy _ which is threatening access to life-saving\nmedicines, not only in South Africa, but also in Thailand, India\nand poor countries around the world.\n\n   ``Pharmacy companies are making U.S. government policy with\nessentially no other voices. That has to change,'' said John James,\neditor of the respected San Francisco newsletter AIDS Treatment\nNews.\n\n   Drug companies have all but ignored markets in Africa. Less than\n1 percent of AIDS drugs are sold in African nations south of the\nSahara Desert, where 70 percent of new HIV infections and 90\npercent of all AIDS deaths occur. Some 11.5 million people in\nsub-Saharan Africa have died of AIDS since the epidemic began.\n\n   Dr. Ian Roberts, special adviser to the South African Health\nMinistry, said the United States is showing little understanding of\nhis country's public health catastrophe. ``Medicines to treat\nHIV/AIDS are far too highly priced for the mass of our people,'' he\nsaid. ``With up to 16 percent of our people already HIV positive,\nthis can be seen as a national disaster.''\n\n   Despite South Africa's gold and diamond mines, most of its\npeople remain poor, with an average annual income of $2,600.\n``Clearly, we cannot afford retrovirals at a cost of $1,000 per\nmonth,'' said Roberts.\n\n   South Africa has emerged from the shadow of apartheid only to\nbecome a major center of the AIDS epidemic. An estimated 3.2\nmillion South Africans are infected by the virus, including 45\npercent of the nation's military personnel. Most of those infected\nare poor and black.\n\n   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who was drawn to the issue\nbecause of his long-standing interest in pharmaceutical regulation,\ncalled the Clinton position on South Africa ``an affront to the\nsovereignty of Third World nations.''\n\n   In a sharply worded letter to Gore, who chairs a commission on\nSouth African trade, Nader accused the United States of abusing its\nsuperpower status: ``You have engaged in an astonishing array of\nbullying tactics to prevent South Africa from implementing policies\n... designed to expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs.''\n\n   Nader's Consumer Project on Technology advocates two steps _\nboth of them legal under international law _ by which poor\ncountries can slash the cost of AIDS drugs. The first is for poor\ncountries to issue ``compulsory licenses,'' granting rights to make\ncopies of patented drugs without the approval of the patent holder.\nCompulsory licenses are permitted in health emergencies under\ninternational trade agreements.\n\n   The second step is to allow countries to shop around on the\ninternational market for AIDS drugs and import the cheapest\navailable. Forbidden in the United States, such ``parallel market''\nor ``gray market'' purchases are routinely permitted in Europe.\n\n   ``Compulsory licensing will have huge effects on price, leading\nto decreases of 50 to 90 percent,'' said James Love, director of\nthe Consumer Project on Technology.\n\n   But the pharmaceutical industry and the Clinton administration\ntake the view that compulsory licenses and gray markets pose a\nthreat to the entire system of intellectual property protection.\nAccess to AIDS drugs, they say, can be solved without destroying\nthe patent system.\n\n   ``Patents are the lifeblood of our industry,'' said David Warr,\nassociate director of tax and trade policy at Bristol-Myers Squibb,\nthe New York-based maker of an array of drugs to treat AIDS and\nAIDS-related infections. ``Compulsory licensing and parallel\nimports expropriate our patent rights.''\n\n   The only beneficiary of an erosion of patent rights, said Warr,\nis the generic drug industry, which does not subsidize through its\nsales the costly process of research _ research that makes new\ntop-of-the-line therapies available. ``There is a need not to fight\nthe firefighters,'' he said.\n\n   Drug makers stress that even if AIDS medications were magically\nmade cheaper for the African market, the lack of an infrastructure\nto distribute the drugs and monitor patients means that few would\nbenefit.\n\n   Tom Bombelles, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers Association, said patents are not the problem. Access\nto AIDS drugs remains a desperate problem in India, which does not\nrecognize international drug patents and where manufacturers make\nlow-cost generic versions of AIDS drugs.\n\n   Experts in the international AIDS crisis agree that merely\nlowering the price of AIDS drugs will not solve the problem, and\npotentially could make the epidemic worse.\n\n   ``If you spread anti-HIV drugs in a population, but not in\nsufficient quantities, you are establishing a recipe for disaster.\nYou could make people sicker, rather than better, and increase the\npossibility for development of drug-resistant HIV strains,'' said\nTom Coates, executive director of the University of California at\nSan Francisco AIDS Research Institute.\n\n   Coates said the limited money available to fight AIDS in Africa\nwould save the most lives if it were directed at prevention first.\nMost African nations do not even have funds to pay for testing of\nthe blood supply, and in 1997, only $650 million was spent on all\nAfrican AIDS programs. ``If, as UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS) has suggested, we raised spending to $2.5\nbillion, we could prevent half the HIV infections from occurring,''\nCoates said.\n\n   By raising the patent issue, however, activists believe they are\nalready nudging the international pharmaceutical industry to pay\nmore attention to Africa. This month, Bristol-Myers Squibb\nannounced a five-year, $100 million project to test AIDS drugs and\nimprove physician training in five African nations, including South\nAfrica.\n\n   But angry South African officials have dismissed the drug\ncompany program as misplaced. The country does not have doctors to\nspare for training in the United States, said Roberts, the adviser\nto the South African Health Ministry. And critics consider the\noffer a public relations ploy. ``They are getting billions more\nthan they should with their monopoly, so they send back a tip,''\nsniffed Nader.\n\n   The size of the Bristol-Myers grant has nevertheless upped the\nante in the international response to the AIDS catastrophe in\nAfrica.\n\n   The controversies swirling around U.S. trade policies indicates\nthat a new front has been opened in the global war on AIDS. Even as\nnew AIDS medicines save lives in the United States, they serve to\nunderscore the appalling medical gap between rich nations and poor.\n\n   Daniel Zingale, executive director of the AIDS Action Council,\nthe nation's largest lobby on HIV issues, said the trade issues\nraised by Nader are looming larger. ``In my view, on this issue,\nRalph Nader is right,'' he said. ``It's clear to us the pricing of\nAIDS drugs is not fair or serving the interests of most people\ninfected by HIV.''\n\n   The effect of American trade policy on the availability of AIDS\ndrugs has already struck a chord on Capitol Hill. Rep. Jesse\nJackson Jr., D-Ill., has introduced an African trade bill that bars\nU.S. trade sanctions against countries that use compulsory\nlicensing or parallel imports.\n\n   And Rep. Marion Berry, an Arkansas Democrat and the only\nlicensed pharmacist in Congress _ who has long been a thorn in the\nside of U.S. drugmakers _ is winning support with his criticism of\nthe Clinton administration stand.\n\n   Last week, he introduced a bill, with Republican Jo Ann Emerson\nof Missouri as co-author, that would allow American wholesalers to\nimport drugs sold in Mexico or Canada at lower prices than those\nset by pharmaceutical companies for the U.S. market.\n\n   ``We're in favor of these companies making a profit,'' Berry\nsaid in a recent telephone interview. ``We all want them to make as\nmuch money as possibly can. But when they make money at the expense\nof someone dying, because they can't afford to buy the medicine _\nwell, then it becomes a moral issue.''\n","Headline":"\nCRUSADE AIMS TO LOWER AIDS DRUGS COST\n","Text":["\n   The payoff is an array of costly new pills that since 1996 have\nhelped slash the American AIDS death rate in half, and restored\nvigor and good health to Sawyer and tens of thousands like him.\n","\n   Now a new cause is tapping the fresh energy and political\ninstincts of American AIDS veterans, whose work succeeded in\nchanging U.S. drug approval policy.
