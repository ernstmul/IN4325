Times News Service clients)  \n By MIKE MCCLOY  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Supreme Court says hundreds of drug\nabusers have been cleaned up and more than $2.5 million in prison\ncosts have been saved by the state's new medical marijuana law.\n\n   But a top aide to Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley says\nProposition 200 is doing a less effective job than the decade-old\n``Do Drugs, Do Time'' diversion program.\n\n   Approved by the voters in 1996, Proposition 200 provided more\nthan $2 million in liquor tax money last fiscal year for treatment.\nThe law requires probation instead of prison for non-violent first-\nand second-time drug offenders.\n\n   The Drug Treatment and Education Fund kept 551 people from going\nto prison _ saving taxpayers $50 a day for each of them, according\nto the report by the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n\n   But Barnett Lotstein, special assistant to the county attorney,\nsaid these people would not have gone to prison anyway.\n\n   ``No one is sent to prison for mere possession of drugs,''\nLotstein said. ``The savings are illusory.''\n\n   The report says another 2,071 people on probation under\nprovisions other than Proposition 200 received drug treatment\nfunded by the new law between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.\n\n   About 61 percent of the total completed drug treatment\nsuccessfully, and they did not disappear, get arrested or have\ntheir probation revoked.\n\n   ``It looks like an A-plus to me,'' said Sam Vagenas, director of\nArizonans for Drug Policy Reform, who coordinated the Proposition\n200 initiative campaign.\n\n   But Lotstein said the 61 percent success rate is questionable.\n\n   ``What happened to the other 39 percent?'' he asked. ``Did they\njust thumb their nose at the system? Under Proposition 200, they\ncan't be put in prison.''\n\n   Under ``Do Drugs, Do Time,'' those who failed to complete\ntreatment faced a prison term, Lotstein said. And he claimed a 92\npercent success rate, saying only 8 percent were rearrested within\ntwo years of completing that diversion program.\n\n   The Supreme Court report, required by Proposition 200, did not\ncompare programs. Analysts found that more than 77 percent of\nparticipants in drug treatment under Proposition 200 had clean\nurine samples when tested. The same percentage made at least one\nrequired co-payment for services.\n\n   ``Arizona is in the forefront,'' said Chuck Blanchard, a former\nstate lawmaker from Phoenix who now is the top attorney for the\nWhite House Office of National Drug Control Policy. He said the\nSupreme Court report on Proposition 200 is sound.\n\n   ``This is something that was forced on them by Proposition\n200,'' Blanchard said. ``The fact that it's a positive report can\nbe taken seriously.''\n\n   Norman Helber, Maricopa County's chief adult probation officer,\nsaid Proposition 200 provides alternatives other than jail or\nprison when probationers abuse drugs.\n\n   ``We used to tell them, `We can put you in jail in a week or\nprison in a month but residential treatment _ it's a six- to\neight-month wait,' '' Helber said.\n\n   ``The wealthy went to Betty Ford (treatment center), and the\npoor went to jail. Now we've got money for the people who can't pay\nfor treatment.''\n\n   Proposition 200 requires that drug abusers be screened for\npsychological problems, literacy and other needs, and that only\nproven treatment programs be used. The Supreme Court found that the\nrecommended treatment was provided in 98 percent of all cases.\n\n   ``We're in the driver's seat,'' Helber proclaimed. But he said\nProposition 200 should be expanded to require treatment in prisons.\n\n   An estimated 20,000 of the 26,000 inmates in Arizona prisons are\ndrug abusers, but no law requires treatment, said Gail Rittenhouse\nof the Department of Corrections.\n","Headline":"\nDRUG TREATMENT LAW WORKS, SUPREME COURT STUDY SAYS \n","Text":["\n   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Supreme Court says hundreds of drug\nabusers have been cleaned up and more than $2.5 million in prison\ncosts have been saved by the state's new medical marijuana law.\n","\n   But a top aide to Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley says\nProposition 200 is doing a less effective job than the decade-old\n``Do Drugs, Do Time'' diversion program.\n","\n   Approved by the voters in 1996, Proposition 200 provided more\nthan $2 million in liquor tax money last fiscal year for treatment.\nThe law requires probation instead of prison for non-violent first-\nand second-time drug offenders.\n","\n   The Drug Treatment and Education Fund kept 551 people from going\nto prison _ saving taxpayers $50 a day for each of them, according\nto the report by the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n","\n   But Barnett Lotstein, special assistant to the county attorney,\nsaid these people would not have gone to prison anyway.\n","\n   ``No one is sent to prison for mere possession of drugs,''\nLotstein said. ``The savings are illusory.''\n","\n   The report says another 2,071 people on probation under\nprovisions other than Proposition 200 received drug treatment\nfunded by the new law between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.\n","\n   About 61 percent of the total completed drug treatment\nsuccessfully, and they did not disappear, get arrested or have\ntheir probation revoked.\n","\n   ``It looks like an A-plus to me,'' said Sam Vagenas, director of\nArizonans for Drug Policy Reform, who coordinated the Proposition\n200 initiative campaign.\n","\n   But Lotstein said the 61 percent success rate is questionable.\n","\n   ``What happened to the other 39 percent?'' he asked. ``Did they\njust thumb their nose at the system?
