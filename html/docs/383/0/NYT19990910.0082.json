Gray Davis.\n\n   In the final hours of the 1999 legislative session, which ended\nFriday, lawmakers hurriedly wrote and amended several HMO-reform\nmeasures Davis proposed only three weeks ago.

Despite his misgivings, Davis is\nexpected to sign the bill.\n\n   One of the most significant bills requires HMOs to pay for\nmental health drugs for adults and children.\n\n   The mandate would cover schizophrenia, manic depression,\nobsessive-compulsiveness, anorexia and bulimia, among other severe\nmental illnesses in the measure.\n\n   ``As a brother of a schizophrenia patient, I have been waiting\nfor this for a long time,'' said State Sen. Don Perata, a Democrat\nfrom Oakland. ``Finally, we have to acknowledge that the biological\ncauses of mental illness are no different than those of other\ndiseases.''\n\n   Lawmakers also approved a measure giving patients the right to\nhave an independent doctor review medical decisions by HMOs if\ntreatment is delayed or refused.\n\n   A separate bill requires HMOs to pay for a second medical\nopinion if the patients don't like the advice they get from their\nprimary doctor.\n\n   The external review system would be run by the state. Six other\nstates have external review systems, and reviewers in those states\nhave supported patients' demands 90 percent of the time, according\nto one study.\n\n   ``Right now if you pay for health care at enormous cost and\nyou're denied something, you just have to grouse about it and\nsuffer in silence,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat\nfrom San Francisco and author of the measure. ``This gives an\noption for a patient to seek accountability.''\n\n   But the most debated and lobbied health care bill of the session\nwould let patients sue their HMOs if they suffer substantial\nphysical or financial harm because of an HMO decision to deny or\ndelay care.\n\n   Consumers could only sue after exhausting all other options\nthrough independent review, and could only seek damages if they\nwere denied medically necessary treatment, rather than a broader\nmedically appropriate standard sought by some consumer advocates.\n\n   ``More than any other reform this year, this legislation helps\nto even the grossly skewed balance of power between patients and\ntheir HMOs,'' said Jaime Court, a consumer and trial attorney\nadvocate monitoring HMO legislation. ``Seriously harmed patients\nwill now have a big stick to wave at their HMO. Hopefully, they\nwill never have to use it.''\n\n   HMO industry spokespeople said it was disappointed with the\nliability bill because of last-minute amendments. Those would allow\npatients to skip the external review system and sue HMOs if they\npaid for medical services out of their own pockets and were already\nsubstantially harmed by an illness the HMO wouldn't cover.\n\n   ``We don't think that's what the governor had in mind,'' said\nWalter Zelman, chief executive of the California Association of\nHealth Plans, the central HMO lobbying group. ``We hope to clean\nthat up through the legislative process next year.''\n\n   The Legislature also approved a measure requiring HMOs to\napprove or deny medical care within five days in most cases and\nwithin 72 hours for urgent procedures.
