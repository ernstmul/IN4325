Times News Service    \n\n   ALBANY, New York _ Gov. George Pataki announced Tuesday a plan\nto stop the decades-old practice of emptying its huge psychiatric\nhospitals and called for spending an additional $125 million for\nsupervised housing and other community-based services for the\nmentally ill.\n\n   The policy shift would temporarily suspend the mandate that\nhospital administrators have faced for years to reduce their\ninpatient hospital populations. That mandate has frequently forced\nadministrators to discharge patients who in many cases pose a\nthreat to themselves or others.\n\n   Taken together, the proposals represent the most comprehensive\nplan in recent memory to plug holes in a system that critics say\nhas been cynically used by the state to trim hundreds of millions\nfrom its budget at the expense of mentally ill people who have been\ndischarged onto the streets with little or no supervision.\n\n   A series of violent attacks committed by mentally ill people\ndischarged from state mental hospitals has cast a stark spotlight\non the issue, and fueled intense criticism of Pataki's\nadministration. Mental health advocates have pointed to budget cuts\nthat year after year have reduced critical support networks that\nallowed some of the mentally ill to survive outside psychiatric\ninstitutions.\n\n   Most recently, the state has come under fire in the case of\nAndrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic man who shoved Kendra Webdale in\nfront of a New York City subway car last January, killing her.\nGoldstein had tried to get help before the attack but was turned\naway again and again by the state's troubled and overburdened\nmental health system. His criminal case ended in a mistrial last\nweek after a jury deadlocked over whether Goldstein's behavior met\nthe legal definition of insanity when he killed Ms. Webdale.\n\n   The governor specifically cited Goldstein's case in\nacknowledging the problems in the state's mental health system.\n\n   ``I will tell you that I am personally shocked when something\nlike this happens,'' Pataki told reporters during a news conference\nat the Capitol. ``Whenever there is an incident like this, I take a\nlook and think: My goodness. What can we as a people _ what can I\nas a governor _ do to protect individuals from themselves and to\nprotect us as a society?''\n\n   The state spends $4.2 billion a year on mental health, with\nabout $2.3 billion of that going toward community-based programs,\ngroup homes, supervised housing and expensive, short-term care in\nlocal hospitals. The $125 million would be parceled out, with $52\nmillion geared toward case managers and $20 million set to pay for\n2,000 new housing units, with the rest divided among a variety of\nprograms.\n\n   While the additional money, which requires approval by the state\nLegislature, is a small part of the overall budget for mental\nhealth, some advocates say the governor has financed just 200 new\nsupervised housing units for the mentally ill during his first four\nyears in office.\n\n   Pataki's proposal also called for temporarily halting the\nstate's longstanding policy of deinstitutionalization, a practice\nthat has systematically discharged thousands and thousands of\nmental patients from the state's big psychiatric hospitals. Moving\npatients into group homes and community-based services began in the\n1950s as a response to public outrage over the deplorable\nconditions and neglect uncovered in some of the larger institutions\nand in response to a growing awareness of more humane treatments\nfor the mentally ill.\n\n   In recent years, though, the policy is widely believed to have\nbeen a significant factor in the growth of homelessness, as\nfinancing and community-based housing failed to keep pace.\n\n   In 1953, 93,000 patients lived in New York's state mental\nhospitals. Deinstitutionalization has decreased that number to\n6,000 patients, the majority of whom are seriously mentally ill,\nand, in many cases, criminally insane and prone to violence.\n\n   Under the plan announced Tuesday, the state would set aside, for\none year, its goal of reducing the mental hospital population to as\nlow as 3,700 and would adjust spending projections at the hospitals\nso that financing would stay the same to care for the higher number\nof patients during the yearlong hiatus.\n\n   While mental health systems vary from state to state, the effort\nto empty publicly financed psychiatric hospitals has spread across\nthe nation over the last 20 to 30 years. But like New York, many\nstates have found in recent years that the effort has led to\nproblems like increased homelessness and incarceration among the\nmentally ill, many of whom found themselves discharged without\nadequate community supports.\n\n   As a result, the fastest-growing part of mental health budgets\nin most states has been for programs in prisons and jails,\naccording to Clarence J. Sundram, a mental health expert who was\nthe head of the state's Commission on Quality of Care for the\nMentally Disabled.\n\n   Mental health advocates in New York State said Tuesday that they\nwere surprised by the governor's announcement and they praised his\ndecision.\n\n   Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees\nAssociation, which represents 9,000 workers at state psychiatric\nhospitals, said the change came at a crucial time. He said many of\nthe patients who remained in the state's psychiatric hospitals\ncould not be easily discharged, given the severity of their\nillness.\n\n   ``We are stunned,'' he said. ``On the face of it, this is very\nwelcome. It is as if the administration is finally recognizing the\nreality that we have been talking about for years. A lot of these\npatients need long-term care and supervision that can be best\nprovided in a hospital setting.''\n\n   The $20 million planned for the 2,000 new supervised housing\nunits will come from federal, state and local governments, with\ntwo-thirds provided by the state.\n\n   But the plan falls short of the number of apartments that\nsupporters and even the state itself say is needed. In the\nmid-1990s, for example, the state's Office of Mental Health\nconducted a survey that determined the state could use between\n35,000 and 40,000 units of housing for mentally ill people.\nCurrently, the state provides only 21,000 supervised community\nbeds.\n\n   Nor does the plan include financing for permanent housing with\n24-hour supervision. Critics of the state's mental health policies\nsay this type of housing is critically important for seriously ill\npatients like Goldstein, if they are expected to function outside\npsychiatric hospitals. A draft report of a new state investigation\nhas concluded that the mental health system spent nearly $100,000 a\nyear to treat him through repeated short-time hospital stays when\nhe needed the less costly combination of supervised housing and\ndaily visits from a case manager.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Administration officials note that their plan will free up much\nof the existing 24-hour supervised housing that currently exists.\n\n   Shelly Nortz, director of policy for the Coalition for the\nHomeless, called the governor's plan a step in the right direction,\nbut added that it does not fully address the overall need of New\nYork's mentally ill. Ms. Nortz said that in New York City alone,\nroughly 10,000 homeless mentally ill people need some sort of\nstate-funded supervised housing.\n\n   ``We are very encouraged that the governor is now inching his\nway toward meeting the housing need for this vulnerable\npopulation,'' she said. ``We are now moving from the point where\nthis administration was cutting service to the mentally ill to a\npoint where the governor is taking this issue seriously and adding\nthe resources that are long overdue.''\n\n   The housing proposal comes seven months after Pataki and Mayor\nRudolph Giuliani reached a compromise on expanding a landmark\nprogram for housing mentally ill homeless people in New York City.\nThe agreement, known as New York-New York II, requires that the\ncity and state spend slightly more than $100 million to provide\n1,500 apartments for mentally ill homeless people over the next\nfive years. But that figure falls short of the number of apartments\nthat supporters of the program had sought.\n\n   In the governor's announcement Tuesday, he called for increased\nfinancing of $52 million for new case managers, a move that mental\nhealth advocates say was critically important if the state hopes to\nadequately monitor patients assigned to the new units that the\nadministration now plans to finance.\n\n   While administration officials could not say how many new case\nmanagers would be hired, they estimated that the number of mentally\nill people receiving case management services would increase to\n25,000 from 15,600.
