Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ A homeless man accused of pushing a commuter into the\npath of an oncoming subway train Wednesday has a history of mental\nillness and told detectives that he spent the day of the attack\nroaming city streets, convinced people were trying to kill him, a\npolice official said Thursday.\n\n   But investigators said they had found no evidence that Julio\nPerez, 43, had committed any acts of serious violence before\npushing Edgar Rivera, 46, onto the tracks of the busy station at\n51st Street in midtown Manhattan. The train severed Rivera's legs,\nbut he survived and was in critical but stable condition Thursday\nat Bellevue Hospital Center, said Lorinda Klein, a hospital\nspokeswoman.\n\n   Rivera's wife, Elizabeth, kept a vigil through early Thursday\nmorning while doctors tried unsuccessfully to reattach his legs.\nFriends and neighbors in the Soundview section of the Bronx who\nheard about the attack described Rivera, a printer, as athletic,\nand intensely devoted and attentive to his wife and three children.\n\n   Perez was arraigned Thursday on charges of attempted murder and\nassault.

The\nauthorities said he had been convicted three times for fare-beating\nand twice for possessing small amounts marijuana. He was arrested\nin 1996 for aggravated harassment, robbery and weapons possession,\npolice said, but a check of his criminal record found no\ndisposition of that case.\n\n   For more than a year, Perez has been in the Fort Washington\nMen's Shelter, a 200-bed facility in upper Manhattan, where he\nlived in a shelter within the shelter serving 40 mentally ill men\nrun by Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center called Critical Time\nIntervention.\n\n   ``He slept in our shelter the night before this happened,'' said\nMartin Oesterreich, the new commissioner of the city's Department\nof Homeless Services. ``You can't cover every eventuality.\nObviously the system didn't work well if we aren't able to prevent\nthis kind of thing. You have a tragedy like this, it makes you\nre-examine everything.''\n\n   Although the details of Perez's situation were far from clear\nThursday _ there remained questions about whether he had been\ntaking his medicine, for example, and whether he had been receptive\nto treatment or had been let down by the system in any way _ the\nincident revived the debate over whether the state's laws\nconcerning the mentally ill should be overhauled.\n\n   It is a debate that began gathering momentum three months ago\nafter a similar incident: the death of Kendra Webdale, who police\nsaid was killed by a subway train after being pushed onto the\ntracks by Andrew Goldstein, a 29-year-old with a history of mental\nillness. That case led state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to\npropose a new law that would enable relatives and doctors to compel\nmentally ill people to receive treatment and medication.\n\n   Under current state law, people must be judged both mentally ill\nand a danger to themselves or others before they can be committed\nagainst their will to short-term hospitalizations or longer stays\nin institutions.\n\n   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Perez's case highlighted the need\nfor earlier intervention. ``It certainly indicates a real gap in\nthe way that we deal with serious, violent mentally ill people,''\nhe said, ``in that we allow them access to the streets for far\nlonger, and under circumstances where hopefully that won't be the\ncase in the future.''\n","Headline":"\nSUBWAY PUSHING SUSPECT HAS HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS, POLICE SAY \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ A homeless man accused of pushing a commuter into the\npath of an oncoming subway train Wednesday has a history of mental\nillness and told detectives that he spent the day of the attack\nroaming city streets, convinced people were trying to kill him, a\npolice official said Thursday.\n","\n   But investigators said they had found no evidence that Julio\nPerez, 43, had committed any acts of serious violence before\npushing Edgar Rivera, 46, onto the tracks of the busy station at\n51st Street in midtown Manhattan.
