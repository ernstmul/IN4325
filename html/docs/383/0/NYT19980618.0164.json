Houston Chronicle \n\n   HOUSTON _ For nearly 15 years, Rosalynn Carter has pounded nails\nwith Jimmy at his annual Habitat for Humanity Work Project. This\nyear, she's not hammering. She's got a medical excuse, and it isn't\nthe Houston heat.\n\n   The former first lady has carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.\nShe flexes her right wrist, demonstrating therapeutic exercises\nshe's been doing since last fall. She'd like to give hammering a\ntry, but she's afraid to risk the small, hard-won improvement she's\nmade.\n\n   After all these years with Habitat, Carter lays claim to being a\npretty fair carpenter, and has worked on almost every aspect of\nhome construction.\n\n   ``I don't get on the roof,'' she said, with a hint of\nconfession. But on the first day of the weeklong project here, she\nhas worked as a carpenter's helper alongside her husband.\n\n   Not 10 minutes after concluding her interviews in a small,\ntrying-to-be-air-conditioned press trailer, which is as close to\ncool as it gets at the Houston site, Rosalynn is back on the job,\nready to hand a section of 2-by-4 to Jimmy who's nailing in a\nwindow header. It's 5 o'clock, but it isn't quitting time until the\ntar paper and roof sheeting go up, and the face of the 39th\npresident of the United States has a four-alarm flush.\n\n   ``I'm worried about him,'' said LeRoy Troyer, an Indiana\narchitect who volunteers each year, coordinating the work at the\nhouse Jimmy and Rosalynn help build. ``It isn't any hotter than it\nwas in Charlotte, but he's older. I won't put him on the roof\ntoday.''\n\n   Their days of roofing may be behind them, but the Carters make\nfew other concessions to age. Actively using the influence,\nknowledge and connections of the presidency for a wide variety of\nhumanitarian causes, they are the pacesetters for a new,\nappealingly vigorous style of retirement.\n\n   Rosalynn's publicity tour on behalf of her most recent book,\n``Helping Someone with Mental Illness'' (Times Books, $24),\nincluded appearances on ``Good Morning, America'' and ``The Tonight\nShow with Jay Leno.'' At all her media stops, Carter heard personal\nstories of depression or bipolar disorder or other illnesses from\nthe famous and not-famous alike.\n\n   ``I'm glad when somebody speaks out about mental illness,''\nCarter said. ``And that they feel like I'll understand.''\n\n   She subtitled the book, ``A Compassionate Guide for Family,\nFriends and Caregivers.'' The voice of compassion warms her prose\nas it softens her air of friendly reserve. And a hint of\nindignation peppers her expression of surprise that stigma about\nmental illness persists so tenaciously.\n\n   ``Why we keep having this stigma I don't know,'' Carter said.\n``I guess it's just too close to home.''\n\n   Combatting stigma has been her personal campaign since she first\nbegan her work on behalf of those with mental illness during the\nyears when her husband was governor of Georgia. In the intervening\nyears, her efforts on behalf of better treatment for the mentally\nill at the White House and through the Carter Center at Atlanta\nalways emphasize reducing the stigma.\n\n   She believes the shame and secretiveness about mental illness\npersist because they arose in an era when no one understood it or\nknew what to do about it. The myths about mental illness melt away,\nshe said, once you understand the facts about its biologic\nunderpinnings.\n\n   In addition to offering suggestions and resources, Carter\nupdates readers on the newest theories arising from the research of\nthe past 10 years, a period designated by George Bush as the Decade\nof the Brain.\n\n   She warns readers that it takes a Ph.D. in biology to understand\nthe workings of the brain, and concludes her introduction to the\nbreakthroughs by wishing the reader luck.\n\n   Every time an editor sent back a draft with ``Good Luck''\nerased, Carter said she penciled it back in. If she were writing\nher 92-year-old mother, she'd no doubt encourage her the same way.\n\n   Researching the workings of the brain challenged her, and\nfinding a way to express them in simple rather than technical\nlanguage was even harder. But understanding the role of\nneurotransmitters is crucial to current medical knowledge about\nthese complex illnesses.\n\n   So Carter persevered in her research. And prevailed with her\neditors. The ``Good Luck'' stands.\n\n   ``It's an exciting time,'' Carter said. ``Now we know so much,\nand there are so many new medications being developed.''\n\n   She brings readers out of the dark ages when it was believed\nmental illness was a curse, and dispels the notion that\nneurobiologic illnesses like schizophrenia have their origins in\npoor parenting.\n\n   Poor parenting can make a child's life more difficult, but\nmodern brain research outlined in the book explains how genetic\nvulnerability and environmental stress interact to induce biologic\ndiseases like depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and\nschizophrenia. In explaining the difference between the sad moods\nwe all fall into and the illness, the book points out that\ndepression is a physical disease. It affects more than mood; it can\nalter sleeping and eating patterns, energy levels and more.\n\n   Carter believes these facts help decrease the shroud of stigma\nthat still prevents people from getting effective treatment for\ndepression. But she's not prepared to leave it at that. Currently,\nshe is brainstorming with others to create a national anti-stigma\ncampaign that might feature prominent figures speaking out about\ntheir personal experiences with depression.\n\n   The book makes a start with human sagas from Rod Steiger, who\nhas lived with major depression, and from Margot Kidder who talks\nabout her nationally publicized episode with bipolar disorder.\n\n   While Carter's book offers resources, including the chapters on\ntreatment, and advice for caregivers, it is the people stories that\nreveal mental illness for the ordinary experience it truly is.\n\n   Ordinary does not mean painless, and the losses are chronicled.\nBut there's something almost reassuring in Carter's conversations\nwith her neighbor from Plains when they meet up in the town\ndrugstore. Or her support of a friend in seeking medication to help\nhim return to the work he still wants to do.\n\n   Carter has begun to expand her work on mental illness beyond\nthis country. A leader in the World Federation for Mental Health,\nCarter is involved in raising awareness of mental health issues in\ndeveloping countries that have no information about the diseases\nand a high prevalence\n\n   While traveling in Africa in her role as the vice-chair of the\nCarter Center, Carter visited an orphanage in Liberia being run\nwith no help by two women who cooked gruel for the children in a\ncan on a brick in the back yard. The mentally ill children received\nno treatment.\n\n   ``It was one of the worst things I've ever seen,'' she said.\n\n   Her work at the Carter Center encompasses many issues in\naddition to mental health, from inner city poverty to election\nmonitoring in developing countries. She co-founded a national\nvaccination program for toddlers. But everywhere, including today\namid the pounding of thousands of hammers, people find her to talk\nabout mental illness.\n\n   A woman told her about her daughter's recent diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder and the doctor's recommendation that she read\nCarter's new book.\n\n   For all her straightforward, down-to-earth qualities, you can't\nmiss a little bit of thrill in her voice.
