SCHMIDT  \n c.2000 Child magazine  \n\n   As a very young child, Alex Fenyn, now 7, exasperated his\nparents and teachers and intimidated peers with his hyperactive and\naggressive behavior. He was extremely cranky as an infant and had a\nbloodcurdling scream that made him sound like he was being\ntortured, says his mother, Tracy McNair, 42, a consultant from New\nYork City. His parents even gave him the nickname ``Mr.\nIntensity.''\n\n   In preschool and kindergarten, he was impulsive and unable to\nsit down. Because Alex's classmates found his behavior so\nfrightening, he was usually left to play by himself.\n\n   The turning point in Alex's life came at age 5, with a clinical\ndiagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a\nprescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a ``miracle\ndrug.''\n\n   ``The effect was immediate,'' she says. ``He had less trouble\ngoing from one activity to the next and would negotiate for a toy\ninstead of grabbing it. After three weeks, his classmates started\nto warm up to him, which is what I was hoping for. I wanted him to\ngain some self-esteem.''\n\n   In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment,\nmillions of children in the United States are taking drugs\nprescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health\nproblems at ever-younger ages. And the number of kids on medication\nis rising.\n\n   A study by Dr. Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland\nSchool of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent\nof American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking\nstimulants such as Ritalin, as well as antidepressants and\nantipsychotics. According to Zito's findings, stimulant use in this\nage group (Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases) rose two- to\nthreefold from 1991 to 1995, while the rate of antidepressant\nprescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period.\n\n   As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric\nproblems, the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem,\nespecially in younger age groups, says Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz,\nvice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York\nUniversity School of Medicine in New York City. ``We have a\ncritical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of\nthese medications in children,'' he says.\n\n   Dr. Jerry Rushton, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan\nSchool of Medicine in Ann Arbor, says that clinicians simply know\nmore about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past\n_ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of\ndiagnoses and prescriptions.\n\n   According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians\nstems in part from mental health research conducted during the\n1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable,\nbiologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur\nin children as young as 2 or 3 years old.\n\n   Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says\nRushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil,\nwhich have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous\ngeneration of antidepressants. They have been increasingly\nprescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating\ndepression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children.\n\n   Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental\nillnesses are actually increasing among children?\n\n   ``For over a decade there have been observations among teachers\nand pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in\nchildren,'' says Dr. Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of\npediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine. ``We don't\nknow if it has to do with changing communities, family structure,\nTV video games or anything else, but there is a perception that\nbehavioral disturbances are on the rise.''\n\n   A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in\nthe years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric\nAssociation in 1980. In 1987, the APA redefined the criteria for\ndiagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or\nimpulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the\ncase. The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD\ndiagnoses.\n\n   Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4\npercent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _\nare now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common\npediatric mental illness in the United States. And according to\nZito, the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked\ndirectly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.\n\n   Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior\nwill likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by\nclinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental\nhealth coverage is concerned.\n\n   ``There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness,\nmanaged care interferes with diagnosis,'' says Dr. Alan Wachtel, a\nclinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center\nin New York City and author of ``The Attention Deficit Disorder\nAnswer Book.''\n\n   Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric\nspecialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and\nencourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather\nthan to try longer-term psychosocial interventions. And, according\nto Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by\nchild psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little\ntraining in mental health.\n\n   By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed\ncare companies are limiting the resources available to\npediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the\nprescription pad.\n\n   Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental\nillness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative\nself-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much\nhigher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later\non in life.\n\n   If you are worried that your pediatrician cannot devote the time\nneeded to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because\nof an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a\nqualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which\nshould include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and\nteachers, and a review of school records and family history.\n\n   Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe\nmedications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a\nway to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed\ncare places on physicians, says Dr. Peter Jensen, the director of\nthe Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at the\nColumbia University School of Medicine in New York City. But, he\nsays, the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of\nthe child's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation\nthat takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the\nchild.\n\n   In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team\nof researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen,\nfollowed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their\nprogress with various forms of treatment. The researchers found\nthat medication was substantially more effective than\nbehavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.\nIn cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as\ndepression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy\nprovided an advantage.\n\n   Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of\nmental illnesses in children is still evolving. Because so few of\nthese studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the\nbenefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to\nemerge.\n\n   Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment\noptions with their pediatrician so they can make an informed\ndecision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.\nAfter the evaluation, he says, ``the critical thing is that you as\na parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and\nrisks of each treatment option under consideration.''\n\n   (Charles W.
