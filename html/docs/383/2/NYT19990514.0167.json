HOWE  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   A condition called ``social anxiety disorder'' this week joined\nthe long list of downers in life _ including obesity, impotence,\nand depression _ that Americans once commonly saw as challenges of\nwillpower and character but can now have treated by popping a pill.\n\n   The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Paxil, a\npopular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive\ndisorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may\nconjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before\nspeaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party.\n\n   But area specialists stressed Thursday that the pill will work\nonly for treating the kind of acute, irrational shyness that\ndevastates people's careers and social lives. Anyone who thinks\ntaking one to feel more confident or convivial in a special\noccasion, they said, will have trouble getting a prescription\nfilled and is bound to be disappointed if they try.\n\n   ``We're not talking about people who are a little anxious about\ngiving a talk or business presentation or feeling a little nervous\nabout meeting strangers,'' said Dr. Mark Pollack, director of the\nAnxiety Disorders Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\n   Rather, Pollack and others said, acute social anxiety involves\nsuch intense and irrational levels of shyness that it leads people\nto shun others, avoid seeking promotions at work, drop out of\nschool, or feel terror at the prospect of signing a check in public\nor using a public restroom. Some people resort to alcohol or drugs\nto stave off the feelings.\n\n   Paxil is the first drug approved by the FDA specifically for\ntreating social anxiety disorder. Epidemiological studies have\nfound that acute social anxiety is the third most common\npsychiatric disorder in the United States after depression and\nalcoholism, affecting up to 13 percent of Americans.\n\n   Paxil, from the class of psychiatric drugs called selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors that includes Prozac and Zoloft, must\nbe taken for several weeks before patients see a marked change.\n\n   ``You don't get any effect if you take one now and then,'' said\nDr. Jonathan Cole of McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., a Harvard\npsychiatry professor and pioneer in the field of psychoactive drugs\nwho has worked in the field since 1956.\n\n   While there have been widespread reports of people abusing\nViagra in hopes of enhancing their sexual performance, or taking\nprescription weight-loss drugs intended for the morbidly obese just\nto shed 15 pounds, Cole sees little likelihood of social\nwallflowers abusing Paxil.\n\n   ``They aren't likely to be abused by anyone, because they don't\nwork that way,'' Cole said.\n\n   Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of\nAmerica and a private-practice clinical social worker in\nWashington, said she hopes a publicity blitz planned by Paxil\nmanufacturer SmithKline Beecham will raise awareness of social\nanxiety disorder and lead more people to seek help, which could\ninclude psychotherapy instead of drugs.\n\n   The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs have boomed\ninto a $7 billion-a-year global market, with Paxil second only to\nProzac in sales, but analysts disagree over how large a market\nPaxil might find for treating social anxiety disorder.\n\n   ``Social phobia has been so grossly underdiagnosed and\nundertreated,'' Ross said. She has seen patients who wake up every\nmorning tallying with dread the people they will have to say\n``hello'' to during the day, hate eating lunch with anyone, or who\nwill only go to the supermarket late at night because they want to\nminimize encountering other shoppers.\n\n   ``These people are living in a constant state of nightmare,''\nRoss said. ``All of us from time to time feel shy, and there are\nsituations where it is natural and healthy to feel uncomfortable,\nbut this is a situation where the shyness is so intense and\npervasive that the person makes very negative changes in their life\nto deal with it.''\n\n   Paul K. Ling, a clinical psychologist, said he fears that ``a\ngreat mistake would be a reliance on Paxil alone'' or pressure by\nhealth plans to push Paxil as a cheaper alternative to therapy.\nMany people, he said, can have their social anxiety eased by\nexercises that help them see many of their fears are groundless or\nirrational.\n\n   ``I do feel ambivalent about the approval of this use of Paxil,\nbecause there is the danger that it is just another example of how\nwe are moving toward a pop-a-pill culture,'' Ling said.\n\n   However, Pollack of the MGH said the much greater danger is not\nthat people will try to abuse Paxil, but that people with social\nanxiety disorder will not seek help ``when they have something that\nis treatable, and they can do better and function better in life.''\n","Headline":"\nLITTLE RISK OF ABUSE SEEN FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY MEDICATION \n","Text":["\n   A condition called ``social anxiety disorder'' this week joined\nthe long list of downers in life _ including obesity, impotence,\nand depression _ that Americans once commonly saw as challenges of\nwillpower and character but can now have treated by popping a pill.\n","\n   The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Paxil, a\npopular treatment for depression and panic or obsessive-compulsive\ndisorders, for treating what is sometimes called social phobia may\nconjure up images of a pill that will calm your jitters before\nspeaking in public or meeting strangers at a cocktail party.\n","\n   But area specialists stressed Thursday that the pill will work\nonly for treating the kind of acute, irrational shyness that\ndevastates people's careers and social lives.
