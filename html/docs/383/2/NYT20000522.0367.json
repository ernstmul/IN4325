ALTMAN  \n\n \n(ATTN: Minn., Mass., La., Canada, Britain)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW ORLEANS _ Relatively small amounts of antidepressant drugs\nquickly eased the frequency and severity of hot flashes in some\nwomen with breast cancer, a researcher said Monday at the meeting\nof the American Society of Clinical Oncology here.\n\n   Breast cancer patients often complain of debilitating hot\nflashes from early menopause induced by chemotherapy.\n\n   The apparent new use for antidepressants presumably will also\nbenefit women suffering hot flashes during menopause and men who\nsuffer hot flashes during hormonal therapy for prostate cancer,\nsaid the researcher, Dr. Charles L. Loprinzi of the Mayo Clinic in\nRochester, Minn.\n\n   Although hormones known as estrogens and progesterones can\nrelieve hot flashes, many doctors shy away from prescribing them\nfor women with breast cancer because of concerns that hormones may\nstimulate the growth of malignant tumors.\n\n   Hot flashes can come as night sweats, be part of mood swings and\ndisrupt sleep and work.\n\n   There are now three studies that show the benefit of\nantidepressants on hot flashes.\n\n   Because the antidepressant drugs ``so clearly work and are\nreasonably tolerated,'' they may offer an effective alternative for\nwomen who do not want to take hormones, Loprinzi said at the\nmeeting. However, Loprinzi said that the antidepressants do not\ncompletely relieve hot flashes in every woman.\n\n   The drugs were effective in smaller amounts than are used in\ntreating depression, said Loprinzi, who has conducted two of the\nstudies. They involved two common antidepressants, Prozac and\nEffexor, that are SSRI's, or selective serotonin-reuptake\ninhibitors.\n\n   In March, researchers from Georgetown University reported a\nsimilar benefit in a third study among 27 women using Paxil, also\nan SSRI. said Loprinzi. In the pilot study from Georgetown in\nWashington, the women kept diaries of the frequency and severity of\nhot flashes while they took increasing amounts of Paxil for six\nweeks. The women also completed questionnaires. All women knew they\nwere taking Paxil.\n\n   The two studies with Prozac and Effexor were scientifically more\nrigorous because neither the women nor the doctors knew what drug\nthe women were taking, Loprinzi said.\n\n   The idea for this new use of antidepressants came from anecdotal\nobservations among women who reported unexpected improvement in\ntheir hot flashes while they were taking the drugs to fight\ndepression.\n\n   The study reported Monday was the largest of the three,\ninvolving 229 women who were divided into four groups, Loprinzi\nsaid. The federally funded study began when all women kept a diary\nof their hot flashes for one week.\n\n   Then the women took pills for four weeks. Three groups took\ndifferent doses of Effexor _ either the full dose, 150 milligrams,\nused in treating depression, the half dose, 75 milligrams, or the\nquarter dose, 37.5 milligrams. A fourth group received a placebo,\nor dummy pill.\n\n   The half dose seemed to be the most effective and best tolerated\nin easing hot flashes, Loprinzi said. In this group, Effexor\nreduced hot flashes by 61 percent, compared with the number of hot\nflashes they had before the study began.\n\n   A small number of participants experienced nausea, dry mouth and\na decreased appetite. None reported common side effects associated\nwith use of the antidepressants, such as diminished libido,\ndizziness or nervousness, Loprinzi said.\n\n   Precisely how the drugs ease hot flashes is not known, he said.\n\n   Loprinzi said that researchers elsewhere are conducting a fourth\nstudy involving the antidepressant Zoloft, which has not been\nreported.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   In a separate report, a large Canadian study found that a\nshorter course of radiation following a lumpectomy for early stage\nbreast cancer is as effective as a standard longer regimen. The\nshorter, three-week course of daily radiation gives higher doses.\nThe standard daily five-week course gives lower doses.\n\n   It was the first large rigorous, scientifically controlled study\nof the length of radiation after lumpectomy in women who had no\nevidence of spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes, said Dr.\nTimothy Whelan of the Hamilton Regional Cancer Center in Ontario.\n\n   The study reflects debate between Canadian and European doctors,\nwho believe the shorter course is as effective and can save scarce\nhealth resources, and American doctors who favor the longer course.\n\n   The study of 1,234 women in 10 cancer centers in Canada began in\nApril 1993. Half the group received the three-week course of\nradiation, and the other half received the five-week course.\nOverall survival was the same in both groups. The rate of local\ncancer recurrence in the breast was 2.5 percent among women who had\nthe shorter course and 3.3 percent among those with the longer\ncourse.\n\n   In commenting on the Canadian paper, Dr. Jay Harris, a Harvard\nradiation oncologist, said the research was of high quality. But he\nurged caution in changing practices in the United States. He said\nno change should occur until more time had passed to assure that\nlate complications such as heart attacks do not appear after five\nyears and until completion of a separate British study that will\ncontinue longer than the Canadian one.\n\n   But Harris said the findings would be applicable to Britain and\nCanada, where radiation therapy is more restricted because of a\nlack of facilities.\n","Headline":"\nANTIDEPRESSANTS EASE HOT FLASHES, CANCER STUDY SHOWS  \n BY LAWRENCE K.
