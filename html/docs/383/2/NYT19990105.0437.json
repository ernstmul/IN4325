Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ The man accused of pushing a woman to her death in\nfront of a subway train in Manhattan has told investigators that he\ntried to push another woman in front a subway train in Brooklyn\nless than a year ago, but that the woman fought him off, police\nsaid Tuesday.\n\n   The man, Andrew Goldstein, 29, made the claim when he was\nquestioned about the death of Kendra Webdale, 32, who was killed\nSunday evening when she was pushed in front of an N train at the\nstation at 23rd Street and Broadway, according to three police\nofficials, who spoke in separate interviews on the condition of\nanonymity.\n\n   The officials said they were not sure whether to believe\nGoldstein's account of the Brooklyn attack, given his history of\nmental illness, but added that police would seek evidence in an\neffort to corroborate his story.\n\n   ``He may not be the best source for this,'' one of the officials\nsaid.\n\n   But another police official said that most of Goldstein's\nstatements to police had been borne out so far. ``Basically,\neverything he's told us has been on the money,'' the official said.\n\n   Goldstein, who has been charged with second-degree murder in the\ndeath of Ms. Webdale, has spent the last decade in and out of\nstate, city and private hospitals, as well as halfway houses and\noutpatient clinics, for treatment of mental illness, law\nenforcement and health officials said. After he was arrested Sunday\nnight, police said, he confessed to pushing Ms. Webdale to her\ndeath, and then spoke of trying to push a woman off a subway\nplatform in Brooklyn in May. The officials said that Goldstein\nclaimed he was thwarted when the woman resisted furiously and\npunched him in the face.\n\n   Goldstein, the officials said, told the detectives that police\nofficers who were summoned to the station took him to a hospital\npsychiatric ward instead of arresting him. That would be consistent\nwith normal procedure, according to the Police Department's Patrol\nGuide.\n\n   Goldstein went on to say that he was freed a couple of days\nlater when he was released from the ward, the officials said. Under\nstate law, people must be proved both mentally ill and a danger to\nthemselves or others to justify an involuntary commitment for\nshort-term hospitalizations or longer stays in an institution.\n\n   Police officials said that Goldstein told detectives that he\nuses two kinds of medication, Haldol and Congentin, for his mental\nillness. Officials would not comment on the specifics of\nGoldstein's illness, but the two drugs are often used to treat\nparanoid schizophrenia.\n\n   The officials said it was unclear whether he had been taking the\nmedicine recently.\n\n   John Olson, 20, who shared a basement apartment with Goldstein\nin Howard Beach, Queens, said Monday that Goldstein was apparently\nestranged from his parents, and that his father lived in Delaware\nand his mother lived in New York. He said that Goldstein had\ncomplained recently of quarreling with his mother over money.\n\n   Goldstein's landlady, Sarita Gonzalez, said Tuesday that\nGoldstein's father sent him $50 each month.\n\n   Police would not say Tuesday whether they had managed to find\nGoldstein's parents.\n\n   Goldstein's current status as a murder suspect stands in sad\ncontrast to his youth.
