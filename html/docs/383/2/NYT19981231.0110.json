The mentally ill, at least in theory, would be aided by any\nknowledge gained about the biology of psychosis.\n\n   Most of the ketamine experiments have been conducted at the\nNational Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., or at\nNIMH-funded facilities such as the medical schools of Yale and New\nYork University.\n\n   A Globe review of their research and some of the consent forms\nthat participants are asked to sign indicates that subjects are\noften not being told that the drug is being given to specifically\ninduce symptoms such as hallucinations or memory loss, or that it\nis abused as a psychedelic drug.\n\n   On the streets and on drug-subculture Internet sites, ketamine\nis known for being able to create near-death experiences, feelings\nof floating, and other hallucinations. It has recently been used as\na date-rape drug and at all-night parties known as ``raves,''\nprompting several states to make illegal possession a felony.\n\n   Some critics see these experiments as an echo of 1950s and 1960s\nresearch in which psychiatrists gave people LSD without fully\ninforming them of the risk.\n\n   ``It's just like shades of LSD research as far as I'm\nconcerned,'' said Carl Tishler, an Ohio State University\npsychologist who has written on the ethics of ketamine experiments.\n\n   LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, was made illegal across the\nnation in the 1960s.\n\n   Ketamine is primarily used as an animal tranquilizer,\nparticularly for cats and nonhuman primates. It had once been\ncommonly used as a human anesthetic, until its hallucinogenic\nproperties were discovered. Ketamine, also known on the streets as\n``KitKat'' or, simply, ``K,'' is a chemical cousin of PCP, or\n``angel dust.''\n\n   In a series on psychiatric research last month, the Globe\ndocumented the harm done by the use of ketamine and other\n``challenge'' agents to induce psychotic symptoms in people with\nschizophrenia, as well as from other research approaches. An\nadditional review has revealed studies involving ketamine in more\nthan 100 healthy people since 1994 _ and the growing illicit use of\nthe drug. Such studies do not appear to have been done in\nMassachusetts, although a bill has been filed by a private citizen\nto strengthen research protections here.\n\n   ``If this is what they are doing to normal (people), God help us\nwith the cognitively impaired,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of\nMaryland bioethicist and editor of the journal Accountability in\nResearch.\n\n   As a result of the Globe's review, Shamoo said the New\nYork-based advocacy group he co-founded with Vera Hassner Sharav,\nCitizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research, will\nexpand its call for a moratorium on challenge studies, to include\nthose involving healthy people.\n\n   Among some of the results of ketamine in healthy subjects\nreported in the literature: Feelings of floating and of having a\ntransistor radio implanted in the ear; acute psychotic states;\n``psychedelic effects''; ``tearfulness, a sad mood''; and feelings\nof ``life and death at the same time.''\n\n   While the possibility of experiencing long-term harm from a\ndrug-induced psychosis is less likely among healthy people, there\nis still the risk that some normal subjects will have flashbacks\nmonths afterward, even if they apparently have no history of\nsubstance abuse or mental illness that would make them vulnerable,\naccording to the Globe's review of LSD and ketamine research, and\nethicists familiar with the research.\n\n   There is also a possibility that healthy subjects would refuse\nto disclose elements of their medical history to researchers for\nfear it would mean they would be unable to participate. (Some of\nthe ketamine studies paid $100 per subject.)\n\n   ``That is something to worry about,'' said Jonathan Moreno,\ndirector of the University of Virginia's Center for Biomedical\nEthics and a specialist on the history of LSD research.\n\n   A top NIMH official and a Yale psychiatrist who has conducted\nsome of the studies said they do not believe that ketamine's illict\nuse needs to be spelled out in informed consent forms, since the\ndrug is still approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an\nanesthetic. Above all, the careful use of ketamine in research may\nhelp yield answers for some of the most devastating mental\nillnesses, they say.\n\n   ``This is a medicine which is given under close scrutiny for a\nshort-term basis. There is no repeat long-term exposure,'' said Dr.\nTrey Sunderland, chairman of NIMH's institutional review board,\nwhich has approved ketamine studies involving both healthy subjects\nand those with schizophrenia. As a result, ketamine's street use is\n``not an issue in these studies'' and not brought up with subjects.\n\n   ``I don't think there's a direct comparison between the ketamine\nresearch and the LSD research,'' Sunderland said, since ketamine is\nFDA-approved and shorter acting. In addition, ``I know of no such\nlong-term effects with this kind of study,'' like flashbacks,\nalthough he said it is not a matter of routine for researchers to\ncheck up with subjects months later.\n\n   Dr. John H. Krystal, a Yale professor of psychiatry who has\nconducted studies in both healthy people and people with mental\nillness, said that his group began using ketamine ``based on a\nreading of the old PCP literature. There might be symptoms or\ncognitive deficits or emotional problems associated with\nschizophrenia that might be modeled by ketamine.''\n\n   ``The hope . . . is that we might gain new insights into\ntreatment of these symptoms,'' Krystal said. Ketamine is thought to\nprovide a better model of schizophrenia than LSD or other\npsychostimulants, because it appears to induce both hallucinations\nand bizarre thoughts, or so-called positive symptoms, as well as\nthe social withdrawal and other negative symptoms of the disease.\n\n   Krystal said he is certain that during his early studies, first\npublished in 1994, subjects were not told of ketamine's use as a\nstreet drug, but he did not have available the most recent consent\nforms to verify what subjects are now told.\n\n   However, he said, ``People who participate are made aware that\nit has effects on mood that may make some people want to use it.''\n\n   But James Childress, a member of the National Bioethics Advisory\nCommission, which is calling for special research protections for\nthe mentally ill, said the illicit use of ketamine is ``exactly the\nsort of thing that should be disclosed'' to study participants.\n\n   Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania,\nsaid such disclosure is particularly important because ``There's\nalways the danger of hooking someone, getting someone down a road\nthey don't even want to travel.''\n\n   One legislator in Florida, a state that has considered making\npossession of ketamine a felony, agreed.\n\n   ``If government is going to do studies on people, I think they\nneed to tell people what they're ingesting. It seems government\nshould have learned that lesson a long time ago,'' said Florida\nstate Representative Tracy Stafford, a Democrat who has filed a\nbill to make ketamine a controlled substance.\n\n   Some ethicists who reviewed an NIMH consent form obtained by the\nGlobe said they were most worried about its failure to fully\nexplain the effects of ketamine.\n\n   ``If in fact the purpose of the NIMH study was to produce a\npsychotic state, or if they knew it would produce a psychotic\nstate, then they should tell their subjects that,'' said Leonard\nGlantz, a medical ethicist and professor of health law at Boston\nUniversity School of Public Health. ``It's not a side effect or a\nhazard. It's a desired outcome.''\n\n   NIMH's Sunderland defended the form. ``It does mention you might\nget an altered mood, hallucinations. . .
