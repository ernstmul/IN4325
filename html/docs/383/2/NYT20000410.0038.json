(The Week in Review)  \n By ERICA GOODE   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful\ndrugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies\ninto the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go\nto bed on time?\n\n   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented\nan acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _\nprimarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a\nfive-year period would suggest just that.\n\n   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as\nthe latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and\ndisorders. And politicians have seized the opportunity to condemn\nthe ``overmedicating'' of the nation's youngest citizens. On March\n20, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced a major federal initiative to\nreverse the trend.\n\n   Yet, as often happens when science goes to Washington, the\ncomplexities that underlie the study's findings have been slighted\nin the public debate.\n\n   And while concern over the rise in prescriptions is warranted,\noutrage may be premature. In fact, scientists know almost nothing\nabout the children who are receiving such drugs, or the\ncircumstances under which the medications are being prescribed. The\nstudy in question, for example, published in the Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association, did not analyze information about the\nchildren's diagnoses or the specialties of the physicians who wrote\nthe prescriptions.\n\n   What little researchers and clinicians do know suggests that the\nincreases cannot be solely attributed to reckless prescribing by\ndoctors hell-bent on tagging a psychiatric label on every child who\nwalks into the consulting room.\n\n   While pressure on parents and the current popularity of\ndiagnoses like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and\ndepression undoubtedly play a role, it is also clear that at least\nsome proportion of very young children taking psychiatric drugs\nhave severe troubles. And in many cases, the drugs are given as a\nlast resort, prescribed in the hope of protecting the child's\nsafety, ensuring the safety of others or offering relief to a\ntoddler whose life is being swallowed up by symptoms.\n\n   ``I think the general public doesn't understand that we're not\ntalking about kids who won't stay in the grocery cart,'' said Dr.\nMarsha D. Rappley, an associate professor in pediatrics and human\nmedicine at Michigan State University and the lead investigator in\na smaller 15-month study of medication use in preschoolers with\nattention disorders.\n\n   ``We are talking about very disturbed behavior,'' Rappley said.\n``And these children need help.''\n\n   Rappley's study, which tracked 223 children under the age of 3\nwho were enrolled in a Michigan Medicaid program, has been cited in\nthe public debate as one more indication that very young children\nare being drugged unnecessarily. Yet a closer look at the study,\none of the few to offer clues to who these young pill takers are,\ndoes not entirely bear out that view.\n\n   True, Rappley and her colleagues found that 57 percent of the\nchildren were given psychiatric medications. And of that group,\n45.7 percent were prescribed more than one drug. In all, 30\ncombinations of 22 psychiatric medications were observed.\n\n   But the researchers also found that almost half the preschoolers\nin the study suffered from diabetes, asthma or other major chronic\nillnesses in addition to the attention disorder. Almost half had\nother psychiatric problems, including developmental or language\ndelays, emotional disturbance and autism. Five percent were victims\nof child abuse or other traumas. And 40 percent were treated for an\ninjury during the study period, 12 percent on more than one\noccasion.\n\n   ``This cannot really be dismissed as bad behavior on the part of\ndoctors who want to medicate children,'' Dr. Rappley said. ``It is\nnot that simple.''\n\n   Dr. Peter S. Jensen, director of the Center for the Advancement\nof Children's Mental Health at the New York State Psychiatric\nInstitute, said the level of severity found in the Michigan study\nmeshed with his own experience.\n\n   ``Most parents are terribly frightened and loath to put a child\non medication, and it's the kind of thing they would do when\neverything else has been tried,'' said Jensen, who added that\nmedication is usually combined with behavior therapy or parenting\nadvice. In one case he recalled, a 3-year-old showed an escalating\npattern of severe aggression, eventually wounding another child in\nhis day-care center with a butter knife.\n\n   ``We know that 6 to 9 percent of older kids have severe\nemotional disturbances,'' Jensen said. ``Do we think it happens out\nof the brow of Zeus? Where were these kids at the age of 3 or 4 or\n5? To my mind, the crime is not that these children are being put\non medicine, but that we don't have the data to know what we are\ndoing.''\n\n   Indeed, scientists' ignorance is at the core of the problem.\nInvestigators have no idea, for example, how prevalent severe\nmental disorders are among the very young, what the best ways to\ntreat such illnesses might be or which children are most\nvulnerable.\n\n     \n   \n   BC-R-KIDS-PSYCHODRUGS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT      \n   UNDATED: most vulnerable.     \n\n   And even when doctors prescribe medication in a last-ditch\nattempt to help a very disturbed child, they are operating in a\ndata vacuum: little or nothing is known about the effects of\npsychiatric drugs on the developing brain or the long-term impact\non social relations, academic achievement or personality in young\nchildren who take such drugs. And most of the medications have not\nbeen specifically tested or had their dosages calibrated for young\nchildren.\n\n   As Dr. Julie Magno Zito, an associate professor of pharmacy and\nmedicine at the University of Maryland and the lead author of the\nrecent journal study, commented when asked about the prescription\nincreases: ``We don't have any benchmarks to know if this is or is\nnot a problem.''\n\n   In addition, the line between normality and clinical illness in\na 3-year-old is rarely clearly defined. Dr. Alison Gopnik, a\ndevelopmental psychologist at the University of California at\nBerkeley, said many aspects of behavior _ like impulse control, the\nability to focus and empathy _ vary greatly from child to child,\nand develop at different ages.\n\n   Gopnik said she was disturbed by ``the idea of doing this in\npreschoolers, where the medical evidence isn't there.''\n\n   ``I don't think parents always have a good idea of what just\nnormal preschooler behavior is,'' she added.\n\n   Increasingly, Gopnik said, there is a ``mismatch between what\nchildren are like just as children, what schools require from\nchildren and the time and energy parents have to negotiate that\ndifference.''\n\n   Psychiatrists still know little, if anything, about diagnosing\nspecific mental disorders in preschoolers. Studies indicate that\nsuch diagnoses are often fluid, changing as the child grows older,\nthough severe behavior problems often persist.\n\n   Given the lack of hard data, few experts would dispute that the\nsharp increase in prescriptions for toddlers is disturbing,\nparticularly over so brief a period. Nor would most deny that the\ntrend raises larger social and ethical questions. Zito, for\nexample, said that at some point, society must decide how far down\nthe age scale the medical model, which relies on diagnoses of\nillness and is likely to see drugs as the appropriate treatment,\nshould be extended. ``We are generalizing from adults to school-age\nchildren, and now from school-age children to very young\nchildren.''\n\n   Jensen, a former associate director for child and adolescent\nresearch at the National Institute of Mental Health, said the\nfederal government shares much of the blame for the dearth of\nknowledge about how to evaluate the use of drugs. Federal agencies,\nhe said, have not yet provided high levels of research funding to\nstudy children's mental health.\n\n   That may be changing. Responding to the outcry over Zito's\nstudy, the National Institute of Mental Health said it would spend\n$6 million over the next five years to study whether Ritalin is\nsafe and effective for children under 6. And the White House is\nplanning a conference next fall on mental illness in preschoolers.\n\n   Eventually, scientists may learn whether the increase in drug\nprescriptions charted by Zito and her colleagues represent\novermedication or appropriate _ in some cases, lifesaving _\ntreatment for young children.\n\n   Outrage is easy; it is harder, and more expensive, to find real\nanswers.\n","Headline":"\nREADING, WRITING AND RITALIN: FURY, NOT FACTS, OVER CHILD\nBEHAVIOR \n","Text":["\n   Are toddlers being plied with Prozac, Ritalin and other powerful\ndrugs for behavior problems no more severe than sticking pennies\ninto the VCR, throwing peas at the dinner table or refusing to go\nto bed on time?\n","\n   The hand-wringing in recent weeks over a study that documented\nan acute increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications _\nprimarily stimulants and antidepressants _ for preschoolers over a\nfive-year period would suggest just that.\n","\n   Some mental health professionals have painted young children as\nthe latest victims of a culture obsessed with syndromes and\ndisorders.
