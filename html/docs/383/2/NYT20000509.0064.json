(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By LEAH R. GARNETT  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Just as the 14-year patent on Prozac is about to expire and the\ndrug's maker, Eli Lilly and Co., is preparing to launch a new\nversion, a body of evidence has come to light revealing the\nantidepressant's dark side.\n\n   The company's internal documents, some dating to the mid-1980s,\nas well as government applications and patents, indicate that the\npharmaceutical giant has known for years that its best-selling drug\ncould cause suicidal reactions in a small but significant number of\npatients. The reports could become critical as Lilly seeks\ngovernment approval for its new Prozac.\n\n   Among the findings:\n\n   --Internal documents show that in 1990, Lilly scientists were\npressured by corporate executives to alter records on physician\nexperiences with Prozac, changing mentions of suicide attempt to\n``overdose'' and suicidal thoughts to ``depression.''\n\n   --Three years before Prozac received approval by the US Food and\nDrug Administration in late 1987, the German BGA, that country's\nFDA equivalent, had such serious reservations about Prozac's safety\nthat it refused to approve the antidepressant based on Lilly's\nstudies showing that previously nonsuicidal patients who took the\ndrug had a fivefold higher rate of suicides and suicide attempts\nthan those on older antidepressants, and a threefold higher rate\nthan those taking placebos.\n\n   --Lilly's own figures, in reports made available to the Globe,\nindicate that 1 in 100 previously nonsuicidal patients who took the\ndrug in early clinical trials developed a severe form of anxiety\nand agitation called akathisia, causing them to attempt or commit\nsuicide during the studies.\n\n   --Though Lilly has steadfastly defended the drug's safety and\ndownplayed studies linking Prozac to suicide, the patent for the\nnew Prozac, R-fluoxetine, expected to be marketed by Lilly\nbeginning in 2002, notes that the new version will not produce\nseveral existing side effects including ``akathisia, suicidal\nthoughts, and self-mutilation,'' which the patent calls ``one of\nits more significant side effects.''\n\n   --A McLean Hospital researcher and associate professor at\nHarvard Medical School, Dr. Martin Teicher, whose early 1990s\nstudies linked Prozac to akathisia and suicide, is a co-inventor of\nthe new Prozac, which Lilly plans to market, along with Timothy J.\nBarberich, the CEO of Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug\ncompany, and James W. Young.\n\n   --A just-published book, ``Prozac Backlash,'' by a Cambridge\npsychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, has drawn Lilly's ire for\ndiscussing Prozac's link to suicide, tics, withdrawal symptoms, and\nother side effects of Prozac and similar antidepressants.\n\n   Lilly officials continue to defend the drug's effectiveness,\nsaying its track record is borne out by the fact it is still the\nmost widely prescribed drug of its kind. In a written statement,\nJeff Newton, a Lilly spokesman, said: ``There is no credible\nevidence that establishes a causal link between Prozac and violent\nor suicidal behavior. There is, to the contrary, scientific\nevidence showing that Prozac and medicines like it actually protect\nagainst such behaviors.''\n\n   Using figures on Prozac both from Lilly and independent\nresearch, however, Dr. David Healy, an expert on the brain's\nserotonin system and director of the North Wales Department of\nPsychological Medicine at the University of Wales, estimated that\n``probably 50,000 people have committed suicide on Prozac since its\nlaunch, over and above the number who would have done so if left\nuntreated.''\n\n   Healy, meanwhile, is conducting a new study that he says is the\nfirst of its kind, giving antidepressants to healthy people to\nstudy possible links to suicide. The results are expected to be\npublished in June.\n\n   Prozac's success is certainly unquestioned. The introduction of\nthe drug to the US market in the late 1980s changed the way\nAmericans viewed their most intimate emotions and limitations.\nBilled as a wonder drug to combat depression by boosting levels of\nthe brain chemical serotonin, Prozac and others like it were also\nsaid to remedy a host of human frailties from poor self-esteem and\nconcentration to fear of rejection.\n\n   By the end of last year, more than 35 million people worldwide\nwere using the drug, which provided Lilly with more than 25 percent\nof its $10 billion in 1999 revenue.\n\n   Yet the problems with Prozac were known even before it was\nintroduced to the US market. Figures in a 1984 Lilly document\nindicated that akathisia, the severe agitation that can lead to\nsuicide, occurs in at least 1 percent of patients, a level\nconsidered a ``frequent'' event, and as such must be disclosed in a\ncompany's product literature and package inserts. But there is no\nsuch disclosure in Prozac's US literature, and it is not clear\nwhether the FDA panel charged with approving Prozac simply\noverlooked or did not have access to certain critical data of\nLilly's.\n\n   As a result, researchers say that most US doctors do not know to\nwarn patients of the potentially dangerous effect which, according\nto published literature on the topic, can be alleviated with\nsedatives or by going off the drug.\n\n   German regulators, who eventually approved Prozac for use in\nthat country, require a warning label about the risk of suicide and\nsuggest the concurrent use of sedatives when necessary.\n\n   Akathisia is listed in Lilly's US product literature, but as an\ninfrequent event in Prozac users. No mention is made of its\npotential relationship to suicide.\n\n   A relationship, however, was found in a Globe search of US\npatents. The patent for the new Prozac or R-fluoxetine (US Patent\nno. 5,708,035), which Lilly will market after the existing patent\nexpires in 2001, contains a wealth of information about the\noriginal Prozac. According to the patent, the new Prozac will\ndecrease side effects of the existing Prozac such as headaches,\nnervousness, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as ``inner restlessness\n(akathisia), suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation'' _ the same\neffect Lilly has contended has not occurred in any substantial way\nin some 200 lawsuits against it over the past decade. Most of the\nsuits were settled out of court and the terms kept confidential.\n\n     \n   \nA 1990 communique\n\n     \n  \n\n   In an electronic communique obtained by author Glenmullen dated\nNov. 13, 1990, from Claude Bouchy, a Lilly employee in Germany, to\nthree Lilly corporate executives at the company's Indianapolis\nheadquarters, Bouchy says he and a colleague ``have problems with\nthe directions our safety people are getting from the corporate\ngroup (Drug Epidemiology Unit) and requesting that we change the\nidentification of events as they are reported by the physicians. .\n. . Our safety staff is requested to change the event term `suicide\nattempt' (as reported by the physician) to `overdose.' ''\n\n   Bouchy continued that ``. . . it is requested that we change . .\n. `suicidal ideation' to `depression.' ''\n\n   And then Bouchy makes an appeal to his US Lilly colleagues: ``I\ndo not think I could explain to the BGA, to a judge, to a reporter\nor even to my family why we would do this especially on the\nsensitive issue of suicide and suicide ideation.
