MORROW    \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Executives of Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the pharmaceutical giant, said\nthey were delighted to learn earlier this month that an independent\nstudy had found that one of their drugs was more effective for\npeople trying to quit smoking than the nicotine patch.\n\n   The study crowned a remarkably successful second career for the\ndrug, sustained-release bupropion, which is sold for smoking\ncessation as Zyban. The drug was introduced in 1997 as an\nantidepressant, extended-release Wellbutrin.\n\n   Later that year, the virtually identical drug _ even the same\ngrape color       _ was rolled out as Zyban. As Wellbutrin, the drug\nhad $506 million in sales in the United States last year, while as\nZyban, it had another $151 million in sales.\n\n   The chance for such lucrative second and third uses is driving\nnearly every big pharmaceutical company to try to expand a drug\nbrand. While the trend is not new, there has been a recent upsurge\nin such activity as drug companies labor to maintain their strong\nearnings growth in the face of rising costs for research and\ndevelopment.\n\n   New, approved uses for drugs _ what the industry calls\nindications _ have also increased since the Food and Drug\nAdministration relaxed its policy last year on distributing\ninformation about an existing drug's likely uses.\n\n   ``Drug companies are definitely searching for additional\nindications more now than in the past,'' said Ian Sanderson, a\nmanaging director at SG Cowen Securities. ``The Food and Drug\nAdministration is encouraging drug companies to conduct studies for\nthe development of new indications. But generating new indications\nhas become a way for the drug companies to rescue a flagging\nfranchise.''\n\n   The Monsanto Co. rolled out Celebrex, a pain killer for\narthritis, in January and immediately announced that the drug was\nbeing tested to treat Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer. The\nAmerican Home Products Corp. has put Premarin, the world's leading\nestrogen replacement therapy, back in the lab as a potential\ntreatment for Alzheimer's.\n\n   Even the granddaddy of them all _ Prozac _ may find yet another\nway to make the world's population happier. Eli Lilly & Co.      has\nfiled an application with the FDA to have the popular\nantidepressant approved to treat severe premenstrual syndrome.\n\n   All are trying to find ways to increase revenues with minimal\nexpense for research and development. By creating a second brand,\nthey can do both with very little risk.\n\n   For one, pharmaceutical companies do not have to replicate the\nresearch done before there can be clinical trials on people. That\ncan cut years and some $20 million to $40 million from the\ndevelopment process. This reduced research and development budget\nmeans that second brands can have profit margins of around 85\npercent, on average, compared with 80 percent for original\ncompounds.\n\n   While drug research is extremely complex, doctors say that many\ncompounds are capable of treating more than one illness. Once a\ndrug shows some effectiveness within one of the body's complex\nnetworks _ the central nervous system, for example _ it is often\nable to treat several illnesses common to that area of the body.\n\n   That explains why so many drugs originally used to treat\ndepression have later been approved by the FDA to treat anxiety and\npanic disorder. Doctors also note that compounds used in\naccelerated doses can also have different effects on the body.\nIbuprofen is sold over-the-counter as Advil, a common painkiller.\nBut at greatly increased doses, the drug is one of the leading\nprescription treatments for arthritic swelling.\n\n   Drug companies need FDA approval before such alternate uses can\nbe cited on a drug's label. But the agency no longer frowns heavily\nupon pharmaceutical companies' promoting their medications for\nother uses without formal FDA approval.\n\n   Drug companies can now give doctors information that has\nappeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal or text book about an\napproved medication's additional uses, allowing manufacturers to\nestablish new markets for existing medications much more quickly.\n\n   The financial downsides are few. Since existing drugs have\nalready passed the FDA's scrutiny, they are less likely to fail\nclinical trials for new uses. Should the drug fail those trials,\nthe drug company loses some $250 million, analysts estimate, a\nhealthy sum but quite a bit less than the $500 million required to\ndevelop original compounds.\n\n   And the financial losses from drug expansions should fall\nsharply as scientists become more sophisticated in their research\ntechniques. Scientists now expect to find additional uses of drugs\nunder development, while in the past, it was largely a case of\nbeing pleasantly surprised.\n\n   Pfizer      Inc. had originally developed sildenafil citrate, best\nknown as Viagra, in the early 1990s to treat angina. The treatment\nultimately failed, but Pfizer scientists were encouraged from the\nclinical trials when several men reported an odd side effect:\nerections.\n\n   Sildenafil citrate was then developed successfully for male\nerectile dysfunction, what turned out to be an enormous market.\nViagra racked up $788 million in worldwide sales last year after\nbeing on the market for only nine months.\n\n   ``In the past, new indications for drugs were primarily based on\ngood side effects that were uncovered in the clinical trials,''\nsaid Carrie S. Cox, senior vice president for global business\nmanagement for Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. ``But now we understand so\nmuch more about how a drug affects the body so much earlier in the\nresearch process. We can more effectively maximize a product's\nopportunity.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   American Home Products, for example, has conducted more than\n3,000 scientific studies on Premarin, an estrogen replacement\ntablet, which has been on the market for 56 years. Most of the\nPremarin studies have involved women's health, which have produced\na bounty of possible new uses. One study revealed that Premarin\nhelps stop tooth loss in women, a symptom of osteoporosis.\n\n   ``Premarin has been out for such a long time that we have a vast\nknowledge about the drug,'' said Dr. Philip de Vane, vice president\nof clinical affairs at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of\nAmerican Home Products. ``With tooth loss, people have realized\nthat the jaw is like the spine or hips. Women can protect their\nteeth as they protect other parts of their bodies.''\n\n   In developing new uses for drugs, scientists have also become\nmore thorough. When Monsanto was developing Celebrex, the company's\nexecutives searched reports on diseases for any hint of medical\neffects drugs like Celebrex could produce. One study by the state\nof Tennessee found that these drugs could greatly reduce the\nincidence of colon cancer, while another by Johns Hopkins\nUniversity suggested these medications slowed the progressions of\nAlzheimer's.\n\n   ``These kinds of studies show us what the trends are,'' said Dr.\nPhilip Needleman, the co-president of G.D. Searle, Monsanto's\npharmaceutical division. ``It provides us with the basis of doing a\nclinical trial.''\n\n   While expanding a drug's uses should increase its sales, the new\nbrand can deliver a few other dividends. When an existing drug\nreceives FDA approval for a new use, the pharmaceutical company\nsometimes receives an extension on the patent _ which now lasts 20\nyears _ but only in narrow circumstances.\n\n   By developing a new use for finasteride, Merck & Co.'s drug for\ntreating enlarged prostates, the company received another patent on\nthe compound. Finasteride was reintroduced in 1998, in a different\ndosage, as Propecia, a pill for male pattern baldness. The patent\non the five-milligram formulation of finasteride for the prostate\nbrand, Proscar, expires in 2006, but the one-milligram formulation\nfor Propecia is protected until 2013.\n\n   In theory, the extension should enable Merck to protect its\nentire finasteride franchise from generics, but that does not\nalways work. De Vane noted that even with an extension on the new\ndosage, the patent on the original compound will still expire and\ninvite generic competition.\n\n   Second brands can also cause other troubles. There is no\nguarantee the new brands will be a success, and, on rare occasion,\ncan become more trouble than they are worth. Take Propecia, a pill\nthat many analysts believed would rack up as much as $300 million\nin sales its first year. Sales last year totaled a modest $83\nmillion worldwide, despite Merck spending some $91 million for\nadvertisements promoting the drug to consumers, according to\nCompetitive Media Reporting.\n\n   Yet, meager sales were far from Propecia's only problem. When\nPropecia was introduced, Merck executives insisted the drug did not\nshare Proscar's research budget but instead ran up its own bill,\nestimated by analysts at some $450 million. At Propecia's current\nsales pace, it will take a little more than five years just to\nrecoup the research money, without even starting to recover its\nadvertising expenses.\n\n   A spokeswoman for Merck said the company was pleased with\nPropecia's performance, noting that more than 400,000 men in the\nUnited States were using it after it was on the market for only one\nyear.\n\n   Second brands can also sometimes confuse or even irritate some\nconsumers. Glaxo Wellcome did not go out of its way to tell\nconsumers that Zyban was actually sustained-release Wellbutrin.\nWhile the two drugs cost the same _ about $1.16 a pill wholesale _\nsome 77 percent of Wellbutrin's prescriptions are covered by\ninsurers, compared with only 47.6 percent for Zyban, according to\nthe industry consultant IMS Health.\n\n   Propecia users have been even less fortunate. Merck sold\nPropecia for three times the price, per milligram, than what it\ncharged for Proscar. Since one Proscar tablet equals five daily\ndoses of Propecia, many men began splitting the pills into five\nparts to save money. Analysts believe Propecia's lofty price may\nhave contributed to the drug's sluggish start, given that men must\ntake it for three months to see results.\n\n   Analysts say that drug companies sometimes increase the price of\na drug that is used for a second indication to cover additional\nexpenses. Not only will the drug company have to recoup its costs\nfor consumer ads, the company may have expanded its sales force to\nreach a new market.\n\n   Even with these setbacks, drug companies are determined to keep\nintroducing second brands. Some executives even regard these new\nindications not as marketing tools, but as significant advances in\nscience. And some appear to be.\n\n   ``When we first began studying Wellbutrin, we had all these\nreports from people saying the drug helped them quit smoking,''\nsaid Andrew Johnston, who heads psychiatric clinical development at\nGlaxo Wellcome. ``At first we had only anecdotal evidence that it\nworked. But we managed to confirm all that. Now we have shown that\nyou can treat nicotine addiction without using nicotine.''  \n","Headline":"\nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SEEKING NEW USES FOR DRUGS \n","Text":["\n   Executives of Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the pharmaceutical giant, said\nthey were delighted to learn earlier this month that an independent\nstudy had found that one of their drugs was more effective for\npeople trying to quit smoking than the nicotine patch.\n","\n   The study crowned a remarkably successful second career for the\ndrug, sustained-release bupropion, which is sold for smoking\ncessation as Zyban.
