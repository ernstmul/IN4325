Times News Service   \n\n   Patients across the country are facing steep increases in\nout-of-pocket charges for prescription drugs, reversing a recent\ntrend toward more liberal coverage.\n\n   Standard co-payments are often doubling for drugs that patients\nhave been using for years. But even bigger increases _ of 300\npercent or more _ are appearing for some remedies that are not on\ninsurers' lists of approved drugs.\n\n   Drugs may be omitted, or dropped, from such lists because they\nare deemed nonessential, like those for male impotence, baldness or\nwrinkles, or to help people quit smoking. But in many cases,\ninsurers are refusing to endorse more costly new versions of\nlife-sustaining drugs when cheaper alternatives are available.\n\n   This double-barreled increase means that if patients insist on a\ncertain drug, they might see the cost skyrocket from, say, $10 to\n$50.\n\n   But will patients always do better with the latest, most costly\ndrug, or is a flood of advertising making them think they will?\nConversely, is a generic version of a drug, or a cheaper name\nbrand, equally as good just because federal regulators and health\nplans say it is? Those questions are open to debate.\n\n   Drug makers insist that their new drugs are better and have\nfewer harmful side effects. By pushing cheaper, older drugs, they\nsay, health plans ultimately drive up costs for hospital stays,\nnursing homes and doctors.\n\n   Employers and managed-care executives counter that they must\nslow the explosive spending for prescription drugs, which rose 15\nto 20 percent in each of the last two years as an array of costly\nnew drugs hit the market. Demand for those drugs, they say, was fed\nby thousands of promotional visits to doctors, and $1.3 billion in\nconsumer advertising.\n\n   Asking Congress to address the problem, President Clinton said\nin his State of the Union speech last week that ``affordable\nprescription drugs'' should be included in a restructured Medicare\nprogram.\n\n   Many of the debate's ambiguities can be seen in the case of\nJacqueline Lawrence, 70, of San Carlos, Calif. She used to pay a\ntotal of $16 a month for two drugs, for high blood pressure and\nbronchitis. But when she was forced recently to switch her Medicare\nhealth plan to Aetna U.S. Healthcare, she found neither drug on the\nlist. She tried the alternatives, but ``all kinds of side effects''\nforced her back to her original drugs. As a result, her monthly\ncosts tripled to $50.\n\n   ``If a third drug that I take goes up to that extent, I don't\nknow how I will manage,'' Ms. Lawrence said. Her 88-year-old\nmother, Lucille Warren, has faced similar problems. ``My mother\nworries about it,'' she said, ``and that makes her feel worse.''\n\n   While the choice used to be between generics and name brands,\nthere is now a three-tiered system for many drug plans. This month,\nmany of the biggest plans started charging $50 or more for drugs\nnot on their lists. In a letter to members in small businesses,\nOxford Health Plans explained the new system, using blood pressure\ndrugs as an example.\n\n   An Oxford member typically used to pay $5 at the store for\ncaptopril, a generic version of Capoten, an old drug made by\nBristol-Myers Squibb, or $10 for most brand-name drugs. Now, the\ntypical Oxford member's payment for generic Capoten would be $7.\nFor Accupril, made by Warner-Lambert, or Monopril, also made by\nBristol-Myers _ both on the preferred list _ she would pay $15 or\n$20 or the retail price, whichever was less.\n\n   Oxford members who work for large employers now typically pay\n$20 for all brands, although some big companies still subsidize $10\npayments.\n\n   But in small businesses in New York, if the patient went off the\nlist _ for drugs like Merck's Vasotec, or the original Capoten _\nshe would pay $50 or the retail price. That would be $50 for\nCapoten (retail price $94.95 for a month's supply) and $34.99 for\nVasotec, the retail price at the Seventh Avenue Pharmacy in Park\nSlope, Brooklyn. (The pharmacy receives only a flat $1.75 fee,\nregardless of the brand, said Bert Drachtman, the owner.)\n\n   Even small increases hurt. ``To go to $20 from $10 is a big\njump,'' said Max Daniels, community events director of Hospital\nAudiences, a small nonprofit agency in New York that is covered by\nOxford. ``My doctor can't prescribe generics for me.''\n\n   ``Direct advertising by drug companies is feeding consumer\ndemand,'' said David Hom, executive director of corporate benefits\nat Pitney Bowes, which covers 26,000 employees in the United\nStates. ``We could see people shifting from Mevacor to Lipitor,'' a\nheavily promoted new cholesterol-lowering drug.\n\n   Dr. Nicholas Hanchak, head of pharmacy management for Aetna U.S.\nHealthcare, said the drug companies were using advertising and\nthousands of visits to doctors to promote ``higher-cost items.''\nThe newer drugs are often essentially the same as older, cheaper\nones, he said, as determined by federal regulators and the\ncompany's own physician and pharmacist review board.\n\n   ``Newer is not necessarily better, it's just better marketed,''\nsaid Patricia Wilson, a consultant on managed drug-plans based in\nRosemont, Pa.\n\n   Spokesmen for drug makers, which are far more profitable than\nother health care industries, say consumers get valuable\ninformation from the ads, which they can take to doctors. But\nmanaged-care executives say patients often demand advertised drugs\nthat are not appropriate or no more effective than cheaper\nalternatives.\n\n   One factor influencing the lists is that HMOs often make deals\nwith drug makers, negotiating lower prices in return for pushing a\nparticular drug.\n\n   Paul Pochtar, a managed-care marketing director at Novartis\nPharmaceuticals Corp., added that charging employees more ``will\ngive them a greater appreciation for the drug benefit.'' He said,\n``Most people with coverage take the drug benefit for granted.''\n\n   Dr. Lee Newcomer, medical director of Unitedhealth Group, one of\nthe biggest managed-care companies, said United added expensive new\ndrugs to its preferred list if they produced unique benefits.\n\n   Drugs accounted for 12 percent of Pitney Bowes' health costs\nlast year, a big jump from 7.5 percent six years ago. The company\nhas just introduced a new payment schedule: Employees now pay 30\npercent of the retail cost of brands not on the preferred list, 20\npercent for brands on the list, and 10 percent for lower-priced\ngenerics. But there is no charge for drugs at Pitney Bowes' clinics\nin Connecticut, where the company has 6,000 employees.\n\n   Even with the higher costs for patients, industry analysts see\nlittle hope of slowing the increases in 1999. ``It's still going to\nbe double-digit,'' said Mary Sevon, a pharmacy benefit consultant\nbased in Fairless Hills, Pa. ``We saw 18 percent increases last\nyear and we are predicting the same level for this year.''\n\n   She said some health plans are refusing to help pay for any\ndrugs except those on their list in ``categories that cost the most\n_ cardiovascular, nonsteroidal pain-killers for arthritis, and\nantidepressants'' like Prozac. Patients will have to pay the full\ncost, which can be $60 a month or more, for these types of drugs if\nthey are not on the preferred list.\n\n   Health maintenance organizations on the West Coast often offer a\nlist called a closed formulary, said Virginia White, vice president\nof Integrated Pharmaceutical Services, a division of Foundation\nHealth Systems. The HMO typically does not pay for drugs that are\nnot on the list, unless a doctor can persuade the health plan to\nmake an exception when the preferred medication has not worked.\n\n   Kaiser Permanente, for example, recently switched its California\nmembers from Coumadin, a DuPont blood-thinner that protects against\nstroke, to warfarin sodium, a generic the Food and Drug\nAdministration said was biologically equivalent. Dr. David Campen,\na Kaiser pharmaceutical executive, said the change had saved Kaiser\nseveral million dollars in California, where it spends $1 billion a\nyear on drugs.\n\n   Despite the FDA ruling, DuPont persuaded regulators in several\nstates that the generic would cause problems for patients now\ntaking Coumadin, preventing HMOs from making the switch in North\nCarolina, Virginia and Texas.\n\n   Win some, lose some. Regulators in California and New York\noverruled Kaiser when it tried to exclude payments for Viagra,\nPfizer's popular impotence treatment.\n\n   Susan Palomba, manager of health care planning and\nadministration at Timken Co., based in Canton, Ohio, said that\n``some HMOs in some locations are being much more aggressive in\nintroducing closed formularies.'' But Timken still offers most\nemployees an ``open formulary,'' from which they can get any drug\nfor a moderate payment.\n\n   Ms. Palomba said Timken's drug costs have been growing 20\npercent annually. The company tries to minimize the spending by\nreviewing the kinds and amounts of drugs its employees take and\nsometimes recommending changes to an employee's doctor.\n\n   Some California HMOs are squeezing the closed lists even\nfurther, said Debi Reissman, president of Rxperts, a managed-care\nconsulting firm in Irvine, Calif. ``Instead of offering three to\nsix products in every therapeutic class, for example,\nantidepressants or blood pressure drugs, they are moving down to\ntwo or three products,'' she said.\n\n   ``Certain plans may pay for the generic only and offer zero\ncoverage for brand-name drugs,'' said Neeraj Kanwal, executive\nmedical director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in\nIndianapolis. He said other plans pay only the relatively low cost\nof the generic, say $7, while the patient pays $53 for a $60 brand.\n\n   But he said there was ``a backlash against closed formularies.''\n\n   ``They are not a popular item for customers,'' Kanwal added.\n","Headline":"\nPATIENTS FACING HIGHER COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS \n","Text":["\n   Patients across the country are facing steep increases in\nout-of-pocket charges for prescription drugs, reversing a recent\ntrend toward more liberal coverage.\n","\n   Standard co-payments are often doubling for drugs that patients\nhave been using for years.
