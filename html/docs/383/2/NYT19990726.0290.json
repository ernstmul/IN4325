Times News Service   \n\n   Nadine McGann is thinking very hard, but she cannot remember the\nlast time she felt joy, or happiness, or even simple pleasure.\n\n   On a good day, she drags herself out of bed after her sister's\ndaily wake-up call, walks her dogs in Prospect Park, in New York,\nand slogs through the afternoon, fighting anxiety, inertia and\nfatigue. On a bad day, she mostly stays in bed. ``I don't really\nknow what it is like to feel good,'' she says.\n\n   Like many people who suffer from depression, Ms. McGann, who is\n37, has heard the public service announcements that proclaim her\ncondition to be eminently treatable.\n\n   She has seen the advertisements for Prozac and Zoloft and Luvox\nand a dozen other anti-depressant drugs, old and new, promotions\nthat show smiling men and women happily going about their lives.\nShe can cite the studies showing that certain types of\npsychotherapy are effective for depression, especially when\ncombined with anti-depressants.\n\n   Ms. McGann's own experience, however, has been slightly\ndifferent: In the five years since her latest battle with the\nillness began, she has tried virtually every treatment the\nmental-health field has to offer _ and not one of them has worked.\nNot drugs, either singly or in combination, not psychotherapy, not\nthe electroshock therapy she received in 1995.\n\n   Recently she had a device implanted under her collarbone that\ndelivers electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve in her neck _ a\nprocedure that has proved effective for some forms of severe\nepilepsy, and that Columbia University researchers are trying on an\nexperimental basis in depression. But so far that treatment, too,\nappears to be failing.\n\n   As a last resort, she said, she may decide to undergo a\ncingulotomy, a form of brain surgery in which fibers deep in the\nfrontal lobe are severed.\n\n   ``It is very frustrating,'' she said. ``I'm sort of running out\nof options.''\n\n   Ms. McGann's case is extreme: She is unable to work, and her\nlife is severely limited by her illness. But there are many others\nwho share her plight to some degree.\n\n   Depression, a recurrent illness that afflicts more than 19\nmillion Americans over the age of 18, in some cases is considerably\nmore difficult to treat than the drug advertisements suggest.\n\n   Psychiatrists estimate that 60 percent to 70 percent of people\nwho can tolerate the side effects of anti-depressants get better\nwith the first drug they take. But 10 percent do not respond _ even\nafter trials on many different drugs. And still others _ the\nestimates of how many vary _ get better but do not recover\ncompletely.\n\n   ``They feel somewhat improved,'' said Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman\nof psychiatry at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in\nChicago, an expert in what doctors call ``refractory'' or\n``treatment-resistant'' depression. ``They might be able to\nfunction. But they don't really enjoy life.''\n\n   For such people, finding help can become a full-time occupation.\nThey wait impatiently for each new anti-depressant to reach the\nmarket. They go from doctor to doctor, hoping the next physician or\ntherapist they consult will be able to provide relief.\n\n   Ms. McGann, for example, has tried at least 20 different\npsychiatric drugs, and is now taking six: Effexor, an\nanti-depressant; Clozaril and Risperdal, both anti-psychotic\nmedications; Adderall, a stimulant; and Klonipin, an anti-anxiety\ndrug.\n\n   She has consulted five psychotherapists from a variety of\ntheoretical schools, as well as three experts in\npsychopharmacology. Her present therapist specializes in\ncognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, which has been shown effective\nin treating depression.\n\n   A 45-year-old Boston woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said\nshe had consulted more than 40 therapists for the depressions she\nhad experienced since childhood. Prozac was effective for a while,\nshe said, but then it stopped working _ a phenomenon sometimes\nreferred to as the ``poop-out'' syndrome. Other drugs and\ncombinations of drugs failed as well. She recently decided to\nundergo electroshock therapy.\n\n   ``I don't feel like I have choice,'' she said. ``This illness\nhas taken my life away.''\n\n   Many clinicians, faced with patients who do not improve, ``tend\nto throw up their hands,'' said Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of\npsychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\n   And even psychiatrists who specialize in treating difficult\ncases may resort to a hit-or-miss strategy with treatment-resistant\npatients, trying out any new approach they have heard about from\ncolleagues or seen mentioned in the journals.\n\n   They may shift patients from one medicine to another, add other\ndrugs like lithium, amphetamines, beta blockers, anti-psychotics or\nthyroid hormone, and recommend electroshock if drugs and\npsychotherapy fail. Sometimes patients get better; sometimes they\ndo not.\n\n   ``Treatment-resistant depression is a continuum,'' said Dr.\nHarold Sackheim, chief of biological psychiatry at the New York\nState Psychiatric Institute. ``Some people don't do that well with\nfirst treatment, but they respond to the second. Some will go 20\nyears and nothing helps them.''\n\n   In the most dire and intractable cases, some physicians turn to\nexperimental approaches like vagus-nerve stimulation, which\nSackheim's institute is studying as a treatment for refractory\ndepression, or even cingulotomy, which has been found to help some\npeople for whom nothing else works.\n\n   Researchers know little about why some people respond fully to\nanti-depressant treatment and others do not. In some cases, the\ndifference may lie in brain structure or brain chemistry: Different\npeople respond differently to any type of drug.\n\n   But some patients who are deemed refractory may also simply have\nreceived inadequate treatment, taken a drug at a dosage too low to\nbe effective or discontinued the medication before the four to six\nconsecutive weeks that most experts consider a reasonable trial.\n\n   Complicating things further, many patients who do not respond to\nanti-depressant treatment are not only depressed but have other\ndifficulties as well: medical or neurological conditions, for\nexample, or other psychiatric problems like substance abuse, panic\nattacks or personality disorders.\n\n   ``The frustration,'' Kupfer said, ``is that there are a number\nof different factors where The final common denominator is that\npeople are not feeling better.''\n\n   And while experts agree that most types of severe or recurrent\ndepression have their roots in biology, psychology plays a role as\nwell. Dr. Judith Nowak, a psychopharmacologist and psychoanalyst in\nWashington, said that in her experience some people who did not\nrespond to anti-depressants or combinations of drugs had\ncomplicated life problems that could ``only be understood, managed\nand corrected through psychological intervention.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   ``I've seen several people who had lifelong refractory\ndepression and got caught in a loop of many experimental medication\nregimens,'' Dr. Nowak said. ``But it really was through good\npsychotherapy that they were helped.''\n\n   A large part of the problem is that there have been few\nsystematic studies of refractory depression, or of how best to\ntreat patients who do not improve after routine treatments. In\nparticular, said Kupfer, little is known about treatment\nsequencing: When is it best to follow one drug with another or to\nadd a different drug? When is it best to use psychotherapy in\naddition to drugs?\n\n   Drug companies, eager to prove their products are effective for\nlarge numbers of patients, conduct short-term clinical trials to\nestablish the efficacy of individual anti-depressants, but have\nlittle interest in conducting studies of anti-depressant failure,\nor exploring strategies for treating patients who remain depressed\nor show only partial improvement.\n\n   Academic researchers have largely ignored the topic, and what\nresearch exists, said Dr. Matthew Rudorfer, associate director for\ntreatment research at the National Institute of Mental Health, is\n``haphazard'' at best. Many studies were conducted using older\nanti-depressants, Rudorfer said, or included only small numbers of\npatients or lacked rigorous scientific controls.\n\n   In the hope of stimulating more research, the institute has\ndecided to sponsor its own clinical trial on treatments for\nrefractory depression, and will award a multimillion dollar\ncontract this fall to the research team with the most compelling\nplans for a large-scale national study.\n\n   ``There is an enormous gap between a lot of people out there\nsuffering and what we really could do about it,'' said Dr. Steven\nHyman, director of the mental-health institute. ``People deserve\nthe data.''\n\n   The institute's trial, Hyman said, will include psychotherapy as\nwell as anti-depressant drugs, which most mental-health experts\nbelieve are an essential component of treatment. But the project,\nhe said, is still only a beginning, and many more studies will be\nneeded before researchers can offer patients much solace.\n\n   Meanwhile, Ms. McGann, and others who suffer similarly, can only\nhope, and live from day to day. ``I feel like I'm not a person\nright now,'' she said. ``And I don't feel like I can make any\ndecisions about my future. That's the worst part of it.''
