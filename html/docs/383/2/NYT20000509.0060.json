One of its early\ntargets was Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of\npsychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a McLean Hospital\nresearcher, who wrote a crucial paper on the link between suicide\nand Prozac in 1990; he found that 3.5 percent of patients put on\nProzac either attempt or commit suicide due to severe agitation\nfrom akathisia. As a result of Lilly's campaign, many in the\npsychiatric community say they believe Teicher has distanced\nhimself from his original work. But in a rare interview with the\nGlobe, Teicher said that he stood by his work, and that the ability\nof Prozac to induce suicide in a minority of patients ``is a real\nphenomenon.''\n\n   Teicher, Barberich, and Young filed their patent for the new\nProzac in August 1993, the same year Teicher published another\nreport, this one in the journal Drug Safety titled ``Antidepressant\nDrugs and the Emergence of Suicidal Tendencies.''\n\n   The paper was a direct challenge to data reported in the March\n1991 issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry by Drs. Maurizio\nFava and Jerrold Rosenbaum of Massachusetts General Hospital. Their\nstudy found no significant difference in ``suicidal ideation'' in\npatients treated with fluoxetine compared to those receiving other\nantidepressants.\n\n   Teicher wrote in his 1993 paper that Fava and Rosenbaum's\nstatistics were flawed. Using Fava and Rosenbaum's data, Teicher\ncame to the opposite conclusion: namely, that patients on Prozac\nwere at least three times more likely to become suicidal than those\non older antidepressants.\n\n   The FDA came up with similar results even before Teicher\npublished his 1993 data. Dr. David Graham, chief of the FDA's\nEpidemiology Branch, wrote on Sept. 11, 1990, that Lilly's data on\nsuicide and Prozac, as well as the Fava and Rosenbaum study, were\ninsufficient to prove that Prozac was safe. In an internal FDA\nmemo, Graham wrote: ``Because of apparent large-scale\nunderreporting, the firm's analysis cannot be considered as proving\nthat fluoxetine and violent behavior are unrelated.''\n\n     \n   \n``Prozac Backlash''\n\n     \n  \n\n   Now a decade later, Lilly has targeted Dr. Joseph Glenmullen,\nwhose book ``Prozac Backlash'' has apparently incensed Lilly\nexecutives.\n\n   Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School and a clinician at the Harvard University Health\nServices, says he wrote the book because he was alarmed by the\nnumber of patients who were reporting severe side effects from the\nserotonin-boosting antidepressants including Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft,\nand Luvox. ``The two most upsetting side effects were patients\nbecoming suicidal on the drugs, and the development of disfiguring\nfacial tics,'' he said in an interview.\n\n   After obtaining hundreds of pages of FDA documents through the\nFreedom of Information Act, as well as internal Lilly memos that\nare part of the public record in lawsuits filed against the drug\ncompany, Glenmullen wrote that Lilly had tried to downplay side\neffects of Prozac for years.\n\n   Lilly alerted newspapers and TV stations to the book and began a\ncampaign to discredit the author, saying that Harvard Medical\nSchool professors were unfamiliar with his work and didn't\nrecognize his name.

Not only\nwas his 1991 study on Prozac and suicide criticized by at least two\nsets of researchers as well as the FDA, documents obtained by the\nGlobe show that Rosenbaum's relationship to Lilly is a cozy one: he\nhas served as a Prozac researcher and sat on a marketing advisory\npanel for Lilly before Prozac was launched.\n\n   When asked in an interview why he was speaking out against\nGlenmullen's book, Rosenbaum said that the suicide controversy was\n``old news'' and that the book presents the information as new\nresearch.
