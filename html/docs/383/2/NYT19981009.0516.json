The new drugs,\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, bolster\nserotonin, a brain chemical believed to be deficient in some\ndepressed people.\n\n   The drugs they largely displaced, a class called tricyclics, had\noperated by bolstering the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine\nin the brain but sometimes caused severe side effects.\n\n   No one, including Lilly's top executives, could have predicted\nProzac's effect on the world. In less than 10 years, it played a\nhuge role in making depression a socially acceptable illness.\n\n   In 1988, only 130.7 million prescriptions were written in the\nUnited States for psychotherapeutics, which include antidepressants\nand antipsychotic and anti-anxiety drugs. Prozac, or fluoxetine\nhydrochloride, had 1.45 million of the total, according to IMS\nHealth. By last year, the category had expanded to 232.6 million\nprescriptions, with Prozac contributing 9.88 million.\n\n   With that success, it appears, it was easy for Lilly to get\ncomplacent. ``It is a valid criticism that we have a gap in our\npipeline,'' said Dr. August M. Watanabe, executive vice president\nfor science and technology at Lilly. ``But the reason we call\nProzac's expiration Year X is because we are not certain when it\nis. And we may have plenty of time to develop new drugs.''\n\n   Lilly has several options to protect Prozac's market, but none\nare easy. Industry analysts have long expected the company to\nlicense a new version of Prozac from Sepracor Inc., a specialty\npharmaceutical company in Marlborough, Mass., known for improving\nexisting drugs largely by eliminating their side effects. Such a\ndeal, analysts say, could secure Lilly's franchise, minimizing any\npotential loss of sales.\n\n   Lilly's chief executive, Taurel, declined to discuss the\nlikelihood of an agreement with Sepracor, and Sepracor officials\nalso declined, perhaps because no alliance is in the offing. Last\nweek, David P. Southwell, Sepracor's chief financial officer, said\nthe company was pondering several options for its purified form of\nProzac. Sepracor itself might market the drug, for example, or\nlicense it to one of Lilly's rivals, including Schering-Plough or\nJohnson & Johnson.\n\n   ``We have 65 salespeople now,'' Southwell said. ``We didn't have\nany two months ago. When we looked at the revenue stream _ we try\nto get royalties from our products instead of taking cash up front\n_ we discovered we'd make more money selling it with this little\nsales force than if we licensed it to another company. But we are\nstudying several possibilities.''\n\n   Another potential problem for Lilly is Barr's challenge on the\nProzac patents. If Barr is successful, it will be allowed to sell a\ngeneric version of the drug exclusively for six months before other\ncompetitors can crowd in. Downey expects generic Prozac to take 75\npercent of the brand's sales _ about $2.25 billion _ in those first\nsix months on the market.\n\n   Taurel dismissed the notion that Lilly could lose Prozac's\npatents before 2003. But if he thought he might lose to Barr in\ncourt, he probably could afford to buy himself a little leeway.\nBecause Barr is relatively tiny, with only $377 million in annual\nsales, analysts have long speculated that Lilly could settle the\ndispute, giving Barr a cash payment of $50 million or so and the\nright to make generic Prozac sometime before 2003, but not as soon\nas if Barr had prevailed in court.\n\n   However, a settlement appears unlikely. Downey, who spent 25\nyears as a trial lawyer, said on Friday: ``My goal is to win and\nlaunch. If there is a settlement, that will be up to the other\nside.'' Taurel declined to comment on any of these possibilities.\n\n   Any deal-making that sustains Prozac's hold on the marketplace\ncould leave many psychiatrists dissatisfied. Although doctors\ngenerally agree that SSRIs are the best antidepressants yet, they\nhave complaints about every drug in the category _ Prozac in\nparticular.\n\n   Paxil, by SmithKline Beecham; Zoloft, Pfizer's entry in the\ncategory, and Celexa, a new SSRI by Warner-Lambert and Forest\nLaboratories, can take as long as five weeks to take full effect.\nProzac can, too _ but it takes as long as four weeks to wash out of\na patient's bloodstream after use is discontinued, meaning that\ndoctors must wait that long before prescribing another drug. Prozac\ncan also cause anxiety at first use.\n\n   Moreover, all four drugs, which together control about 96\npercent of the American antidepressant market, can cause sexual\ndysfunction. Adding to that misery, SSRIs have no therapeutic\neffect in 20 percent of all cases and cannot be safely mixed with\nseveral other commonly used medications.\n\n   Prozac ``has not always been effective with people on either end\nof the scale, the ones who are barely impaired and those who are\nvery ill,'' said Dr. Donald Klein, director of research at the New\nYork State Psychiatric Institute. ``But Prozac is very effective\nwith people in the middle.''\n\n   Few drug makers can afford to stumble in the race for a new\nbest-selling antidepressant. Investors have come to expect\nquarterly earnings gains of 20 percent or higher from the big\npharmaceutical companies, leaving little room to write off hundreds\nof millions of dollars in research and development costs for a drug\nthat does not work.\n\n   To avoid such losses, drug companies typically try to develop\nmultiple uses for a single compound. The trailblazer is this regard\nwas Glaxo Wellcome's antidepressant Wellbutrin, which last year\nalso began sales as Zyban, a smoking-cessation medication.\n\n   With Prozac coming off patent, Lilly has learned to play this\ngame, too. One of its two new antidepressants is also under\ndevelopment as a treatment for incontinence, an ailment that\nappears to be medically unrelated. The drug, duloxetine, is\nexpected to be released in 2001 as an anti-incontinence pill and a\nyear later as an antidepressant.\n\n   Some Lilly rivals say that the plans for duloxetine are a sign\nof desperation _ that it is a lackluster antidepressant being\ntrotted out to market only because the company lacked a more\nformidable replacement for Prozac.\n\n   Lilly officials acknowledge that they took another look at\nduloxetine because of the approach of Year X, but they say the\nlater, more accurate tests proved the drug a more effective\nantidepressant than had been originally believed.\n\n   Lilly says it also hopes that duloxetine will take effect more\nquickly than Prozac. But it is unlikely to be as popular. Watanabe\ndescribed duloxetine as similar to Effexor, the new antidepressant\nof American Home Products.
