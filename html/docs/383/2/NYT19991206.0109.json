Times News Service   \n\n   By the time most psychiatrists encounter schizophrenia, its\nsymptoms are already in full flower. But scientists have long\nsurmised that the illness starts much earlier, the demons beginning\nto nibble at the edges of young people's lives well before the most\nflagrant psychosis appears.\n\n   Now researchers are beginning, in a systematic way, to\ninvestigate the earliest stages of schizophrenia, attempting to\nfind signs that could predict its onset.\n\n   Two research groups are adopting a much bolder strategy: They\nare identifying young people at risk and treating them with low\ndoses of anti-psychotic drugs, even though they do not exhibit the\nfull-blown symptoms of the illness.\n\n   By comparing those who take the drugs with other high-risk\nsubjects who do not, the researchers, at the Yale School of\nMedicine and the University of Melbourne in Australia, hope to find\nout if such early intervention can keep the illness at bay, and to\nlearn more about the factors that predict vulnerability.\n\n   The researchers are using the newest anti-psychotic drugs,\nmedications much less likely to produce serious side effects than\ntheir predecessors. Still, the studies are controversial and have\nfound no shortage of critics.\n\n   Dr. Thomas H. McGlashan, the director of the Yale study, said he\ndecided to begin his prevention trial when he became convinced,\nafter many years of working with patients suffering from\nschizophrenia, that ``80 percent if not more of the damage is done\nbefore the disorder appears.''\n\n   McGlashan cited the findings of as many as a dozen studies\nsuggesting that the earlier schizophrenia was treated, the better a\npatient's prospects were for recovery. After visiting the site of\nthe Australian trial, he said, ``I began to think that there might\nbe a way of preventing chronicity with the treatments we already\nhave.''\n\n   Treating people with drugs for a condition they do not yet have\nis a highly unusual approach in psychiatry, though it has precedent\nin other areas of medicine _ the trial of tamoxifen as a\nprophylactic treatment for women at high risk for breast cancer is\none example _ and is being explored for Alzheimer's and some other\ndiseases.\n\n   Schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders are so\ndevastating that few people would object to the eventual goal of\npreventive treatment.\n\n   Not everyone agrees, however, that the time is right to attempt\nsomething so ambitious, in large part because, despite researchers'\ncontinuing efforts, there is still no set of indicators that can\npredict future illness with any reliability.\n\n   ``Nobody yet knows what the early symptoms are,'' said Dr.\nBarbara Cornblatt, director of the division of high-risk studies at\nHillside Hospital, part of Long Island Jewish Medical Center. With\nthe exception of a family history of schizophrenia, she said, ``We\ndon't even clearly know what the level of risk is; we don't know if\n5 percent or 40 percent who are identified with suspected risk\nfactors are going to become ill.''\n\n   As a result, critics argue, some of the subjects in prevention\nstudies will receive treatment unnecessarily, or be treated for\nwhat turns out to be the wrong problem. Behaviors used in the\nstudies to determine risk, they point out, can also be signs of\nnormal adolescent crisis, or of other psychiatric problems like\ndepression that do not require anti-psychotic drugs.\n\n   Some scientists also question how researchers will know whether\nthe drugs are effective in individual cases. ``If people without\nconvincing symptoms are treated and never develop the illness,\nunder what circumstances would it be ethical for you to discontinue\nthe medication?'' asked Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the\nNational Institute of Mental Health.\n\n   Many critics say they are concerned about the possible stigma\nattached to being labeled at high risk for psychosis, and about the\npotential side effects of even the newest anti-psychotic\nmedications.\n\n   ``We need to go slowly and cautiously,'' said Dr. Laura Lee\nHall, director of research for the National Alliance for the\nMentally Ill, an association of family members and some consumers.\n``On the one hand, I think it's extremely important for us to\nexperimentally determine if we can prevent the most disabling\nconsequences of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. On the other\nhand, I certainly have concerns that we not needlessly medicate\nchildren that may not become sick.''\n\n   One alternative, Hall suggested, might be to monitor patients\ndeemed at high risk but provide treatment only as necessary, as is\ndone in studies conducted by Cornblatt's clinic at Hillside.\nAnother might be to offer preventive measures that are less\nintensive than drugs, like dietary changes or supportive therapy.\n\n   Hall and Cornblatt were among a group of medical ethicists,\nrepresentatives of advocacy organizations and psychiatric\nresearchers _ including McGlashan and Dr. Patrick D. McGorry,\ndirector of the Australian trial _ who met on Nov. 19 and 20 at a\nconference in Washington sponsored by George Washington University,\nto discuss the ethical and scientific issues raised by\nearly-intervention studies in psychiatry. Among the issues\ndiscussed were informed consent, confidentiality and the impact of\nanti-psychotic drugs.\n\n   Such issues are pressing, mental health experts say, and not\nonly because of the studies already under way. In the\nnot-too-distant future, researchers may finally identify genes that\npredispose people to disorders like schizophrenia and manic\ndepression, opening the way for genetic testing, like that\navailable for Huntington's disease or breast cancer. Advances in\npsychopharmacology are likely to yield a new generation of\nanti-psychotic drugs that are more effective and safer than those\nnow on the market.\n\n   These developments will make it easier to determine and quantify\nrisk, and will offer new opportunities for early treatment. But\nethicists and researchers say they will also raise even more\ncomplicated choices for patients, family members, scientists and\nclinicians, who must weigh the costs and benefits in a society\nwhose attitude toward mental illness and those who suffer from it\nis far from neutral.\n\n   ``The risks in some sense are different for early intervention\nin psychiatry than they are in breast cancer, or other illnesses,''\nsaid Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, chairman of the department of\npsychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in\nWorcester. ``One needs to raise the question of what the\nconsequences of labeling a person as preschizophrenic are.''\n\n   Those consequences, Appelbaum pointed out, can include negative\nreactions from employers, health insurers, schools ``and anyone who\nhas to decide whether or not to take a chance on a person,'' as\nwell as from friends and family members.\n\n   In addition, he said, the knowledge that one is at high risk for\nschizophrenia or another severe mental illness can drastically\naffect self-image, particularly in adolescents. A teenager given\nsuch a label, Appelbaum said, might wonder: ``Do I decide that I\nshouldn't get married? That I shouldn't go to college? That I\nshould downgrade my expectations for myself?''\n\n   McGlashan, however, said he believed strongly that people had\nthe right to know if they were vulnerable to schizophrenia or other\nsevere disorders.\n\n   ``Whose civil liberties are you talking about?'' he asked. ``If\nit is the person who is at risk, it seems they ought to know the\ninformation. They can choose to deny it if they want, but at least\nthey should be given the opportunity to deny it.''\n\n   nn\n\n    \n\n   On the question of informed consent, researchers are equally\ndivided. The issue of whether subjects in prevention trials are\nfully aware of the consequences of accepting treatment is\nparticularly sensitive, critics say, in studies involving teenagers\nor very young children, where parents are the ones who must provide\nthe consent.\n\n   McGorry, the director of the Australian study, said he had no\ndoubt that the subjects in his study _ the youngest of whom are in\ntheir mid-teens, the oldest in their 30s _ were fully able to give\ninformed consent.\n\n   ``It's not the situation where you have a psychotic patient\nincompetent to consent to treatment,'' said McGorry said. ``These\npatients are very much in touch.''\n\n   McGorry, who is the co-author of ``The Recognition and\nManagement of Early Psychosis'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999),\nsaid his study had aroused little controversy in Australia, perhaps\nbecause that country has a more developed community network for\ntreating mental illness in adolescents, and because the social\nconsequences of a diagnosis of mental disorder are not as severe\nthere.\n\n   Yet both he and McGlashan are well aware of the difficult\nquestions their studies raise, and they have both gone to some\nlengths to address them.\n\n   Before beginning the prevention trial, the Australian\nresearchers conducted a preliminary study to test the criteria they\nwere using to determine high risk. Monitoring patients who met the\ncriteria, they found that 40 percent went on to develop a psychotic\nillness _ a high enough percentage, they felt, to warrant\nattempting to intervene.\n\n   All the subjects in the study, McGorry said, had come to his\nclinic requesting treatment.\n\n   Since the study began in 1996, he added, 4 of the 31 subjects\nwho for six months received low doses of the anti-psychotic drug\nRisperdal and a specially tailored form of psychotherapy developed\npsychosis in the six months after they were taken off the drug.\n\n   In the control group, those who received only psychotherapy, 10\nof 28 subjects became psychotic. McGorry said that the difference\nbetween the groups was significant, both clinically and\nstatistically, but he added that the study was small and more\nresearch needed to be done.\n\n   In contrast to the participants in the Australian trial, neither\nsubjects nor researchers in the Yale study know which participants\nare on medication _ in this case the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa _\nand which are getting dummy pills. Subjects receive the medication\nfor a year, then are monitored for another year. The study has\nenrolled 22 subjects between the ages of 12 and 45, but the\nresearchers hope eventually to include 80 participants.\n\n   All the subjects, McGlashan said, had been experiencing some\nsymptoms before they enrolled, including social withdrawal, trouble\nconcentrating, changes in personality, deterioration of personal\nhygiene, decline in academic performance and perceptual oddities,\nlike seeing lights or shapes that are not there or hearing strange\nnoises.\n\n   The Yale study is financed in part by Eli Lilly & Co., which\nmakes Zyprexa, and by grants from the National Institute of Mental\nHealth and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and\nDepression.\n\n   McGlashan said that when he told colleagues about his research,\ntheir reactions were divided. ``Some say `How can you put these\npeople on placebo?' and some say `How can you put them on drugs?'''\n\n   But he said he remained convinced that trying to do something to\nprevent schizophrenia was better than doing nothing.\n\n   ``Psychosis,'' McGlashan said, ``is not a benign state of\nmind.''\n","Headline":"\nRESEARCHERS ARE SEARCHING FOR _ AND TREATING _ EARLY SIGNS OF\nSCHIZOPHRENIA \n","Text":["\n   By the time most psychiatrists encounter schizophrenia, its\nsymptoms are already in full flower.
