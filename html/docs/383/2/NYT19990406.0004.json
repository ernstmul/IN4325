Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The case of a schizophrenic man who is accused of\npushing a woman to her death under a subway train in January has\ngenerated new interest in proposals authorizing involuntary\ntreatment for mental patients in New York.\n\n   The measures include one initiated by Attorney General Eliot\nSpitzer, who took office immediately after the Jan. 3 incident in\nwhich Kendra Webdale, 32, was pushed off a subway platform.\n\n   On videotape and in written statements, Andrew Goldstein, 29,\nconfessed to having pushed Ms. Webdale. Goldstein told police that\na psychotic episode caused him to believe that a ``spirit or\nghost'' had entered his body and forced him to commit the act.\n\n   On Monday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Goldstein was\nfound competent to stand trial on a charge of second-degree murder.\n\n   Spitzer's proposal would enable relatives and doctors to compel\nthe mentally ill to receive treatment and medication. As state laws\nstand now, involuntary treatment is largely limited to patients who\nare considered a threat to themselves or others.\n\n   Elizabeth Connelly, an Assembly member from Staten Island, has\nintroduced a bill to extend and expand a five-year-old pilot\nprogram at Bellevue Hospital Center for involuntary outpatient\ntreatment. The state Legislature is not likely to embrace changes\nin the system fully during this session, lawmakers say. But there\nis support for extending the Bellevue program.\n\n   James Brennan, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is chairman of the\nAssembly's Committee on Mental Health, said the Bellevue program\nhad not demonstrated that it was necessary now to authorize\nstatewide involuntary treatment for mental patients.\n\n   But he added that the Bellevue program did provide one important\nlesson: that mentally ill patients, once released from hospitals,\nwould maintain their treatment regimen so long as they have support\nservices, like intensive case management and occasional home visits\nby a nurse. ``So my position is that it should be incrementally\nexpanded to see if there is further value to it,'' he said. Brennan\nsaid he has proposed legislation that in addition to extending the\nBellevue program by a few years would start similar programs at\nfour unspecified institutions.\n\n   The issue is also being carefully considered by Gov. George\nPataki. Chuck Deister, a spokesman for the governor, said the\nadministration was in the midst of drafting a proposal but offered\nno details other than to say it was intended to provide a sound\napproach to involuntary treatment.\n\n   The effort to change state laws is strongly supported by many\nmental patients' families, who now are powerless to initiate\ntreatment for relatives too ill to recognize they need it. The\nproposals are fiercely opposed by a small but vocal number who see\nany enforced treatment as a violation of fundamental civil rights\nand a regression to the thinking that fostered the insane asylums\nof the past.\n\n   Advocates of the new measures invoke images of people like\nGoldstein, who drifted from treatment to treatment until a ``ghost\nor spirit or something like that,'' as police reported he said, led\nhim to push a total stranger to her death. In the parlance of\nmental treatment, Goldstein was noncompliant: He did not stay on\nhis medication.\n\n   The supporters include an unlikely combination of psychiatrists\nwho believe in the efficacy of new medications, and law-and-order\nconservatives who want to get the mentally ill off the streets.\nTheir group also points to the large number of people with mental\ndisorders among prison inmates and the homeless, arguing that many\nof them might be safer if they were compelled to take medication.\n\n   ``In the past 10 years, it's been firmly established that mental\ndisease is a neurobiological condition,'' said Carla Jacobs, a\ndirector of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the largest\ngroup advocating involuntary commitment. ``So we have to start\nlooking at mental illness like any other disorder. If I have a high\nfever, people would take me to the hospital and give me medication\nuntil I could continue or discontinue it on my own. But we don't do\nthat in mental illness. We put a special shroud on the ill, we\ntreat them like lepers, and we cloak inaction with false ideas of\nhuman rights.''\n\n   The opponents invoke the images of the cruel asylums of the past\n_ images that generated a powerful movement in the 1960s against\nthe enforced institutionalization of the mentally ill and emptied\nmany state institutions. Many also cite reports of patients who\nsuffered terrible side effects from medications, or were abused in\npublic institutions.\n\n   ``There's an assumption on the part of psychiatrists and the\nmainstream and family members that if a person doesn't take\nmedication, they `decompensate,''' said Rosary Marinaro, mocking\nthe term used in psychiatric treatment to describe patients who\nrevert to unstable behavior. Miss Marinaro, a woman with\nschizophrenia, has campaigned against the proposed laws, and is a\nleader of the Coalition to Stop Outpatient Commitment\n\n   ``There are alternatives,'' she said. ``But the alternatives\nchallenge the medical professions _ things like peer support,\npeer-run services. I have chosen not to take medication. They told\nme to take lithium. But my friend is dead, she went into renal\nfailure, she died last year. I choose. That's the point.
