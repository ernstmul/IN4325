The trial ended with a verdict in Lilly's\nfavor; the family has appealed.\n\n   ``Lilly wanted a verdict that it could herald in the marketplace\nas being the definitive vindication of their claims, and they were\nwilling to get it by withholding important information from the\njudge and jury,'' said Houston lawyer Andy Vickery, who represents\nthe dead couple's adult children.\n\n   Vickery said he decided to file the lawsuit after reading a May\n7 report in The Boston Globe in which the patent language for the\nnew drug was publicly disclosed for the first time.\n\n   A spokesman for Lilly declined comment on the suit Wednesday,\nsaying the company had not seen it.\n\n   Whatever the outcome, the lawsuit seems certain to fuel a\nrevival of a longstanding dispute over the Indianapolis drug\ncompany's efforts to blunt criticism of the popular antidepressant,\na green-and-white capsule that has earned the company billions of\ndollars and become a totem of modern life.\n\n   ``To me the new patent can be compared to the tobacco papers.\nIt's a pharmaceutical company document that acknowledges this\ndangerous side effect which has been downplayed by Eli Lilly and\nother pharmaceutical companies for a decade,'' said Dr. Joseph\nGlenmullen, a Cambridge, Mass. psychiatrist whose new book,\n``Prozac Backlash,'' has helped to trigger the renewed controversy.\n\n   Lilly has built its defense of Prozac on a 1991 finding by the\nUS Food and Drug Administration that there is no credible evidence\nlinking Prozac to suicide. Glenmullen and others have challenged\nthat finding, alleging it was based on flawed clinical testing and\nmarred by conflicts of interest among several members of the FDA's\npanel of outside experts.\n\n   Though sales have slipped somewhat in recent years as other\nantidepressants entered the market, more than 35 million people\nworldwide have taken Prozac. Lilly derived more than 25 percent of\nits $10 billion in revenues last year from the drug.\n\n   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in Honolulu,\nalso focuses attention on the new drug, which Lilly hopes will\nextend its antidepressant franchise after the last Prozac patents\nexpire in 2004.\n\n   The key patent for the new drug was obtained in 1998 by two\nofficials at Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug company,\nalong with Dr. Martin H. Teicher, an associate professor of\npsychiatry at Harvard University who works at McLean Hospital in\nBelmont, Mass.\n\n   The patent brought Teicher full circle in the Prozac debate: He\nhad ignited the decade-long controversy over suicidality with a\n1990 paper about sudden, self-destructive tendencies among patients\nwho had recently begun taking Prozac.\n\n   The patent describes an antidepressant derived from Prozac that,\nthe inventors claim, is formulated in such a way as to decrease the\ncurrent drug's adverse effects, ranging from headaches and\nnervousness to ``intense violent suicidal thoughts and\nself-mutiliation.'' That claim is based on Teicher's paper.\n\n   Although that patent language directly contradicts Lilly's\nlongtime position on Prozac, the Indianapolis-based drug company\nclearly saw great value in the drug described in the patent.\n\n   In December 1998, Lilly paid Sepracor $20 million for exclusive\nrights to the patent, a portion of which went to Teicher and\nMcLean. Lilly also promised the inventors $70 million in milestone\npayments depending on the new drug's progress through ongoing\nclinical trials, and a percentage of sales if the drug is\nultimately approved and sold.\n\n   Three months after that deal was struck, in March 1999, a\nfederal jury in Honolulu began hearing a civil lawsuit Vickery\nfiled on behalf of the two adult children of the late William and\nJune Forsyth.\n\n   A wealthy couple, married for 37 years, the Forsyths had been\ngoing through a rough patch in their marriage in late 1992 and\nearly 1993. William Forsyth, 63, began suffering panic attacks, and\nin February 1993 his doctor prescribed Prozac. After feeling\nwonderful the first day, Forsyth underwent a change for the worse\nand admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital. After a week, while\ncontinuing to take Prozac, he checked himself out.\n\n   On March 3, 1993, 11 days after he began taking Prozac, Forsyth\nfatally stabbed his wife multiple times with a serrated kitchen\nknife then impaled himself on the blade. Their children blamed the\ndrug for what they said were their father's completely\nuncharacteristic acts.\n\n   Of some 200 lawsuits filed against Lilly claiming the use of\nProzac led to suicide or violence, the Forsyth case was only the\nsecond to yield a verdict. Lilly settled many of the others, and\nthe only other one to reach a jury, in 1994, was widely reported to\nhave been a victory for the company. In fact, it was settled in a\nsecret agreement between Lilly and the plaintiffs.\n\n   Lilly obtained its long-sought courtroom victory in the Forsyth\ncase when the jury said the drug could not be held responsible for\nthe murder-suicide. In the suit filed Wednesday, however, the\nForsyths' children claim the victory for Lilly was tainted by the\nfailure to disclose its link to the new Prozac patent and should be\nset aside for a new trial.\n\n   A key element of Lilly's defense was its claim that if Forsyth\nsuffered from the severe form of agitation his children claim led\nto the deaths, he would have experienced inner and outer\nrestlessness. No one at the psychiatric hospital noticed\nrestlessness in Forsyth before his release, and Lilly's lawyers and\nexpert witnesses used that to refute his children's case.\n\n   In the patent, however, the side-effect is described purely as\ninner restlessless, a condition known as akathisia. Vickery said\nthat difference is crucial because, if the patent had been\ndisclosed at the trial, it would have been a powerful answer to\nLilly's argument that outer restlessness _ characterized by\nrelentless fidgeting _ was required as evidence of the side-effect.\nIt also might have challenged Lilly's overall claims about suicide,\nhe said.\n\n   For instance, a top Lilly scientist, Dr. Gary Tollefson,\ntestified during the trial that it was his opinion ``that there is\nabsolutely no medically sound evidence of an association between\nany antidepressant medicine, including Prozac, and the induction of\nsuicidal ideation (thoughts) or violence.''\n\n   The new patent language, and Lilly's purchase of exclusive\nrights to the invention, might have convinced the jury otherwise,\nVickery said.\n\n   Vickery is basing the suit partly on a 1995 ruling by the US\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which includes Hawaii. That\ncase, Pumphrey v. K.W. Thompson Tool Co. of New Hampshire, involved\nthe death of a man who dropped a handgun manufactured by Thompson.\nThe gun fired, sending a bullet through his heart.\n\n   The court found that Thompson committed a fraud upon the court\nby failing to disclose that it had produced a video that showed the\nsame type of gun fired accidentally when dropped. The court said\nthe existence of the video should have been revealed by a Thompson\nlawyer who knew about it and attended the trial.\n\n   Vickery contends that Lilly acted similarly to Thompson because\na patent lawyer for the drugmaker attended the Forsyth trial but\nnever disclosed the language on suicide in the patent that Lilly\nlicensed from Sepracor.\n","Headline":"\nELI LILLY SUED BY FAMILY OF PROZAC USER WHO KILLED WIFE, HIMSELF \n","Text":["\n   Opening a new front in the battle over Prozac and suicide, the\nfamily of a man who killed his wife then himself while taking the\ndrug are accusing Eli Lilly and Co. of fraud for allegedly\nconcealing damaging details about its blockbuster antidepressant.\n","\n   In a federal lawsuit filed in Hawaii, the family of William\nForsyth claims that Lilly ``committed a fraud on the court'' by\nfailing to tell the family's lawyers about a patent that claims a\nnew version of the drug eliminates side effects of the existing\nProzac, including violent and suicidal thoughts among a small\npercentage of users.\n","\n   Despite consistently denying any link between Prozac and\nsuicide, Lilly has purchased an exclusive license to market the new\ndrug from a Massachusetts company that owns the patent.\n","\n   The suit says Lilly actively concealed the potentially explosive\npatent language during a trial last year over Prozac's alleged role\nin the couple's deaths.
