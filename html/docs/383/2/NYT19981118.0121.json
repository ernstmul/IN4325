Such was the case with Losec, an\nulcer medication, that was being confused with Lasix, a diuretic.\nAt least one person died before drugmaker Merck agreed to change\nLosec's name to Prilosec in the United States.\n\n   Today, that drug, one of the most commonly prescribed in the\ncountry, is sometimes mistaken for Prozac, another high-volume drug\nthat is used to treat depression.\n\n   And so it goes, with Narcan and Norcuron, nelfinavir and\nnevirapine, Premarin and Primaxin. With the proliferation of new\ndrugs on the market, confusion over medications has become a\nserious problem, said Bruce Lambert, a professor at the University\nof Illinois in Chicago.\n\n   His database of drug names has grown to more than 1,100 pairs\nwhere one drug was mistakenly dispensed for another, Lambert said\nTuesday. He was attending the American Association of\nPharmaceutical Scientists meeting in San Francisco to discuss the\nproblem of look-alike and sound-alike drugs.\n\n   Lambert told of his recent study in which pharmacists were shown\na list of drug names and then shown another, longer list and then\nasked whether any of those on the first list also showed up on the\nsecond. When similarly sounding names were on both lists, the rate\nof errors doubled, he said.\n\n   ``The take-home message is: We know that similarity increases\nthe risks of certain kinds of memory errors,'' Lambert said.\n``Therefore, we ought to reduce the similarity in drug names\nwherever possible.''\n\n   The Food and Drug Administration has taken notice. A year ago,\nit began requiring drug companies to get approval ahead of time for\nnew medication names to make sure they are not too similar to ones\nalready on the market.\n\n   The agency also is about to launch a surveillance campaign to\nkeep track of problems that crop up because of similar names, as\nwell as confusing packaging, according to Mike Cohen, president of\nthe Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a private, nonprofit\norganization that tracks prescription errors.\n\n   Companies also are becoming more careful. Several have used\nLambert's database to screen names they are considering for new\ndrugs, he said. The FDA already forbids companies from using names\nthat sound like the condition the drug is intended to treat, or\nthat are similar to the medication's generic name.\n\n   Companies are concerned because they spend hundreds of thousands\nof dollars picking the right name for a new drug, using consultants\nand focus groups that help them identify ones the public likes.\nNaming drugs has become more of an issue in the past few years as\npharmaceutical companies have begun marketing their products\ndirectly to consumers through big advertising campaigns.\n\n   ``Notice how many names have Xs and Zs in them,'' Lambert said.\n``The branding people believe those letters make the names\ndistinctive.''\n\n   Meanwhile, Lambert has developed a computer program for\npharmacists designed to raise a warning flag when a prescription\nfor a commonly confused drug name is presented. It is similar to a\nprogram now used to alert pharmacists when a patient is being\ndispensed two or more drugs that can be dangerous when taken\ntogether.\n\n   With 35,000 drug brand names now registered with the U.S. Patent\nand Trademark Office and another 10,000 used as generic names, the\npotential for mix-ups is great, Lambert said.\n\n   And with doctors' handwriting being what it is, the problem is\nby no means rare. Figures reflecting the scope of the problem are\nhard to come by, but it is on the rise, Cohen said. He said at\nleast 4,000 reports of mix-ups had come into his organization since\n1993.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   ``It's a much worse situation than it was 10 or 15 years ago,''\nCohen said. ``There's a lot more drugs on the market ... and with\nthe pressures on health professionals because of managed care and\nneed to control costs, the staffing is different.''\n\n   Cohen wants doctors to write on the prescription what it is they\nare treating with the drug, so a pharmacist can better figure out\nwhich one they mean. New prescription pads also are being\ndistributed that have icons representing the heart or kidney or\nother body part the drug is supposed to treat.\n\n   But he said patients should also be aware of what they were\ngetting and why and ask their doctors and pharmacists what the drug\nshould look like.\n\n   ``We haven't done a good job teaching patients what they need to\nknow to protect themselves,'' Cohen said.\n","Headline":"\nDELUGE OF NEW DRUGS MAY LEAD TO CONFUSION, EXPERTS SAY \n","Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the new anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa debuted\ntwo years ago, several pharmacists reading those prescriptions\nmistook it for Zyrtec, an antihistamine.\n","\n   At least two dozen times, people prescribed Navane for\nschizophrenia instead got the blood pressure medication Norvasc,\nresearch data has shown.\n","\n   And two heart drugs, amrinone for heart failure and amiodarone\nfor arrythmias, also have been confused, and some patients have\nreceived the wrong one.\n","\n   Some mix-ups have been fatal.
