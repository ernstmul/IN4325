{"DocumentId":"NYT19981008.0166","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-WHITE-COLUMN-BOS \nFINDING THE WIT, LESSONS OF DEPRESSION\n\n         (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By DIANE WHITE  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n\n  \n\n   The literature of depression is enjoying something of a boom,\nwhich is an odd way of putting it, I suppose. There's no doubt that\ndepression is proving a rich source of material for memoirists.\n\n   Memoir writing in general is taking a lot of heat. There are too\nmany bad memoirs being published, some critics say, too much\npointless sharing of pain and solipsistic navel-gazing. In some\ncases, the criticism is probably valid. But a well-written memoir\nthat speaks to the reader's experience is a gift. Martha Manning's\n``Undercurrents'' is one of these, a beautifully executed account\nof the author's descent into depression and her long recovery.\n\n   This column is prompted by Mental Health Awareness Week, which\nends today. Of course every week is mental health awareness week\nfor some of us, whether we like it or not. One of the aims of the\nofficial week is to lift the stigma of mental illness by helping\npeople understand that it's a disease of the brain, not a character\nflaw.\n\n   ``Undercurrents'' is particularly appealing because of Manning's\nremarkable wit. It may seem unlikely that someone could find\nanything funny about depression, but the illness has its absurd\nelements, as many who've struggled with it know. Manning, a\npsychotherapist and college professor in Washington D.C., kept a\ndiary. She describes her life unraveling, in small ways at first.\nWork piles up on her desk. Her house is so filthy her cleaning\nwoman is reluctant to tackle it. She can't sleep. She dresses like\na bag lady. She feels overwhelmed by her patients' problems.\n\n   Eventually, deeply depressed, she checks herself into a\npsychiatric unit: ``I sit on my bed, blankly staring into space. A\nbassett hound walks by my door. I blink hard. Then two chihuahuas\nprance by. A loudspeaker announces that `pet therapy' is beginning\nin the lounge. Pet therapy? Jesus Christ, this is worse than I\nthought.''\n\n   Manning's training as a psychotherapist lends a dimension to her\nobservation of her illness and recovery. The same is true of Lauren\nSlater, a psychologist whose recently published ``Prozac Diary'' is\na sharply observed memoir about her 10-year affair with the drug of\nthe decade. Slater's writing is both eloquent and economical. Her\ndescription of her first responses to Prozac are, as she writes,\n``miracle-tinged,'' and she describes them beautifully.\n\n   Slater's book sheds light on an area that is only beginning to\nbe explored, the experiences of long-term users of the new\nantidepressant drugs. Prozac giveth, but it also taketh away. Those\nwho use it may lose their depression, but they may also feel that\nthey have lost all or part of themselves.\n\n   Like Manning, Slater has darkly humorous moments, as when she's\nwriting about Peter Kramer, author of ``Listening to Prozac,'' and\nhis notion that Prozac is ``cosmetic psychopharmacology,'' that\nmakes users ``better than well.'' To Slater, Prozac is, ``the\nElizabeth Arden of psychopharmacology, a veritable chemical\n`makeover,''' a word that implies trickery, ``an artful application\nof powders and creams to hide unsightly blemishes.''\n\n   Slater has many doubts about the drug that transformed her life,\nthat enabled her to leave behind depression, anorexia, and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder. After she began taking Prozac, she\nearned graduate degrees from Harvard and Boston University,\nmarried, took a job managing an outpatient clinic in East Boston,\nin short, was able to live a ``normal'' life. But she wonders what\nhappened to her self, her original self, before Prozac. ``How much,\nI say to myself, has it cost?'' Her ambivalence about the drug, her\nquestions about its effect upon her life, make ``Prozac Diary''\nfascinating.\n\n    \n\n   (Diane White is a columnist with The Boston Globe.)\n","Headline":"\nFINDING THE WIT, LESSONS OF DEPRESSION\n","Text":["\n   The literature of depression is enjoying something of a boom,\nwhich is an odd way of putting it, I suppose.
