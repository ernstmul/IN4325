MORRIS  \n c. 2000 New York Times  \n World rights  \n\n   Gina Tretter, a 35-year-old St. Louis dietitian, became so\nprofoundly depressed after the birth of her long-desired daughter,\nKatie, that she swore to her husband, ``We're never doing this\nagain.'' Although antidepressants finally brought her out of it,\nshe wouldn't take the risk of having another baby for four more\nyears. What changed her mind was her doctor's promise that if she\nbecame depressed again _ even during her pregnancy _ she could go\nback on the medication.\n\n   Last fall, on Zoloft, she gave birth to Brian. ``I was in love\nwith him from the first minute,'' said Tretter, who still regrets\nthat Katie was deprived of that bond for nearly five months, until\nTretter was stabilized on Zoloft and could take her first child to\nher heart.\n\n   Few experts deny that antidepressants can alleviate the sadness,\nconfusion, anger, insomnia, self-recrimination, dread and loss of\ninterest in virtually everything _ including the baby _ of\npostpartum depression. Nor do they deny that antidepressants can\nlift a depression during pregnancy. Yet many mental health\nprofessionals and women's health advocates worry that these drugs\nare being overprescribed, especially to pregnant and breast-feeding\nwomen.\n\n   ``Many psychiatrists are aggressively treating pregnant women\nwith psychotropic medications when brief, nonpharmacological\ninterventions may be equally effective,'' said Michael O'Hara, a\npsychology professor at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.\n\n   Some widely respected psychiatrists hold similar views. Many are\nold enough to remember the limbless babies born to mothers who took\nthalidomide in the 1950s and early '60s to control morning\nsickness, and the vaginal and testicular cancers that eventually\ndeveloped in children of mothers who took DES (diethylstilbestrol)\nfrom the '40s through the '60s to prevent miscarriage.\n\n   The most commonly prescribed antidepressants, including the\ntricyclic class and the newer selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors, or SSRIs (Prozac, on the market for more than a decade,\nhas been the most studied), reveal no major birth defects.\n``Minor'' anomalies, including oddly shaped earlobes and differing\nwidth of the eyes, have occurred, however. Some premature and\nlow-birthweight babies have also been reported.\n\n   Katherine L. Wisner, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve\nUniversity School of Medicine in Cleveland, recently reported on\nfour studies comparing the birth outcomes of women who had taken\nvarious antidepressants to those of women who had not. They found\nno adverse effects on the behavior, temperament, learning abilities\nor intelligence of the children, some of whom were followed to\ntheir early school years. But beyond that age, no one knows, and\nmany of the antidepressants in use are new, with little or no\navailable data to guide decisions.\n\n   For Tretter, the decision to take a potentially risky drug was\neasy: She would do anything to prevent the hell she and her family\nwent through with her first pregnancy.\n\n   Although the mood swings and teariness of the so-called baby\nblues affect up to 80 percent of mothers within the first days of\ngiving birth, this reactive state usually disappears within a week.\n\n   Any time in that first year, however, 10 percent to 15 percent\nof women develop a postpartum depression that meets clinical\ncriteria; another 5 percent or 10 percent experience an extended\nperiod of bothersome symptoms. One or two in 1,000 develop\npostpartum psychosis, the state in which infanticide and suicide\nare most common.\n\n   Although women are most prone to depression throughout their\nreproductive years, in the first six months after the birth of a\nchild ``the vulnerability is higher than any other half-year period\nof a woman's life,'' said Dr. Nada L. Stotland, a professor of\npsychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago.\n\n   Like most depressions that a woman endures, this too shall pass\n_ eventually. Without intervention, postpartum depression can last\nfrom eight months to more than a year, or it may never resolve\ncompletely. Any depression that is untreated means another is more\nlikely in the future. Among women who have had one postpartum\ndepression, the chances increase sevenfold that it will happen in a\nsucceeding pregnancy.\n\n   Perhaps the most alarming consequence is the depressed new\nmother's inability to bond with and nurture her child. Studies show\nthat infants of depressed mothers are slower to interact with\npeople and objects. They may have poor motor skills and trouble\nregulating their emotions. By age 1, they perform comparatively\npoorly on tests of cognitive abilities.\n\n   ``Babies whose mothers were depressed are also at increased risk\nof depression throughout life,'' Stotland said. ``How much is\ngenetic and how much is because these babies spend their early\nmonths looking at tears on a human face, we don't know.''\n\n   For these reasons, mental health practitioners are eager to\ntreat pregnant women, even to prescribe antidepressants throughout\nall three trimesters of pregnancy as well as during breast-feeding.\n\n   ``It's not as if untreated psychiatric disorder is a benign\nphenomenon,'' said Dr. Lee S. Cohen, a Harvard psychiatrist who is\nthe director of the Perinatal and Reproductive Psychiatry Clinical\nResearch Program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n``Severe untreated depression and anxiety during pregnancy are\nassociated with bad fetal outcome, including high rates of\nobstetrical complications and preterm labor.''\n\n   A recent study by Dr. Tapio Kurki, a Finnish\nobstetrician-gynecologist, of 623 healthy women pregnant for the\nfirst time found 2.5 times as much risk in developing\npre-eclampsia, a sometimes fatal rise in blood pressure, among\nwomen who were anxious or depressed early in pregnancy. And, as\nexperts uniformly point out, depressed and anxious pregnant women\ndo not eat or sleep well, exercise or otherwise take care of\nthemselves.\n\n   ``There are worse things than taking medication during\npregnancy,'' said Dell of Duke, noting that it may be less harmful\nfor the fetus to be exposed to medication than to be awash for nine\nmonths in the mother's stress hormones. According to the latest\nthinking among medical experts, some women are especially sensitive\nto normal hormonal cycling. Estrogen and progesterone and other\nreproductive hormones are known to affect brain neurotransmitters,\nincluding serotonin, which regulate mood.\n\n   Sudden shifts in these hormones _ occurring most drastically\nwithin 24 hours of the placenta's breaking free after childbirth _\nare believed to touch off postpartum depression among women who are\nsensitive to changes in serotonin. Thus antidepressants, which\naffect neurotransmitter systems, are currently the drugs of choice.\n\n   Even so, no treatment protocols list medication as the first\nchoice, unless the mother has severe mental illness and she or her\nfetus, or both, are at risk.\n\n   Because symptoms of postpartum depression are not uncommon in\nmothers of newly adopted children (and in fathers as well), the\nbiological argument for medication does not hold up fully.\n\n   Psychological and social factors, including relationship\ndiscord, history of child abuse, lack of preparation for motherhood\nand changes in a woman's role once she becomes a mother are risk\nfactors for depression. The absence of support from friends and\nfamily contributes as well.\n\n   Diane Sanford, president of the Women's Healthcare Partnership,\na behavioral health practice in St. Louis, and the psychologist\nwhom Tretter consulted during her first postpartum depression and\nagain during her second pregnancy, contends that doctors are too\nquick to medicate women. ``That's true of women's health care in\ngeneral,'' she said.\n\n   But Sanford supported Tretter's decision to take\nantidepressants, given her history. Sanford, a coauthor with Anne\nDunnewold of ``Postpartum Survival Guide,'' said that these\nmedications are among the options, including psychotherapy, from\nwhich women should be entitled to choose.\n\n   In reality, the choice might be made by default. ``Most women\ndon't get psychotherapy, because nobody pays for it anymore,'' said\nDr. Charles H. Kellner, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina in Charleston.\n\n   Indeed, Tretter consulted Sanford only once during the torments\nthat followed Katie's birth because her health plan, which covered\nmedication, would not pay for psychotherapy. Her plan changed by\nthe time she became pregnant again, so she was able to visit\nSanford six times during the first trimester, when she was taken\noff the medication. (As commonly happens, the depression returned\nwith renewed strength; Tretter quickly went back on Zoloft.)\n\n   But the most likely alternative for women facing mood and\nanxiety disorders during pregnancy and afterward may turn out to be\nno help at all. It is remarkably common for them to feel ashamed of\nbeing ``bad'' mothers, and to keep their feelings to themselves _\nand for their doctors not to ask.\n\n   (Lois B.
