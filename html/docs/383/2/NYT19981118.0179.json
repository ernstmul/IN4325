Her mind, she said, raced back to a wrenching experience\nfrom her own past.\n\n   She had been in an experiment of some type. Had she too been\nused?\n\n   Prince, a portrait artist who suffers from manic-depression, dug\ninto her medical history and documented a chilling story.\n\n   In 1983, she had been in an experiment in which investigators\nwithdrew her medication, did nothing as she became increasingly\nmanic, and then injected her with apomorphine, a chemical that\nother researchers suspected could provoke psychosis.\n\n   Prince became so delusional that she had to be placed in leather\nrestraints, a descent into madness that didn't fully subside for 10\ndays.\n\n   ``I was never the same person again,'' Prince said. ``My\nperception of myself and who I was completely changed. I had a\nsense of shame and embarrassment. Who would have ever thought that\ndoctors would create psychosis like that?''\n\n   Prince's story provides a window into a troubling corner of\npsychiatric research that continues to this day. She is one of more\nthan 2,000 mentally ill patients who over the past 25 years have\nbeen ushered into a disturbing series of experiments by psychiatric\nresearchers exploring the biology of psychosis.\n\n   In their own published accounts, doctors have told of injecting\nmentally ill patients with drugs designed to exacerbate their\ndelusions and hallucinations. In prestigious journals, they have\ndescribed studies in which they withheld effective anti-psychotic\nmedication from desperate patients who stumbled into hospital\nemergency rooms. In precise, clinical terms, they have reported how\nthey deliberately stopped giving medication to stabilized\nschizophrenic patients in order to see how quickly they became sick\nagain.\n\n   These studies were designed to gain knowledge that might lead to\nimproved treatments for schizophrenia and related illnesses. But\nthe experiments offered no possibility of therapeutic benefit to\nthe subjects and exposed them to some measure of psychic pain and\nrisk of long-term harm.\n\n   Moreover, this controversial line of experimentation has been\nmarked by repeated instances in which researchers failed to fully\ndisclose the risks to the mentally ill patients and obscured their\ntrue purposes.\n\n   Those are the very themes of the story Shalmah Prince pieced\ntogether:\n\n   On Jan. 14, 1983, fearing the onset of a manic episode despite\nthe lithium she had been taking for two years, Prince went to\nUniversity Hospital in Cincinnati seeking help. Her medical records\nshow that she arrived well-groomed, in control of her emotions, and\nthinking fairly clearly.\n\n   Standard procedure would have been to test the lithium level in\nher blood and adjust the dosage, but that's not what happened.\n\n   Prince signed a consent form that said she was agreeing to take\npart in a study designed to ``clearly diagnose her illness.'' In\ntheir research protocol, however, the psychiatrists said the\npurpose of the study was to explore ``schizophrenia subtypes,''\nbased on the patients' response to apomorphine. The consent form\ndidn't mention any risks associated with stopping the medication,\neven though Dr. David Garver, who ran the study, later acknowledged\nin a sworn deposition that without medication, the research\nsubjects might ``have a delusion that they were capable of flying,\nleap out a window, (and) injure themselves.''\n\n   ``They assured me they were there to treat me,'' Prince\nrecalled. ``And I just wanted to be kept safe. I knew that I didn't\nhave insurance and that I was extremely vulnerable. I needed help\nand a regular doctor was $150. So I was really stuck.''\n\n   Without her lithium, Prince quickly deteriorated. By the fourth\nday she was wildly manic, yelling and threatening suicide. She also\n``got in the face'' of another patient, she said, and he started\nbeating her. Still, she was given no medication.\n\n   On the fifth day, researchers injected her with apomorphine. Her\nmanic and delusional behavior soared. During the next three days,\nwhen her friends and family visited, they found her in restraints,\na humiliation that has never left her.\n\n   ``Everything they did to me was for the purposes of their\nresearch,'' she said, her voice tinged with bitterness even today.\n``As my medical record shows, when I went into the hospital I was\ncalm and cooperative. I was just worried and vulnerable. I came out\nthinking I was crazy, and my parents thinking I was crazy, and my\nfriends thinking I was crazy. My family and I believed that every\npsychotic feeling and behavior was natural to me, rather than\ncaused by their experiment.''\n\n   The final blow came when she got a hospital bill. Prince was\nasked to pay nearly $15,000 for the experience.\n\n   Attorney Ken Faller, who defended Garver and his coresearcher,\nDr. Jack Hirschowitz, in a lawsuit brought by Prince, sees her\nexperience differently. ``No one disputes that patients ought to be\ngiven information concerning meaningful risks,'' he said. ``In her\nparticular case ... we don't believe that there were significant\nundisclosed risks involved.''\n\n   Although the judge in Prince's lawsuit said he found the facts\ntroubling, he dismissed Prince's case, saying she should have filed\nher complaint within two years of the experiments. Faller also said\nthat the hospital forgave more than three-quarters of her bill.\n\n   ``She did receive treatment and the treatment benefited her to\nthis day,'' he said. ``She was a sick person when she went into the\nhospital and she came out seemingly in pretty good shape.''\n\n     \n  \n\n   Psychiatric researchers\n\n   called for an accounting\n\n     \n  \n\n   Prince's story, and scores of clinical reports of schizophrenia\nstudies in scientific journals, evoke troubling echoes of past\nstains on American medicine.

At the National Institute of Mental\nHealth, in Bethesda, Md., researchers have been injecting ketamine,\nthe chemical cousin of the notorious street drug angel dust, into\nunmedicated schizophrenic patients.\n\n   Deliberate withdrawal of medication for experimental purposes is\nan element in other active schizophrenia studies.\n\n   ``I think (these experiments) are in a category that is worse\nthan Tuskegee and the radiation experiments,'' said Adil Shamoo,\nprofessor of biochemistry at the University of Maryland School of\nMedicine and founder of the journal Accountability in Research.\n``There are large numbers (of subjects), and these are current\npractices.
