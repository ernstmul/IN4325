But Kenney says the best care still involves a\npartnership of drugs and dialogue. And as taking pills gets more\nhype, he sees less interest in the communication component of\nhealing, whether through therapy or old-fashioned dinner chats.\n\n   Pharmaceutical treatment for troubled teens _ like video games,\nschool security and parenting _ is being re-evaluated since the\nshooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. One of the killers,\nEric Harris, was taking Luvox, a prescription that eases\nobsessive-compulsive behavior and depression. And yet, his parents\napparently were unaware he was building bombs.\n\n   In the aftermath, experts don't know whether Harris was getting\nappropriate treatment. But they are assessing whether the newest\npsychological drugs are so good that they are leading to shortcuts\nin mental health care. In addition, many still have lingering\ndoubts about the wisdom of treating kids with pills scientifically\ntested mostly on adults.\n\n   ``The problem is, these (medications) are not heroin,'' said\nStephen Fried, author of the book ``Bitter Pills: Inside the\nHazardous World of Legal Drugs'' (Bantam, $24.95). ``They're not\nevil. They do miraculous things.\n\n   ``But we need to find safe, solid ways to test them and\nadminister them,'' said Fried, a Philadelphia investigative\nreporter who wrote the book after his wife had a life-altering,\nadverse reaction to an antibiotic. Fried interviewed hundreds of\ndoctors and patients, including teens, about prescription drugs.\n\n   Statistics about depressed children are incomplete. Although it\nis widely believed that about one in three adults will experience a\nmajor depression in his lifetime, far less is known about\ndepression among the young. Community samples have put the number\nof clinically depressed teens between 0.4 percent and 8.3 percent\nof the age group, according to Nadine Kaslow, a professor in Emory\nUniversity's department of psychology and behavioral sciences and\nthe chief psychologist at Grady Health System.\n\n   But depressed teenagers often grow up to be depressed adults,\nwith a much higher rate of suicide and suicide attempts, according\nto a study published today in The Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation. Researchers, following two groups of teens for more\nthan a decade, found that those who were depressed as adolescents\nhad more than five times the increased risk for a first suicide\nattempt during the time period tracked _ and a 14-fold increase of\nrisk over their lifetime.\n\n   And such discoveries are leading to lots of sad, frustrated and\nangry kids getting lots of drugs. For example:\n\n      Almost three out of four family physicians and pediatricians\nsaid they had prescribed an antidepressant to patients under 18,\naccording to a recent survey of 600 doctors presented at the\nPediatric Academic Societies annual meeting. Almost 70 percent said\nthey prescribed the drugs for mild to moderate childhood\ndepression.\n\n      Of the top 10 drugs prescribed ``off-label'' to children, two\nare antidepressants _ Prozac and Zoloft _ according to IMS America\nLTD, a research firm that tracks prescriptions. An off-label use\nmeans the drug is prescribed for conditions or groups of patients\nnot originally intended by the manufacturer or the Food and Drug\nAdministration. Prozac, which is annually prescribed almost 350,000\ntimes to children under 16, ranked sixth. Zoloft, prescribed almost\n250,000 times annually to children under 16, ranked eighth.\n\n   The new popularity of psychopharmacological agents is tied to\nthe development over the past two decades of a new class of\nanti-depressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nor SSRIs. These drugs, which include Luvox and Prozac, are\nconsidered to be much safer than the older types of medications.\nFor example, they don't have the typical side effects of\nsluggishness, constipation and weight gain. And it is also very\ndifficult to overdose on them - a key concern when physicians are\ndealing with depressed or suicidal patients.\n\n   ``I tell my patients not to even try to overdose on Prozac,''\nsaid Ken Fleishman, a psychiatrist and medical director of Laurel\nHeights Hospital, a mental health facility for children in Atlanta.\n``I tell them the only way they're going to succeed in killing\nthemselves on Prozac is if they choked - which is not very\nlikely.''\n\n   And, in many cases, the new drugs are just as effective as the\nolder models, meaning a lot of children could benefit from new\nchemistry with less risk.\n\n   ``The drugs are like night and day,'' said Sue Smith, whose\ndaughter has struggled with depression for years. ``They're so\ngood.''\n\n   Smith's daughter, Danielle, was so violent by the age of nine _\nsetting fires and hurting animals _ that doctors recommended that\nshe leave her child in an institution.\n\n   ``They said, `Leave her here and walk away,''' said Smith,\nexecutive director of the Geogia Parent Support Network, a\nnon-profit organization that aids families in coordinating mental\nhealth care.\n\n   But then Danielle, now 23, stated taking Wellbutrin, a new type\nof anti-depressant, as a teen and her life dramatically changed.\n\n   She was able to come home. Her grades got better. She served on\nthe student council. She graduated from Grady High School and went,\nfor three years, to Piedmont College.\n\n   ``This really gives our kids the chance to lead normal lives,''\nSmith said. ``It's wonderful.''\n\n   Pat Strode, outreach coordinator for the local chapter of the\nNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill, said such drugs are\nparticularly important Georgia, which like other rural southern\nstates has fewer mental-health treatment facilities and options\nthan other regions.\n\n   It's not a case of parents not being willing to seek out good\nmental health services, she said, but a case of finding good mental\nhealth services.\n\n   ``There are very few programs here that can help children\nunderstand their illness,'' said Strode, whose own daughter,\ndiagnosed with schizophrenia, is benefitting from a drug called\nRisperdal. ``So, when that's the case, parents have to be grateful\nfor what they get.''\n\n   But children are different from grown-ups. And perhaps their\nmedication should reflect that, some experts say.\n\n   Children are still growing. They have immature organs and\ndifferent metabolic and immune systems. And sometimes, they respond\ndifferently to medication. For example, Ritalin - which can be used\nto treat narcolepsy in adults - is used to treat attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder in children.\n\n   ``A child is not just half an adult,'' said Jan Stire of the\nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, in the May-June issue\nof the FDA Consumer, the trade magazine of the Food and Drug\nAdministration.\n\n   In the case of teenagers, researchers aren't fully sure how the\nanti-depressants interact with the turbulent waves of hormonal\nchanges during puberty. And in most cases, teenagers initially seek\ntreatment for different reasons than adults. While adults are\ntypically diagnosed with biologically-based depression, most teens\nland in a doctor's office because of other problems like drinking\nor bad behavior. Or they have endured a traumatic event that has\ntriggered the sadness, such as a divorce between their parents or a\nbreak-up with a boyfriend or girlfriend.\n\n   In those cases, it is not appropriate that teens be given a pill\nand sent on their way - even if it's easier for their doctors,\ninsurers and relatives. ``The key here is the drugs take away the\nsymptoms, but they don't take away the problems,'' said Kaslow.\n\n   Doctors recognize certain medications play out differently in\nteens than adults. An anti-anxiety medication might help a grown-up\nhold to a job, for example, but can cause a teen to feel less guilt\nand become more rebellious, Fleishman said.\n\n   But experts say they don't see the trend abating; a combination\nof drugs being safer, cheaper and too many families being more\nwilling to give one member a pill than haul everyone into\ncounseling.\n\n   ``We're going to keep throwing more and more medications at\nthem,'' Fried said. ``Traditionally, children got a lot more\ntherapy because people were afraid to give them drugs.
