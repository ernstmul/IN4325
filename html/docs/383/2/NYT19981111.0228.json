T. MAX \n (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  \n\n   Is it cheating to take a pill that replaces the hard work of\ntherapy? If you are on Prozac, are you your true self? What does it\nmean to be ``on Prozac'' anyway? Wouldn't it be as true to say you\nare ``off depression''? These are the sorts of questions invited by\nLauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' a gentle, illuminating memoir of\nwhat it's like to be cured by America's pre-eminent selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor.\n\n   Slater is in an unusual position to ask and answer her own\nquestions, because thanks to Prozac she has gone from patient to\ntherapist: since 1994 she has been a psychologist working with\nschizophrenics and depressives (a story she tells in her wonderful\nearlier book, ``Welcome to My Country'').\n\n   ``Prozac Diary'' begins in 1988 at McLean Hospital in Belmont,\nMass., where the 26-year-old Slater encounters the substance she\nwill soon think of, only somewhat jokingly, as a willful and\npowerful lover. Her psychopharmacologist, whom she calls ``the\nProzac Doctor,'' has no interest in the talking cure. He is so\npsyched by Eli Lilly's then-new antidepressant that he has a Lucite\nProzac clock, Prozac pen set and Prozac stationery in his office.\n\n   And Slater is obviously in need. Nothing has eased the severe\ndepression that first came over her in her teens. She lives alone\nin a basement apartment in Cambridge, having dropped out of a\ncreative writing program. She has never held a real job or had a\nsignificant relationship. Recently, she has begun to exhibit\nobsessive-compulsive symptoms too. She taps and counts things\nrepeatedly. While once she was the kind of person you didn't notice\n_ a pale, anxious, anorexic-looking girl _ now she is the kind of\nperson you move away from on the bus. So down go the\ncream-and-green pills, first one a day, then ultimately four, for\n80 milligrams total; ``the Big Mac of medicine,'' as she says.\n\n   The results are immediate and spectacular, and make the most\nmoving reading in the book. ``Those first few mornings,'' Slater\nwrites, ``were fairy tales, tall tales, replete with all the bent\nbeauty of a new world.'' Miranda in Cambridge. She is a woman whose\nlife _ or at any rate her view of that life _ tends toward the\nsymbolic. A magician at Faneuil Hall calls her out of the audience\nto take part in a magic trick. She begins browsing real estate\ngive-away papers, as if shopping for her new life. She learns how\nto set an alarm clock, goes to her first rock concert, gets a new\napartment, takes her first road trip, enters her first real\nrelationship. It turns out that despite having had sex several\ntimes, she is still technically a virgin. At a clinic a doctor\nsurgically breaks her hymen.\n\n   I was glad to read this book. It reminds me of the base-line\ntruth about Prozac. During the decade in which it has gone from\nwonder drug to one of the dominant medications of our time (almost\n10 million prescriptions a year in the United States alone), a\nconsiderable and obdurate backlash has formed. True, the walking\nworried take Prozac. True, so do their dogs and cats. No doubt\n``cosmetic psychopharmacology'' _ the phrase comes from Peter D.\nKramer, the author of the best-selling ``Listening to Prozac'' _ is\na concern. If the natural self isn't perfect, take a pill. But\nSlater didn't just have the sniffles. She was more like someone\nwith pneumonia waiting for the invention of antibiotics. And the\nlife she has gone on to have with Prozac as her constant companion\nis remarkable. Surely no one would wish her back buried alive in a\nCambridge basement.\n\n   Yet Slater is too capable an observer of her own psyche not to\nask, in living this momentous and very American tale of hardship\novercome with technology, what she may have lost. ``Much has been\nsaid about the meanings we make of illness,'' she writes, ``but\nwhat about the meanings we make out of cure? Cure is complex,\ndisorienting, a revisioning of the self, either subtle or stark.''\nHer cure took away her sex drive, as it does to many users of\nProzac. And at some point the drug became less effective. The brain\napparently adjusts, trying to return to its old ways. In her case,\nProzac also suppressed her creative self, at least at first. Since\nchildhood she had had voices in her head that took her over when\nshe sat down to write, inducing a mad scribbling over sheets of\npaper. Prozac smothered these voices, and the breaking of her hymen\nfinished them off. The prose style that replaced those voices\n\n   is self-conscious, deliberate, nervous about taking on too much.\nWhich style is really Slater's? Last, Prozac took away her belief\nin God. Depression, anorexia _ these were surely ambiguous gifts.\nBut if 80 milligrams of fluoxetine hydrochloride is all it takes to\nchange who you are, then we are all, obviously, just so many\nchemical compounds.\n\n   Does Slater worry about these questions too much?
