Times News Service   \n\n   A new government report on antidepressants offers some\nconclusions that may surprise Prozac Nation, even if they are no\nsurprise to researchers: Prozac and other drugs of its generation\nare not any better _ or any worse _ than older compounds in\ntreating major depression.\n\n   The report also sounded a note of caution for physicians who\nprescribe new antidepressants for children, and for patients who\nare only mildly depressed: There has not been enough research to\nestablish whether the drugs are effective in either case.\n\n   Psychiatrists who specialize in treating depression said the\nreport, by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research of the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, would help put to\nrest claims that the new drugs make older antidepressants obsolete,\nand the skepticism of those who insist that older drugs remain the\n``gold standard'' for treating severe depression.\n\n   ``Neither of those extremes is accurate,'' said Dr. Matthew\nRudorfer, acting associate director for treatment research at the\nNational Institute of Mental Health, who is familiar with the\nreport. ``The importance of this report is that when one actually\nlooks at the scientific data, it's clear that in the effective\ntreatment of depression, one has many options, all of which work.\nWhat can make the difference, therefore, is how well matched a\ngiven individual with depression is with a given treatment.''\n\n   The report, which examined 32 drugs, including three herbal\ntreatments, was based on a review and analysis of hundreds of\nclinical studies and reports of adverse drug effects. Using a\nstatistical technique called meta-analysis, the researchers were\nable to draw conclusions more sweeping than any individual research\nproject could.\n\n   All the newer drugs, the researchers found, were more effective\nin alleviating major depression in adults than placebo treatments.\nFifty percent of severely depressed patients improved significantly\non the antidepressants, compared with 32 percent of those given\ndummy pills. And the drugs performed just as well as tricyclics,\nthe older class of antidepressants.\n\n   An analysis of long-term studies, the report said, showed that\nnewer antidepressants also are effective in preventing relapse in\npatients who have recovered from an episode of depression.\n\n   The most widely known new antidepressants are the SSRIs, or\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like Prozac. But the new\ngeneration of drugs also includes drugs like Effexor, Wellbutrin\nand Serzone, which have different effects on chemicals in the\nbrain.\n\n   The newer antidepressants do have some advantages over older\nmedicines, said Dr. John W. Williams Jr., an associate professor of\nmedicine at the South Texas Veterans Healthcare System in San\nAntonio, and a co-author of the report. While both new and old\ndrugs have side effects, patients taking newer antidepressants on\nthe whole appear to find the side effects more tolerable, and are\nless likely to stop taking the medicines because of them, Williams\nsaid.\n\n   Still, compared with patients taking tricyclic antidepressants,\nthe report found, patients on the newer drugs are more likely to\nexperience diarrhea, nausea, insomnia and headache. Sexual\ndysfunction is a familiar complaint of patients taking SSRIs, but\nonly a small percentage of studies reviewed in the report mentioned\nthe side effect, and the report's authors concluded that it was\n``reported too infrequently for reliable interpretation.''\n\n   Tricyclics, the report noted, are more likely than newer drugs\nto produce dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision and tremors.\n\n   SSRIs are also significantly less lethal than tricyclic\nantidepressants, making them safer for depressed patients, who can\nrun a high risk of suicide. ``There appears to be less of a risk of\ncompleted suicide with overdose,'' said Williams.\n\n   And the newer drugs, which have a simpler dosing system and do\nnot require periodic blood tests to monitor drug levels, are easier\nfor general practitioners as well as psychiatrists to prescribe. A\nlarge proportion of prescriptions for the drugs is written by\ngeneral practitioners.\n\n   Still, older drugs may be a better ``match'' for some patients\nbecause the side effects of any antidepressant vary from person to\nperson. Some side effects may be less of a problem for some\npatients than for others: A drug that has sedation as a side\neffect, for example, may actually help a depressed patient who is\nhaving trouble sleeping.\n\n   New antidepressants, in particular SSRIs, are often prescribed\nby physicians for mild or minor depression, Williams said, though\nthere are no good estimates of how frequently this occurs.\nNevertheless, the report's authors could find very few well\ndesigned, controlled studies examining the effectiveness of\nantidepressants in minor depression, though some SSRIs appeared in\nsome studies to effectively treat ``dysthymia,'' or chronic\nlow-level depression that may last for years.\n\n   Similarly, the report found that there are few conclusive\nstudies of newer antidepressants in very young patients, leading\nthe authors to conclude in their executive summary of the report\nthat ``data are insufficient to guide management of depression in\nchildren and adolescents.''\n\n   Three herbal treatments _ kava kava, valeriana, and St. John's\nwort _ received mixed reviews in the report. The authors found no\ncontrolled studies, and thus no evidence, for the effectiveness of\neither kava kava or valeriana. Several European studies, however,\nhave found St. John's wort to be more effective in treating\ndepression than placebos.\n\n   Because patients in those studies suffered from different types\nof depression, however, and because the quality and strength of\nEuropean preparations of St. Johns wort differs from those\navailable in the United States, the report's authors resisted\ncoming to firm conclusions about the herbal medicine.\n\n   Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of psychiatry at the University of\nPittsburgh School of Medicine and an expert on the treatment of\ndepression, said that though the new generation of antidepressants\nis now being viewed with more perspective, the fact that new drugs\nare still arriving on the market is in itself encouraging.\n\n   ``As the pharmaceutical companies continue to target their new\ncompounds,'' he said, ``it increases the recognition of depression,\nincreases the likelihood that people are going to get treated and\ndecreases the stigma.''\n","Headline":"\nSTUDY CONTRASTS NEW AND OLD DRUGS USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION \n","Text":["\n   A new government report on antidepressants offers some\nconclusions that may surprise Prozac Nation, even if they are no\nsurprise to researchers: Prozac and other drugs of its generation\nare not any better _ or any worse _ than older compounds in\ntreating major depression.\n","\n   The report also sounded a note of caution for physicians who\nprescribe new antidepressants for children, and for patients who\nare only mildly depressed: There has not been enough research to\nestablish whether the drugs are effective in either case.\n","\n   Psychiatrists who specialize in treating depression said the\nreport, by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research of the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, would help put to\nrest claims that the new drugs make older antidepressants obsolete,\nand the skepticism of those who insist that older drugs remain the\n``gold standard'' for treating severe depression.\n","\n   ``Neither of those extremes is accurate,'' said Dr. Matthew\nRudorfer, acting associate director for treatment research at the\nNational Institute of Mental Health, who is familiar with the\nreport. ``The importance of this report is that when one actually\nlooks at the scientific data, it's clear that in the effective\ntreatment of depression, one has many options, all of which work.\nWhat can make the difference, therefore, is how well matched a\ngiven individual with depression is with a given treatment.''\n","\n   The report, which examined 32 drugs, including three herbal\ntreatments, was based on a review and analysis of hundreds of\nclinical studies and reports of adverse drug effects.
