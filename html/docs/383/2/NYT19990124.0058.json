MORROW   \n \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   A legal battle that could ultimately decide when Americans can\npay a lower price for the popular antidepressant Prozac is set to\nbegin Monday in Indianapolis.\n\n   Eli Lilly & Co., the drug's manufacturer, sued Barr Laboratories\nin 1996 and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Novartis A.G., a year\nlater for infringing its Prozac patents after the two companies\nfiled applications with the Food and Drug Administration to make\ngeneric versions of the drug. The two suits eventually were\ncombined.\n\n   There has long been angst within Lilly's Indianapolis\nheadquarters and anticipation within the drug community over when\nthe Prozac compound, fluoxetine hydrochloride, could be marketed as\na generic. Lilly has one patent on the Prozac compound that expires\nin February 2001; a second patent on the way the drug works is set\nto expire in December 2003.\n\n   Barr, in its application with the food and drug agency that was\nfiled in 1995, claimed that Lilly's patent was invalid in part\nbecause the company did not disclose all relevant information about\nthe drug, thus launching a heated legal battle that has lasted more\nthan three years.\n\n   The stakes are high. Prozac's worldwide sales last year are\nexpected to be about $2.8 billion, almost one-third of Lilly's 1998\nrevenue. Once a drug becomes a generic, the brand's sales sometimes\nplunge 75 percent in a single year, which could sink any drug\ncompany's stock.\n\n   For Barr Laboratories, a company less than one eighty-eighth the\nsize of Lilly , selling a generic brand of Prozac would add $420\nmillion in revenues during the first year, analysts estimate. Barr\nLaboratories' 1998 sales for the year that ended in June totaled\n$377.3 million, a record for the company.\n\n   Consumers, too, have a stake in what happens inside Chief Judge\nSarah Evans Barker's courtroom in the Southern District of Indiana.\nWhile Prozac will one day be sold as a generic, the results of the\ntrial will determine when it will become available. Analysts\nestimate that a generic Prozac may cost 30 percent less than the\npatented brand.\n\n   ``This case is really serious for everybody involved,'' said\nDavid Saks, a managing director at Gruntal & Co. ``But what is\nreally interesting is that this is a trial. Anything can happen.''\n\n   Earlier this month, Barker tossed out two of Barr's claims, a\nsetback that Bruce L. Downey, Barr Laboratories' chief executive\nofficer, called ``disappointing.'' One issue that remains is\nwhether Lilly deliberately withheld information in its patent\napplication, a claim analysts believe may be difficult to prove.\n\n   ``I fully expect to win this case or else I would not have come\nto court,'' said Downey, who spent 20 years as a trial lawyer.\n``With a suit like this, it's a roller-coaster ride with things\ngoing your way and things not. But I don't expect anything to be\ndecided until the court of appeals.''\n\n   Analysts have long expected Lilly to pay Barr Laboratories about\n$200 million to settle the case, an outcome that appears to benefit\nboth companies. With a $200 million check, an amount Lilly can\neasily afford, the company could preserve Prozac's revenue until\nthe patents expired, while Barr could increase revenue by 53\npercent.\n\n   Downey said last week that he was open to a $200 million payment\nor a similar settlement, provided that he was guaranteed that his\ncompany would be the first seller of a generic Prozac.\nUnfortunately, a settlement has not set well with Lilly executives.\n\n   ``Paying out such a settlement would not be responsible to our\nshareholders, especially for a suit we expect to win,'' said Mitch\nDaniels, senior vice president for corporate strategy and policy at\nEli Lilly. ``Why should we pay money for something that we already\nhave? We'd only incite other companies to get money.''\n","Headline":"\nTRIAL IS GETTING UNDER WAY IN PROZAC PATENT LAWSUIT \n (DW)\n","Text":["\n   A legal battle that could ultimately decide when Americans can\npay a lower price for the popular antidepressant Prozac is set to\nbegin Monday in Indianapolis.\n","\n   Eli Lilly & Co., the drug's manufacturer, sued Barr Laboratories\nin 1996 and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Novartis A.G., a year\nlater for infringing its Prozac patents after the two companies\nfiled applications with the Food and Drug Administration to make\ngeneric versions of the drug.
