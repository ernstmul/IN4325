(The Week in Review) \n(bl)  \nBy LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ It was spring when J. Geraldine Jackson first began\nto feel the world closing in on her. It seemed as if she were\nliving in a cave inside her mind. She slept countless hours and\nlost her job. Her heart raced. Sometimes her left leg went numb.\nHer favorite television show, ``The Equalizer,'' a dark drama about\ncrime in Manhattan, no longer held its allure. Noise _ especially\nlaughter _ made her want to fight.\n\n   It was a little smart talk from her sister that finally set her\noff. She pummeled her sister with her fists, grabbed a pocketbook\nand a change of clothes, and fled the housing project in the Bronx\nwhere she lived with her mother. She landed in a homeless shelter.\n\n   ``I had to go,'' Ms. Jackson, 39, recalled. ``I was really\nbeginning to lose it. I had lost it.''\n\n   That day last May marked the final phase of her journey into\nhomelessness, which, she can now see, had begun more than a decade\nago. It took the doctors at the homeless shelter a few weeks to\ngive her problem a name: manic-depression.\n\n   As mental-health experts learn more about mood disorders, it is\nbecoming clear that depression and manic-depression, with its wild\nmood swings, are a significant cause of homelessness.\n\n   Homeless shelters have long been filled with schizophrenics,\npeople whose hallucinations and delusions force them out of jobs\nand homes and relationships. But the link between depression and\nhomelessness is only now becoming clear.\n\n   Much attention has been focused on depression and\nmanic-depression in recent years as a number of prominent _ and\nwell-off _ people have offered public accounts of their battles\nwith the diseases. In ``An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and\nMadness (Vintage Books, 1995), Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a\npsychiatrist, gave a moving portrait of her own battle with\nmanic-depression.\n\n   Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the program with\nArt Buchwald in which they discussed their struggles with\ndepression. William Styron's memoir of his struggle with a deep\ndepression, ``Darkness Visible,'' became a best seller a few years\nago.\n\n   But they all had safety nets, and they were brought back, some\nfrom the brink of suicide, by expensive treatments and dutiful\nfamilies.\n\n   ``I was able to get the best medical care possible,'' said Dr.\nJamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of\nMedicine. Whenever she sees a homeless person, she thinks, ``There\nbut for the grace of God go I,'' she said.\n\n   For Ms. Jackson and others like her, there is no such safety\nnet. It is unclear how many others are in similar situations, but\nDr. Ronald Fieve, a pioneer in the use of lithium to treat\ndepression and manic-depression, said aggressive efforts to\nidentify homeless people with the disorders could significantly\nreduce the population of homeless shelters.\n\n   ``These people are in a state of chronic illness that is\ntreatable,'' said Fieve, who has recruited homeless patients at\nshelters for clinical studies of mood disorders.\n\n   As a rule, doctors say, manic-depression like Ms. Jackson's,\nalso known as bipolar disorder, responds to mood stabilizers like\nlithium, Depakote and Tegretol, but diagnosing the disease can be a\nformidable task because it can appear, in its later stages, like\nschizophrenia. During the highs, manic-depressives can become\ndelusional, like schizophrenics. Because schizophrenia's symptoms\nare easier to diagnose, emergency-room doctors and shelter\noperators are much more likely to classify someone as schizophrenic\nthan manic-depressive.\n\n   During the low points for manic-depressives, extreme fatigue is\ncommon.\n\n   ``There is no desire to get going on anything, which means they\nbecome burdens if they are living with anybody,'' Fieve said.\n``They are not able to earn any money. If you work, you've probably\nlost your job because of excessive absenteeism and poor\nperformance. If you are poor, this is where homelessness sets in.\nYour family can't deal with you. So, you're out on the streets.''\n\n   Ms. Jackson turned to cocaine in an attempt to quiet her demons.\nIt only made things worse, she said. And when the doctors did sort\nout her problems, she said, they had difficulty treating her\nmanic-depression because of her drug addiction.\n\n   Even with the appropriate diagnosis and medication, the\ncomplexities of manic-depression are such that patients live in\ndenial. Sometimes they stop taking their medicine when they start\nto feel better, leaving them open to more intense episodes.\n\n   On this point, and many others, Ms. Jackson's is a case study in\nhow manic-depressives can drift into homelessness and, if their\nproblem is recognized, reclaim their lives.\n\n   The reclamation does not occur overnight, but comes in fits and\nstarts as Ms. Jackson's metamorphosis shows. Though it takes years\nfor some people to get the disease under control, it took her less\nthan a year. She was supervised closely by doctors who were\nexperienced in helping homeless manic-depressives.\n\n   Ms. Jackson allowed a reporter to follow her on the journey,\nwhich lasted about eight months, the length of her stay at a\nhomeless shelter for mentally ill women in lower Manhattan. She\npermitted doctors and social workers to discuss her case with the\nreporter because she wanted her story to help others.\n\n   nn\n\n   The first meeting with Ms. Jackson occurred last June, after her\nthird week at the shelter. Angry and suspicious, she believed she\nhad been misdiagnosed. She wore a billowy denim dress and tried to\nhide behind huge sunglasses and a sun hat.\n\n   She spoke in fragments, but she made two things clear. She\nwanted a home for herself and her 13-year-old son, Timothy, who is\nliving with her father during her recovery. And she was sick, she\nsaid, but not in the head. She had heart palpitations, a headache\nand a sharp pain that charged up and down her left leg.\n\n   During several meetings in June, the signs of depression\nlingered. The headaches, palpitations and leg pain persisted. Once\nstyling spray from her short curly hair dripped into her eyes and\nslid down the sides of her face. She didn't notice. A hallmark of\ndepression is the loss of concern about one's appearance.\n\n   But by July, the transformation was dramatic. The headaches,\nheart palpitations and leg pain had disappeared. Depression can\nsometimes cause unexplained pain, said Dr. David Nardacci, who had\nfirst prescribed a combination of mood stabilizers, antidepressants\nand sleeping pills for her. Later, she was stabilized on a new\ncombination of mood elevators and antidepressants, including\nWellbutrin and Tegretol, and taken off the sleeping pills.\n\n   No longer irritable, she was talkative and energetic. A\ntoothless smile had replaced the vacant stares and the darting\nglances. She wore her short curly hair pinned back.\n\n   She even chatted with a security guard at the front desk of the\nshelter and joked with other residents as she left for an outing.\nOver a dinner of steamy pasta at a trendy downtown restaurant, she\ntalked about reconnecting with her family and living drug-free.\n\n   And she ruminated about how manic-depression can ruin a person's\nlife.\n\n   ``I can't believe I didn't think I had this,'' she said of\nmanic-depression. ``It's so obvious to me now.''\n\n   She was ready, she thought, to go back to work. But her\ncounselors urged her to take one day at a time. She had been fired\nin March 1997 from her clerical job at an insurance office because\nof excessive absenteeism, a symptom of her disease. She talked\nabout wanting to repair her credit, which was ruined years ago by\nwild spending sprees during manic phases.\n\n   ``I'm glad I made this move,'' she said of her entry into the\nshelter system. ``If I had done it sooner, things wouldn't be so\nbad now. I would have been able to save my job. I would have had my\nown house. I could have been in school. I could have had a car and\ncredit cards. I would have been able to save a lot of things.''\n\n   Feeling better than she had in 20 years, Ms. Jackson left the\nshelter last month and moved into assisted housing on Manhattan's\nLower East Side. She signed up to live there for two years, she\nsaid, but she plans to be out in about seven months. She wants to\nbecome an addictions counselor.\n\n   Because new symptoms of anxiety and depression had flared up a\nfew months ago, Nardacci added lithium to Ms. Jackson's daily dose\nof medications. The pills are in part responsible for a 30-pound\nweight gain, but Ms. Jackson was unfazed.\n\n   Dressed in a yellow turtleneck and tweed pants, her hair swept\nup into a beehive, Ms. Jackson was happy yet apprehensive about\nleaving the shelter.\n\n   Her next stop, Los Vecinos on Pitt Street, is geared toward\nmentally ill people with substance abuse problems and offers\ncounseling and psychiatric treatment, among other things.\n\n   The services at Los Vecinos are much like those offered at the\nshelter, but Ms. Jackson has her own room instead of a cubicle. She\nshares a common space with two other women.\n\n   ``I wake up to whatever the plan is for that day,'' she said.\n``I have no baggage from the day before. I can deal with things.\nThat's a big plus. It is so awesome that I can deal with things\nthat used to grip me for days.''\n","Headline":"\nA LINK BETWEEN MENTAL DEPRESSION AND HOMELESSNESS \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ It was spring when J.
