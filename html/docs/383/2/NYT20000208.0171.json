They need medication long before\nthat. They die long before that.''\n\n   About 15 to 20 percent of people with bi-polar disorder, also\nknown as manic depression, commit suicide, according to Susan J.\nBlumenthal, assistant Surgeon General for the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services. Blumenthal, who also spoke at the\nhearing, said the 1 percent of the population diagnosed with the\nmood disorder alternate between a high of racing or grandiose\nthoughts, fast-talking or buying sprees and a low in which they may\nstay in bed, or can't eat or sleep.\n\n   About 30,000 Americans commit suicide every year, the bulk of\nthem older white males, according to the federal Centers for\nDisease Control.\n\n   Blinking back tears, Steel told a Senate Appropriations\nsubcommittee hearing on suicide awareness that her son Nick was\n``brilliant, charming, wonderful, loving, talented, funny,\noutrageous, tormented, unforgettable,'' and suffered from manic\ndepression all his life.\n\n   Steel said she noticed something was wrong when her son was 2\nyears old and was ``like a record playing on the wrong speed, way,\nway too fast.'' She said she sensed there ``were terrible demons\nlurking deep within,'' but doctors and psychiatrists assured her he\nwas fine.\n\n   After Nick's best friend died in a car accident, he began\ndabbling in drugs and alternated between being ``jubilant, loving\nand funny'' and ``too depressed to move.''\n\n   By age 13, Steel said, her son spent time in programs for\nemotionally disturbed kids, but doctors blamed his behavior on a\nhigh IQ. He was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. By age\n15, he was ``curled in a ball, terrified and sick'' and in mental\nhospitals for months, she said.\n\n   At age 16, Steel said her son was diagnosed bi-polar, put on\nlithium medication and became happy again, returning to school to\nearn straight As. He launched a music career as a composer and lead\nsinger of a punk rock band, released nine CDs, toured nationally\nand appeared on MTV.\n\n   Steel said it was when her son decided to stop taking Lithium at\nage 18 that he spiraled into depression and attempted suicide three\ntimes before he took a massive overdose of morphine and died at 19.\n\n   ``I believe he did it because he could not bear to sink to the\ndepths again, and knew he would one day,'' Steel said. ``It was his\nonly way out. His final freedom from pain.''\n\n   Steel, who brought five of her eight children with her to\nCapitol Hill, said later in an interview that she is ``terribly\nshy'' and doesn't usually speak publicly but came forward to honor\nher son.\n\n   She said the stigma that comes with mental illness is an extra\nburden that must be lifted.\n\n   ``It's a shame it's such a dark secret,'' she said. ``We need to\ntreat it like diabetes or any other condition.''\n\n   She offered this advice to parents: ``If you think your child is\nsick, follow it. Trust your heart, get help. It's a fight you\ncannot afford to quit.''\n\n   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who also spoke at the hearing, motioned\ntoward a quilt on the wall commemorating people who have committed\nsuicide, including his father, a coal miner who took his life at\nage 57.\n\n   Reid said there must be a ``massive public awareness'' campaign\nto tell people that suicide ``happens all the time.''\n\n   Reid said the stigma against mental illness prevents people from\nseeking much needed help and said there must be more research to\nfigure out why people kill themselves.\n\n   The hearing was held at Reid's request because he wants more\nfederal money to develop a national anti-suicide strategy.\n\n   Kay Redfield Jamison, a psychologist and professor of psychiatry\nat the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who said she suffered from\nmanic depression and tried to kill herself at age 28, said\nphysicians need to do more, adding that an American commits suicide\nevery 17 minutes.\n\n   ``There is a terrible gap between what we know and what we do\nabout it and this gap is lethal,'' she said.\n\n          \n\n   (Judy Holland can be reached at 202-298-6920 or at the e-mail\naddress judy(at)hearstdc.com)\n","Headline":"\n      NOVELIST DANIELLE STEEL SPEAKS OF SON'S SUICIDE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Best-selling romance novelist Danielle Steel told a\ncongressional panel Tuesday that manic depressive children must be\ndiagnosed and treated to prevent suicides such as that of her son\nNick Traina who took a lethal overdose of morphine two years ago.\n","\n   Steel, a San Francisco mother of nine who has written 77 books,\nincluding ``His Bright Light,'' the story of the life and suicide\nof her 19-year-old son, asked Congress to ``open the eyes'' of the\npublic and of doctors and help erase the stigma of mental illness.\n","\n   Steel said it's not ``good enough to diagnose bi-polars in their\ntwenties, as was the tradition _ they are sick long before that.\nThey need help long before that.
