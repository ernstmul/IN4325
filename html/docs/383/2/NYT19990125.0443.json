MORROW   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Preserving the sales of its top brand, Eli Lilly & Co. announced\non Monday that it had reached a $4 million settlement with three\ndrug companies that were vying to make a generic version of Prozac,\nthe company's popular antidepressant.\n\n   The settlement comes as Lilly's patent infringement lawsuit\nagainst Barr Laboratories; Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of\nNovartis AG, and the Canadian drug maker Apotex Inc. was scheduled\nto begin on Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. Barr,\nwith Apotex as a joint-venture partner, and Geneva ignited a\nthree-year court scuffle with Lilly when they filed applications\nwith the Food and Drug Administration to make a generic form of\nProzac.\n\n   By analyst and investor accounts, Lilly, which is based in\nIndianapolis, was the big winner in the settlement. The agreement\nvirtually guarantees that Prozac will not become generic before\nDecember 2003, when the last of its patents expires, enabling Lilly\nto pocket the drug's $2.8 billion in annual revenue until that\ntime.\n\n   ``What happened is that Lilly made out like a bandit,'' said\nNeil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``In the\nlast two weeks, as the case approached trial, we thought it was 80\npercent sure that Lilly would keep Prozac under patent until\nDecember 2003. Now, we're 95 percent sure. The generic-drug\ncompanies just lost this entire battle.''\n\n   Investors apparently agreed. Shares of Lilly soared $6 on\nMonday, or 7.5 percent, to $86.25. Shares of Barr, which hit a\n52-week high last month at $49.0625, fell $2.75, or 6.3 percent, to\n$40.875.\n\n   Though Lilly executives were pleased with the settlement, the\ncompany's battle with Barr is not over. Last week, Chief Judge\nSarah Evans Barker of U.S. District Court threw out what analysts\nhad thought were Barr's two chief complaints _ that Lilly held two\npatents on the same drug and that the company had not disclosed the\nbest way to make the compound.\n\n   With the settlement, Barr can immediately appeal the decisions\non those two claims, thus keeping its case against Lilly alive.\nAnalysts said on Monday that Barr's desire to appeal those claims\nkept the settlement amount at only $4 million, about what Lilly\nwould have paid to try the case, instead of a larger sum that would\nhave prevented any further court action.\n\n   ``We were running out of time on the patent that expired in\n2001,'' said Bruce L. Downey, chief executive of Barr Laboratories,\nin Pomona, N.Y. ``If we had litigated the case, we would have not\ngotten a decision until April or May. This way, we can proceed with\nthe appeals, which is where I have believed this issue would be\ndecided anyway.''\n\n   Even though Barr has another day in court, the settlement is a\nvictory for Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive. It is common\nfor the bosses of large pharmaceutical companies to face patent\nexpirations, which inevitably drain sales, but Taurel appears to\nhave handled Prozac's demise with finesse.\n\n   Last fall, several analysts had publicly chided Taurel as being\nshortsighted regarding Prozac's patent expiration, but he now has\nseveral remedies to deploy.\n\n   Lilly agreed last month to buy rights to the improved version of\nProzac made by Sepracor Inc.; that compound is patented until 2015.\nOn Monday, Taurel named several drugs under development _ including\na combination of Prozac and Zyprexa, Lilly's antipsychotic drug _\nthat would lift the company's revenue once Prozac became a generic.\n\n   ``We have said all along that we have a multipronged approach to\nthe Prozac expiration,'' Taurel said. ``The settlement only\nvindicates our position, but we plan to capitalize on our expertise\nwith depression.''\n\n   Still, Taurel has not heard the last from Downey, who spent 20\nyears as a trial lawyer before joining Barr. Determined to get a\ncut of Prozac's revenues, Downey said last week that he was\nstudying the patent on Sepracor's improved Prozac compound for a\npossible challenge in court.\n\n   Taurel does not appear to be worried. ``We think that Sepracor's\npatent on the molecule is strong,'' he said. ``If it wasn't, we\nwould have challenged it ourselves.''\n","Headline":"\nLILLY AND 3 RIVALS TO SETTLE PROZAC SUIT FOR $4 MILLION \n","Text":["\n   Preserving the sales of its top brand, Eli Lilly & Co. announced\non Monday that it had reached a $4 million settlement with three\ndrug companies that were vying to make a generic version of Prozac,\nthe company's popular antidepressant.\n","\n   The settlement comes as Lilly's patent infringement lawsuit\nagainst Barr Laboratories; Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of\nNovartis AG, and the Canadian drug maker Apotex Inc. was scheduled\nto begin on Monday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis.
