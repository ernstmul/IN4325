Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a major effort on\nMonday to reverse a sharp increase in the number of preschool\nchildren using Ritalin, Prozac and other powerful psychiatric\ndrugs, administration officials said Sunday.\n\n   As part of the initiative, they said, the government will inform\nparents and teachers about the risks of such drugs, the Food and\nDrug Administration will develop new drug labels, the National\nInstitutes of Health will begin a huge nationwide study of Ritalin\nuse in children under the age of 6, and the White House will hold a\nconference this fall on the diagnosis and treatment of mental\nillness in very young children.\n\n   Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal health officials plan to meet\non Monday with parents, psychiatrists, pediatricians,\npsychologists, nurses and social workers to discuss the issue.\n\n   Then the administration plans to issue a statement declaring\nthat ``the use of medication is not generally the first option for\na preschool child with a psychiatric disorder.''\n\n   In a study last month in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, researchers reported that there had apparently been a\nsharp increase in the number of preschoolers taking psychotropic\ndrugs, particularly stimulants like Ritalin and antidepressants\nlike Prozac. Ritalin is called a stimulant because it belongs to a\nfamily of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and\nincrease a person's alertness and ability to pay attention.\nResearchers say that 20 percent of white boys are taking the drug\nin some suburban school districts.\n\n   The study caused concern among parents and medical experts\nalike, and the administration is now trying to address that\nconcern.\n\n   In an interview, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National\nInstitute of Mental Health, said, ``As a rule of thumb, doctors,\npsychologists and social workers should attempt to modify the\nbehavior of a child and deal with family crises before drugs are\nprescribed.''\n\n   The government has prepared a new guide for parents on the\ntreatment of young children with mental disorders. ``When\nmedication is used, it should not be the only strategy,'' but\nshould be part of an overall treatment plan, the guide says.\nParents and doctors may want to consider behavioral therapy for the\nchild, family therapy and other techniques to help manage the\nchild's symptoms, the document says.\n\n   Administration officials said the initiative was inspired mainly\nby Hillary Rodham Clinton, who they said wanted to announce some\nimmediate steps after seeing the immense public concern about the\nuse of powerful pills to treat toddlers with emotional and\nbehavioral disorders.\n\n   Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate in New York, but White\nHouse officials said it would be cynical to believe that her\nmotives were only political. They noted that for years she has been\ninterested in children's issues, including the testing and labeling\nof drugs for children. Health officials and medical experts said\nthe government's concern was well founded.\n\n   ``Everything Mrs. Clinton does is related to her campaign, but\nthis initiative has substance too,'' a federal health official\nsaid. ``We want doctors and parents to think about these issues.''\n\n   In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation last month, Dr. Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of the\npsychiatry department at Harvard Medical School, said that children\nwith behavioral disorders were ``increasingly subjected to quick\nand inexpensive pharmacologic fixes,'' even though ``there is no\nempirical evidence to support psychotropic drug treatment in very\nyoung children.''\n\n   Indeed, Ritalin carries a warning that says, ``Ritalin should\nnot be used in children under 6 years, since safety and efficacy in\nthis age group have not been established.''\n\n   Hyman said that the National Institute of Mental Health would\nspend $6 million in the next five years to study whether Ritalin\nwas safe and effective in treating preschoolers with the impulsive,\naggressive behavior traits known as attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder _ the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in\nchildren.\n\n   In the study, Hyman said, hundreds of girls and boys at research\ncenters around the country will receive Ritalin, behavior therapy\nor some combination of the two.\n\n   Hyman said that the problem was not simply that children were\nbeing overmedicated, but that they were not being appropriately\nevaluated and treated. ``In some communities,'' he said, ``too few\nchildren are receiving medications, just as in other communities,\ntoo many are getting medications.''\n\n   Government scientists said that they recognized that drug\ntherapy could sometimes provide relief to young children. ``If a\nkid is engaged in aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, head\nbanging, and is otherwise uncontrollable, you should try\nmedication,'' Hyman said.\n\n   Certain drugs are widely prescribed for young children even\nthough they have not been studied, approved or labeled for such\nuse. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine; after a\ndrug is approved for one purpose, doctors often prescribe it for\nother purposes.\n\n   The White House said, for example, that some medications used to\ntreat depression and anxiety disorders in children, like Paxil,\nProzac and Wellbutrin, were not labeled for pediatric use.\n\n   In addition, the White House said, Zoloft has been approved to\ntreat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 6 and older, while\nLuvox has been approved for the same condition in children 8 and\nolder.
