Times News Service   \n\n   From a 1996 drug advertisement in The Journal of Clinical\nPsychiatry:\n\n   ``A great day for Dad. A great day for Mom. A terrific day for\nthe family. Make it happen. The Zoloft Saturday.''  \n\n   For any of the estimated one in 10 Americans who have been\nexposed to Prozac or the other, similar prescription medicines\ndiscussed in his blistering new book, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen offers\nsomething none too welcome: reason to be anxious and depressed.\nEven for anyone determined never to read anything with ``Prozac''\nin its title, he presents an important, deeply troubling\nexamination of the means by which these drugs have become so widely\ndisseminated, and the possible long-term toll they may take.\n\n   In a book that ensures he will never be the guest of honor at a\npharmaceutical convention, Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in\npsychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a practicing psychiatrist,\noffers a wide-ranging and well-researched indictment. He begins by\ninvoking the track record of Thorazine, the tranquilizer that was\ngreeted as a psychological panacea in the 1950s, later produced\nneurological side effects in 40 percent of patients and was not\nburdened with an FDA warning label until 1985. What if Prozac and\nother, similar drugs that have begun to be linked with the same\nsymptoms had a comparable effect?\n\n   In a book as readable as it is alarming, Glenmullen crystallizes\nthe evidence that these drugs, selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors (or SSRIs), by manipulating the influx of serotonin in\nthe brain, can create a ``backlash'' by affecting the levels of\nother chemicals, notably dopamine. He shows how that process can\nyield such Thorazine-associated fallout as facial tics, memory loss\nand body-stiffening parkinsonism. ``The unfortunate irony is that\ndrugs heavily promoted as correcting unproven biochemical\nimbalances may be, in fact, causing imbalances and brain damage,''\nhe asserts. ``Will silent damage caused by a serotonin booster\naccelerate the aging process and make some people more prone to\ndevelop neurological symptoms later in life?''\n\n   It can and will be argued that such problems are rare and that\nthe much-vaunted uplifting effects of these drugs are more\nsignificant than their potential detriments. Even so, ``Prozac\nBacklash'' makes a tough, persuasive case that the drugs are more\ndangerous than generally acknowledged, that patients and doctors\nare insufficiently informed about the risks and that drug companies\ndevote vast amounts of money and energy to spin control.\n\n   ``When discussing brain cell damage caused by street drugs such\nas amphetamines, cocaine or Ecstasy, researchers speak in the\ngravest terms, warning of dread effects,'' writes Glenmullen, who\npresents abundant evidence of how so-called independent researchers\nmay prove to be on drug company payrolls. ``Only when referring to\nprescription drugs do they suggest that pruning nerve cells might\nbe `therapeutic.'''\n\n   The book spends much time on the important role of euphemism in\nProzac's public relations. For instance, Glenmullen offers a\nlengthy discussion of the difficulty patients may experience in\ntrying to wean themselves from these drugs, even if Eli Lilly, the\ncompany that manufactures Prozac, has run ads reading: ``Like other\nantidepressants, it isn't habit-forming.''\n\n   Along the way he mentions a 1996 symposium that Eli Lilly\nsponsored to discuss this problem, and notes that one upshot of the\nmeeting was a change in terminology, so that no one need use the\nword withdrawal. ``The sanitized term `antidepressant\ndiscontinuation syndrome' is the kind of well-funded obfuscation\ndoctors and patients frequently face when trying to get honest,\nreliable information on these powerful drugs,'' he writes.\n\n   In the realm of euphemism, Glenmullen explains how Prozac can\nclaim that only 2 to 5 percent of users experience sexual\ndysfunction, although other evidence places that number as high as\n60 percent. The team that did the original research on the drug\nsimply never raised the issue. He also shows how SSRI-related\nanxiety and jitters were minimized for this research by ignoring\nthe fact that many of the patients studied were also taking\nsedatives to control those symptoms.\n\n   An especially disturbing section of the book delves into a\nlawsuit brought against Eli Lilly by survivors of a rampage by\nJoseph Wesbecker, who was the company's worst nightmare: a Prozac\nuser who went on the rampage in 1989 with an AK-47. Fortunately for\nEli Lilly, the 1994 trial was concurrent with the O.J. Simpson\ntrial, the facts were carefully manipulated, a secret settlement\nwas made between plaintiffs and the drug company even as the trial\ncontinued, and Prozac avoided a warning label about possibly\nviolent or suicidal behavior. All the particulars of this\nremarkable legal travesty are laid out here.\n\n   Like much else in ``Prozac Backlash,'' the facts of the\nWesbecker trial are mostly available elsewhere. But the book's data\ncome from a great array of diverse sources, and Glenmullen has done\na prodigious job of assembling and illuminating it here. He argues\ncogently and persuasively for better research, truly independent\nresearch data, consumer skepticism about such drug\ncompany-generated phenomena as ``National Depression Awareness\nDay'' and less readiness on the part of doctors, whose patients may\nsee them only seldom because of insurance constraints, to hand out\nantidepressants as an easy fix-it without follow-up visits or\ncloser attention.\n\n   As a psychiatrist, Glenmullen shows a sharp bias for the\nbenefits of therapy over psychopharmacology, and it is here that\n``Prozac Backlash'' is weak. When he offers case studies from his\nown practice, model patients seem to respond magically to the\ndoctor's Sherlock Holmesian acuity in pinpointing their problems.\n(``Do express elevators symbolize the fast track, which you have\nmixed feelings about?'' he asks a phobic executive, whose fear\nforces him to walk up to and down from a 43rd-floor office.)\n\n   But a lengthy section of the book discusses herbal substitutes\nfor antidepressants, the importance of diet and exercise, 12-step\ngroups, friends, family and community as important in overcoming\ndepression. These things can work, he says _ even if as much money\nis spent in the United States on promoting wonder drugs to doctors\nthan on all medical schooling and residency training combined.  \n\n   PUBLICATION NOTES:\n\n   `PROZAC BACKLASH'\n\n   Overcoming the Dangers of Prozac Zoloft, Paxil and Other\nAntidepressants With Safe, Effective Alternatives\n\n   By Joseph Glenmullen, M.D.\n\n   383 pages.
