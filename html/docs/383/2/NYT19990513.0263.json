HOWE  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Fish oil pills may help remedy symptoms of bipolar disorder,\nsometimes called manic depression, according to a new study by\nresearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and McLean\nHospital in Belmont, Mass.\n\n   ``Our study results indicate fish oil does possess elements to\nstabilize mood,'' said lead author Dr. Andrew Stoll, a psychiatrist\non the staff of both hospitals. Fish oil appears to boost serotonin\nlevels in the brain, stabilizing mood in a way similar to drugs\nsuch as Prozac or Zoloft, the researchers said.\n\n   In a four-month study, 30 outpatients at the Brigham who have\nbipolar disorder got pills containing omega-3 fatty acids, which\nare abundant in fish oils as well as in canola and flaxseed oil, or\nplacebo pills with olive oil, while also receiving their regular\ntreatments or therapies.\n\n   Nine of 14 patients getting fish oil derived from menhaden, or\n64 percent, reported relief of their symptoms, compared to only 3\nof 16 taking placebos, or 19 percent. The results are in the\ncurrent Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American\nMedical Association.\n\n   Many other health benefits have already been identified for\nomega-3 fatty acids, including relieving symptoms of arthritis and\nheart disease, reducing women's risk of breast cancer, and\npreventing the intestinal ailment known as Crohn's disease.\n\n   If further research bears out the effects, researchers said,\nfish oil might be prescribed as a supplement to antidepressant\ndrugs or lithium for people with bipolar disorder. Omega-3 fatty\nacids could also be shown to have a role treating depression,\nschizophrenia, or attention deficit disorder, Stoll said.\n\n   But because pharmaceutical companies cannot patent fish oils,\ngovernment agencies or foundations will probably need to fund\nfurther tests, Stoll and colleague Dr. Lauren B. Marangell added.\n","Headline":"\nFISH OIL MAY HELP CONTROL BIPOLAR DISORDER \n","Text":["\n   Fish oil pills may help remedy symptoms of bipolar disorder,\nsometimes called manic depression, according to a new study by\nresearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and McLean\nHospital in Belmont, Mass.\n","\n   ``Our study results indicate fish oil does possess elements to\nstabilize mood,'' said lead author Dr. Andrew Stoll, a psychiatrist\non the staff of both hospitals.
