{"DocumentId":"NYT19981118.0168","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-SPCL-MENTAL-RESEARCH-II-3RD \n   TAKE-BOS  \n UNDATED: ... its description.  \n \n\n   ``I understand that my condition may improve, worsen, or remain\nunchanged from participation in this study.'' A later sentence\nadded that ``I understand that because of the withdrawal of active\nmedication, I may become worse during this study and that either a\nrelapse of my initial symptoms or new symptoms may occur.''\n\n   But UCLA officials painted a less uncertain picture in court\ndepositions and the published literature. They cited earlier\nstudies showing that 60 to 75 percent of schizophrenic patients\ntaken off medication experienced a relapse. They said medication is\nwithdrawn in order to study factors that can predict which patients\nmight relapse and which ones might be able to safely stay off drugs\nknown to cause troublesome side effects.\n\n   In a revealing admission, the official who headed UCLA's human\nsubject protection board at the time of the study said in a\ndeposition that such details as relapse rates were kept out of\nconsent forms because they were ``overly frightening.''\n\n   The official, Dr. Dorothy Rosenthal, was asked by Aller's\nattorney if such information would deter patients from entering\nsuch experiments.\n\n   ``Correct,'' she responded.\n\n   Looking back on his experience, Aller, now 35, said he had no\nidea researchers expected to see him get worse. ``I thought they\ncared about me,'' he said.\n\n   As his parents, Robert and Gloria, saw their son descend into\npsychosis, they began to ask for his medical records and sought to\ndetermine the true purpose of the study.\n\n   When his parents finally convinced him the researchers did not\nhave his interests at heart, said Aller, ``I couldn't believe they\nwanted relapse.'' He left the study in 1991 and is doing well on a\nnew schizophrenia medication.\n\n   Antonio LaMadrid thought the UCLA researchers cared about him\ntoo, especially when they provided weekly lunches, holiday parties,\nand free care as part of the package, recalled his brother,\nLaurence LaMadrid.\n\n   ``There was a huge social component,'' said Laurence, who stayed\nin contact with his brother during his time in the study. ``It was\nalmost a fraternity.''\n\n   When researchers told Antonio he was being transferred from the\nAftercare Clinic after several years, citing drug use, he was\ndevastated, Laurence recalled. Soon afterward, Antonio committed\nsuicide by jumping off a 12-story UCLA building.\n\n   Although Antonio's participation in the withdrawal phase of the\nstudy had ended about three years earlier, he had continued to be a\npatient at the clinic. But court depositions in the lawsuit filed\nby the LaMadrid and Aller families against UCLA show that he had\nnot been seen by a physician in his last year at the clinic.\n\n   UCLA spokesman Warren Robak said he could not comment on either\ncase because the families have not given written permission waiving\npatient confidentiality.\n\n   Keith H. Nuechterlein, the UCLA clinical psychologist who headed\nup the study, said that while the consent form did not specify\nrelapse rates, such information was raised in conversations with\npatients and family members.\n\n   ``I really feel that the amount of information that was\navailable _ when considering the oral and written informed consent\n_ was always very complete,'' said Nuechterlein. The study,\ndesigned to better understand the early stages of schizophrenia,\ncontinues to be federally funded, although the\nmedication-withdrawal phase ended several years ago.\n\n   In May 1994, OPRR found that UCLA had failed to fully disclose\nthe risk of medication withdrawal in the schizophrenia study; UCLA\nchanged its consent form in response. OPRR also concluded that even\nthough UCLA said it provided much of the information orally, that\n``cannot take the place of the written informed consent which ...\nregulations require prior to participation in such research.''\n\n   Nuechterlein said he expects the standards for informed consent\nto continue to evolve, ``as we try to understand how to really make\nsure our patients in studies, and their family members, truly\nunderstand, and are making good, sensible decisions.''\n\n   A Globe review of symptom-exacerbation studies from institutions\naround the country found a pattern similar to that at UCLA:\nresearchers telling patients one thing in consent forms and\nplanning to do another.\n\n   At the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, for instance,\nresearchers gave schizophrenic patients the drug L-dopa, used to\ntreat Parkinson's disease but known to induce psychotic symptoms in\npeople with mental illness. But researchers told patients that ``we\nthink by giving you this drug and evaluating your response to it,\nwe may be able to tell if your regular medication is safe for\nyou.''\n\n   In their 1987 published report, the researchers noted that while\nmost patients recovered from psychotic symptoms after the L-dopa\nwas stopped, ``a few patients did not.... It seems likely that\nL-dopa played a role in bringing on relapse in these few patients\nor caused some form of sensitization to psychosis.''\n\n   Researchers at the Bronx VA acknowledged in a 1994 letter to\nmental health advocate Vera Sharav that at the time of the 1987\nstudy it was standard practice not to spell out the risks in\nconsent forms. They said if the study were still going on today,\nthe consent form would be worded more explicitly.\n\n   At University Hospital in Cincinnati, where in 1983 Shalmah\nPrince sought treatment for an impending manic phase of her manic\ndepression, she was shepherded into a study involving medication\nwithdrawal and an injection of apomorphine, but the consent form\nnever disclosed all the risks.\n\n   In a court deposition in the lawsuit that Prince eventually\nfiled, which was dismissed last year because the statute of\nlimitations ran out, one of the researchers, Dr. David Garver,\nexplained the failure to disclose risk this way:\n\n   ``It is true that the consent form signed by the plaintiff does\nnot discuss a risk associated with a drug-free period. However,\nthis risk would seem to be self-evident even to a person without\nmedical training. If therapeutic drugs are of benefit to control a\npatient's disease or disorder, it should be clear that withholding\nsuch treatment may lead to a worsening of the patient's symptoms\nuntil treatment is reinitiated.''\n\n   Researchers say that the omission or minimizing of risk in\nconsent forms during the 1980s was in keeping with standards of the\nday and that procedures have vastly improved. But more recent\nexamples of questionable consent still exist.\n\n   In its 1994 and 1995 review of 125 contemporary studies, some\ninvolving the mentally ill and some not, the President's Advisory\nCommittee on Human Radiation Experiments found that nearly half of\nall consent forms were ethically unacceptable or questionable, for\nfailing to disclose risks or other reasons.\n\n   In its continuing investigation of the University of Maryland,\nOPRR found inadequate disclosure of research risks in studies\ncontinuing into the 1990s.\n\n   An example of lack of candor on the part of researchers doing\nchallenge studies comes from consent forms in which psychotic\nsymptoms are described as a side effect rather than the aim of the\nresearch.\n\n   ``The symptoms are expected. They are not unintended side\neffects,'' said Donald Rosenstein, a specialist on psychiatric\nresearch at the National Institute of Mental Health, testifying\nbefore the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.\n\n   ``I think a lot of people, including investigators, can get\nconfused about that,'' Rosenstein said. ``In symptom-provoking\nstudies, the whole point is to elicit symptoms that are\ncharacteristic of the condition under study.''\n\n     \n   \n`I don't remember\n\n   what I signed'\n\n     \n  \n\n   Even in psychiatric studies that don't provoke symptoms,\nhowever, true informed consent can be elusive.\n\n   When Andrew Brownstein entered a National Institute of Mental\nHealth program in Washington, D.C., in 1994, he was asked to sign a\nsheaf of consent forms at a single sitting without having time to\nread them. Some were for studies of potentially therapeutic drugs,\nbut others were for spinal taps and brain scans that would do\nnothing to improve his condition.\n\n        In the case of Brownstein, as in others, the sheer volume of\nmaterial raises the question: Could he possibly know and understand\nwhat he was agreeing to?\n\n   ``It was a big, big black notebook,'' said Brownstein, who has\nbipolar disorder, in recalling what a researcher gave him the first\nnight he was on the ward. ``There were so many consent forms\npresented to me I don't remember what I signed.''\n\n   In the 13 months he was there until he left in 1995, Brownstein\nunderwent seven spinal taps, including one that was so\nexcruciatingly painful that he suffered a severe headache for\nseveral days. He was also enrolled in studies of experimental\nmedications that might be therapeutic.\n\n   ``It was awful,'' he said of the headache. ``I think it knocked\nme down for four or five days.''\n\n   In an investigation prompted by Brownstein's testimony to the\nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission last year and concluded in\nSeptember, OPRR validated Brownstein's complaints. In response, the\nNational Institute of Mental Health changed its informed-consent\nprocess.\n\n        Dr. Trey Sunderland, chairman of NIMH's institutional review\nboard, which is charged with protecting subjects of research, said,\n``We are constantly trying to improve informed consent.'' He\nacknowledged it was ``an error'' to ask Brownstein or any other\npatient to sign consents for multiple protocols at once.\n\n   ``We have spent a year and a half now, changing our policies\nand, I think, making them better,'' Sunderland said. But he added\nthat NIMH's review board is ``not a policing organization. We're a\nsupervisory organization. We've tried to make it absolutely clear\nto our investigators what we expect and what OPRR expects.''\n\n   But for Brownstein, the consent process was part of an\nexperience that made him feel like a guinea pig, rather than\nsomeone in need of care.\n\n   As he was about to be discharged, a doctor said ```Andy holds\nthe record. We have done more procedures on him in 13 months than\nwe have done on people here a much longer time. His veins were\ngood, his arteries were good, his spine was good,''' Brownstein\nrecalled. ``That didn't make me feel proud at all. I wasn't trying\nto set any records.''\n\n   The final insult came the next day, as Brownstein left the\nfacility. He recalled the doctor saying to him, ``Thanks for your\ntime, and thanks for your body fluids.''\n\n   ``That sums it up,'' said Brownstein. ``It was very cold.''\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   ``I understand that my condition may improve, worsen, or remain\nunchanged from participation in this study.''
