Times News Service   \n\n   Pharmaceuticals are a risky, but lucrative, business. Drug\ncompanies turn scientific advances into life-saving medicines that\ncan generate millions of dollars in sales each day, but the process\ntakes time _ an average of 12 to 15 years _ and money.\n\n   Through a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, the\nprescription drug industry is increasingly global. But the\ncompanies earn most of their profits, and do most of their basic\nresearch, in the United States, the last drug market free of price\nrestraints. The industry consistently ranks as the most profitable\namong Fortune 500 companies.\n\n   In this election year, with prescription drugs now the\nfastest-growing component of the United States' health-care bill,\nthe political debate is centered on how to help elderly people pay\nfor their medications. So politicians and consumers are taking a\nclose look at the drug industry, a business that closely guards its\nfinancial and scientific secrets.\n\n   Drug Discovery\n\n   Pharmaceutical companies spend over $20 billion annually on\nresearch and development, a figure that has nearly doubled every\nfive years since 1970, according to industry data. The industry\nestimates that the average cost of developing a successful drug is\nover $500 million.\n\n   The actual cost of developing a particular medicine _ the\nlaboratory equipment, the raw materials, the researchers' salaries,\nthe clinical trials _ is just a small percentage of the $500\nmillion. The rest is the cost of lost opportunity: years and\ndollars spent on scientific leads that prove fruitless, and\nresearch money that could have generated interest had it been\ninvested elsewhere.\n\n   The $500 million figure is extrapolated from a 1991 study by\nresearchers at Tufts University. Some experts say the estimate,\ndrawn from confidential industry data not subject to outside\nreview, is inflated.\n\n   Companies spend more on drug development _ the D in R&D _ than\nthey do on research. While clinical trials account for the biggest\ndevelopment expense, experts say that some development costs, like\nconsulting fees paid to doctors, are more appropriately categorized\nas marketing than as research.\n\n   Clinical Testing\n\n   For every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds that the industry screens as\npotential new medicines, 250 make it to the stage of testing in\nanimals. Of these, the industry says, five enter testing in people,\nin clinical trials.\n\n   The trials have three phases. First, the drug is given to a\nsmall number of healthy volunteers to test its safety and establish\nthe proper dose. The second trial tests for effectiveness and looks\nfor side effects in a larger number of patients who have the\ncondition that the drug is meant to treat.\n\n   The costliest clinical trial is the phase 3 study, in which\nthousands of patients may be tested, so that scientists can assess\nthe drug in a diverse population, over an extended period.\nDepending on the drug and the amount of medical care involved,\nexperts say, a phase 3 clinical trial can cost $10,000 to $20,000 a\npatient.\n\n   The Regulators\n\n   For years the drug makers complained that the Food and Drug\nAdministration, the federal agency that regulates medication, took\ntoo long to approve new treatments, eating into the valuable life\nof a patent. That changed in 1992 when Congress passed the\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled the agency to speed\ndrug reviews with the help of industry money.\n\n   Between 1992 and 1997, the industry paid the agency $327 million\nto hire 600 new reviewers. Today, the average drug approval time\nhas dropped to 12 months, from about 30 months before the law was\npassed. And the number of new medicines the agency approves each\nyear is rising.\n\n   But critics say that in relying on drug companies to supplement\nits budget, the FDA has become too close to the industry. They\npoint to a rash of drugs withdrawn in recent years after serious\nside effects surfaced once the drugs were in pharmacies.\n\n   Patenting\n\n   Patents, as much as science, are critical to the success of a\nnew drug. A patent is a property right. It confers a\ngovernment-authorized monopoly for a set period _ in the United\nStates, 20 years from the date the application is filed. During\nthis period of market exclusivity, the patent owner can recover the\ncosts of the original investment.\n\n   Patents were not always of paramount importance in medical\nresearch; many academic scientists once believed that knowledge\nshould not be treated as proprietary. After Jonas Salk invented a\npolio vaccine, the journalist Edward R. Murrow asked him who owned\nthe patent. ``There is no patent,'' Salk replied. ``Could you\npatent the sun?''\n\n   And when a Rutgers University professor, Selman Waksman,\ninvented a breakthrough antibiotic, streptomycin, in the 1940s, he\npatented the drug but gave away the rights. The result: Many\ncompanies sold streptomycin, keeping prices _ and profits _ low.\n\n   The picture is far different today. Drug companies often derive\nthe bulk of their sales from a handful of top-selling medications,\nso the pressure to invent the next blockbuster, and maximize its\ntime under patent, is intense. In the industry, this is known as\n``life-cycle protection''; one way the drug makers protect their\nproducts is simply to file more patents.\n\n   The FDA keeps a registry of all drug patents. But the agency\ndoes not evaluate whether the patents are valid; it simply takes\nthe company's word. So the listing creates a barrier to rivals,\nwhich often wind up challenging patents in court.\n\n   Drug companies have also fought hard to win patent extensions.\nIn 1995, an international trade agreement pushed back the\nexpiration date of patents. Several companies benefited handsomely\nfrom a loophole in that extension.\n\n   While drug makers say they need longer patent protection to\ngenerate profits for research, some experts say that patent\nexpirations, not extensions, spur innovation. Eli Lilly & Co., for\ninstance, is pursuing new anti-depressants now that the patent on\nits best seller, Prozac, is about to run out.\n\n   ``The Prozac patent expiration,'' the company's 1998 annual\nreport said, ``is serving as a catalyst to bring greater intensity\nto everything we do.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Generic Competition\n\n   Prozac is not the only blockbuster drug threatened by the loss\nof its patent. In the next five years patents are due to expire on\nsome of the most lucrative drugs in the history of medicine, among\nthem Prilosec, the ulcer medication; Claritin, for allergies; and\nZocor, for high cholesterol.\n\n   Generics can erode a brand drug's market share within months. A\n1999 report by Boston Consulting Group, which advises the industry,\npredicted that the average top drug company would lose 30 percent\nof its sales to generics by 2003.\n\n   If the threat of generics creates angst on Wall Street about the\nindustry's profitability, it creates even more inside the\ncompanies, where scientists, patent lawyers and business executives\nare taking a variety of steps to beat back competition.\n\n   When a drug produced by a joint venture of Dupont and Merck, the\nblood thinner Coumadin, faced a generic challenge, the companies\nhired a battery of lobbyists to press state legislators and\npharmacy boards to adopt rules that, in effect, restricted the\nability of pharmacists to substitute the generic for the brand\ndrug.\n\n   Claritin's maker, Schering-Plough, has taken its lobbying\nefforts to Washington; it has asked Congress to insert a provision\ninto a spending bill that would extend the drug's patent.\n\n   When generic makers tried to sell a version of Taxol, a leading\nbreast-cancer drug, Taxol's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, sued for\npatent infringement _ not on the drug, but on the method of\ndelivery, which the company had also patented. Courts in Britain\nand the United States found for the generics earlier this year, but\nthe case is on appeal and there is still no generic on the market.\n\n   Fewer than 20 percent of all prescriptions were filled with\ngeneric drugs in 1984. That year Congress passed a landmark law,\nthe Hatch-Waxman Act, intended to facilitate generic competition.\nBy 1996 generics had captured 43 percent of the market and were\nsaving consumers $8 billion to $10 billion annually, according to a\nstudy by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n   But because generics cost much less than brand drugs, they\naccount for only a small fraction of the industry's total sales.\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the combined\nprescription sales of the top 20 generic-drug makers in 1998\ntotaled $7 billion, less than a tenth of those of the top 20 brand\ncompanies.\n\n   Going to Market\n\n   The United States is the last free market for pharmaceuticals:\nOther developed nations control drug prices, as in Japan, Canada,\nand France, or drug company profits, as in England. So Americans\ntypically pay higher prices for new medications than people\nanywhere else in the developed world.\n\n   How the drug companies set prices, though, remains something of\na mystery; they do not discuss their pricing strategies. The drug\nmakers say price is dictated by the high cost of research. But the\ncalculus behind any single pricing decision is complex, and largely\nshaped by market forces.\n\n   Does the new drug offer therapeutic advantages over existing\nmedicines? How big is the patient population? Is there generic\ncompetition? Paradoxically, the arrival of generic competition\noften results in raised prices for the brand-name counterparts, as\ncompanies seek to maximize revenue in a shrinking market.\n\n   And despite the industry's emphasis on R&D costs, the top drug\nmakers in 1998 spent, as a percentage of sales, three times as much\non marketing and general and administrative expenses as they did on\nresearch and development, the Kaiser Family Foundation said.\n\n   There is no set price for a single drug in the United States:\nHealth plans, the government and individual patients all pay\ndifferent rates, depending on their power in the marketplace. More\nthan three-quarters of Americans younger than 65 have prescription\ndrug coverage; their insurers typically negotiate discounts. But\nthe size of those discounts is kept secret.\n\n   Among elderly Americans, who account for 13 percent of the\npopulation but roughly one-third of all drug expenditures, it is a\ndifferent story. One-third of the nation's senior citizens lack\ndrug insurance and must pay out of pocket for their pills. As a\nresult, they typically pay the highest prices.\n","Headline":"\nINVENTION OF DRUG IS FIRST OF MANY STEPS \n","Text":["\n   Pharmaceuticals are a risky, but lucrative, business.
