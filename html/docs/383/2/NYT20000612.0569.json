(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   This is a story about a drug that changed the world, the bravery\nof rats, the evolution of a psychiatrist, the Jekyll and Hyde\nnature of man-made chemicals, the Church of Scientology, and the\nimpulses that lead some people to kill.\n\n   It is also about money. Lots of money.\n\n   The drug is Prozac, and its resume is lore: Introduced by Eli\nLilly and Co. in 1988 as the first notable new antidepressant in\ntwo decades, it lifted the spirits of millions and became shorthand\nfor the search for answers in convenient pill form.\n\n   Yet its triumphs have been clouded by persistent accusations,\ndenied by Lilly, that a small but significant percentage of Prozac\nusers suffer a side effect that runs counter to the drug's intent:\nintense agitation that in rare cases explodes into violence,\nsuicide, or both.\n\n   Now, as the familiar green-and-white pill approaches the\nhumbling status of a generic drug in 2004, along comes a new drug\nderived from Prozac _ ostensibly without the dangerous side effects\n_ that is designed to take Prozac's place in the medicine cabinet\nand on Lilly's billion-dollar balance sheet.\n\n   And along with that new drug comes a most unexpected helpmate\nfor Lilly, a Harvard psychiatrist named Martin H. Teicher, who in\nthe space of a decade has taken an extraordinary journey.\n\n   From Prozac's most prominent critic _ author of the first\nscientific paper to wave the red flag of suicide and violence _\nTeicher is now enjoying what he calls his ``wonderfully ironic''\nrole as co-inventor of the Prozac replacement drug.\n\n   With a high-flying Massachusetts drug firm acting as middleman,\nTeicher stands to grow rich from Lilly, despite its continued\nrejection of his conclusions about suicide. If the new Prozac\nclears ongoing trials and proves even moderately successful\ncompared to its predecessor, Teicher could supplement his associate\nprofessor's salary by more than $5 million a year.\n\n   At the same time, Teicher's decade-old observations about\nProzac's dangers have resurfaced in a very awkward way for Lilly.\nThe drug patent obtained by Teicher and his co-inventors says the\nnew Prozac is free from the suicide side effect, and last week that\nclaim became the basis for a federal fraud lawsuit against Lilly.\nThe lawsuit essentially accuses Lilly of denying any Prozac-suicide\nlink on the one hand, yet buying an exclusive license for a patent\nthat says otherwise.\n\n   For perspective, imagine that car-safety crusader Ralph Nader\nidentifies a major safety flaw in, say, the braking system used in\nall cars. The automakers deny that the flaw exists. Nader then\ninvents a device that fixes the flaw and offers it to the\nautomakers. Despite denying the problem, they pay him millions for\nit.\n\n   Now substitute Teicher and Lilly in those roles, and that's what\nmakes this a uniquely American tale about the pursuit of knowledge,\nthe pursuit of profits, and the arranged marriages that sometimes\nbring them together.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Teicher's office at the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital in\nBelmont, Mass. has all the trappings of a psychiatrist's den. There\nis the leather couch, the bursting bookcase, and the wall of\ndiplomas _ PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1977, MD four years later from\nYale University. A clock chimes to mark the passing hours.\n\n   There are personal touches, too: a jar on a shelf jokingly\nlabeled ``Ashes of former students''; and a quote on the wall from\nVoltaire, ``No problem can withstand the assault of sustained\nthinking.'' A plaque commemorating one of Teicher's two\nProzac-related patents hangs over his desk. There are two\npaintings, one of a sad clown and the other of a frightened child.\nThey were painted by the psychiatrist's mother.\n\n   Teicher, 49, is a suit-and-tie native of New York's endless\nsuburb, Long Island. Divorced, he lives in Waltham, Mass.; after\nthe divorce, his ex-wife took a job as a cancer researcher for none\nother than Lilly, which Teicher calls ``an odd happenstance of\ncoincidence.''\n\n   He does not seek publicity; would-be interviewers have to run a\ngantlet of McLean public relations officials. Once he agrees to\ntalk, however, Teicher is gracious, if seemingly detached from the\nsubject that could make him rich and, in certain circles, famous.\n\n   ``This is just one small part of what I do, a minor offshoot,''\nTeicher says quietly, preferring to talk about his recent work on\nattention-deficit and hyperactivity disorders.\n\n   In fact, a McLean-supplied biographical sketch that lists 58 of\nhis publications between 1976 and 2000 does not include the\nscientific paper that set him on the Prozac path, and for which he\nis arguably most widely known: ``Emergence of Intense Suicidal\nPreoccupation During Fluoxetine (Prozac) Treatment.''\n\n   Its absence notwithstanding, there is no denying the paper's\nimpact.\n\n   Just four pages, it was written by Teicher, a nurse named Carol\nGlod (who has since earned a doctorate), and fellow Harvard\npsychiatrist Jonathan O. Cole. It was published in February 1990 in\nthe prestigious American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n   In the dry language of academia, the paper describes six\ndepressed patients, ages 19 to 62, five of whom had considered\nkilling themselves in the past but none of whom had recent suicidal\nthoughts.\n\n   The authors detail how all six became powerfully suicidal _\nstricken by a ``state more intense, obsessive, and violent than\nanything they previously had experienced'' _ within weeks of\nbeginning Prozac treatment, and remained so for anywhere from three\ndays to three months after discontinuing the drug. One put a loaded\ngun to her head, and another had to be restrained to prevent\nself-mutilation. None committed suicide.\n\n   With the imprimatur of Harvard psychiatry, the paper was\nreceived by many as proof of the anecdotal and media reports that\nflourished in the years after Prozac's introduction.\n\n   Among the most dramatic was the story of Joseph Wesbecker, a\ndeeply disturbed Kentucky printing-press operator who in 1989\nwalked into his workplace and killed eight people, then himself.\nWesbecker had begun taking Prozac weeks earlier, and its effects\nhad alarmed his psychiatrist, who unsuccessfully urged Wesbecker to\ndiscontinue the drug just days before the carnage.\n\n   Prozac doubters seized on Teicher's paper to press the US Food\nand Drug Administration to ban, or at least investigate, Prozac and\nsimilar antidepressants.\n\n   That is where the Church of Scientology fits in. The most ardent\nProzac critics were members of a group affiliated with Scientology,\nwhich was founded by science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, in part\nbased on his hatred of psychiatry.\n\n   The group trumpeted Teicher's paper and blanketed the media with\nclaims that Prozac was a ``killer drug.'' In one press release the\ngroup stated that ``the numbers of persons who have been driven or\nare being driven suicidal or homicidal by Prozac is astronomical.''\nIt was one of many subtle and not-so-subtle distortions of\nTeicher's paper.\n\n   Teicher and his coauthors had written that the dangerous side\neffect was observed in 3.5 percent of all their patients, and the\nScientologists extrapolated that figure to the entire population of\nProzac users. It was a leap Teicher says had no basis in science\nand left him deeply frustrated.\n\n   Teicher says his contact with the Scientologists was limited to\none phone call in which he complained they were distorting his\ndata. Yet, he says, he suffered ``guilt by association,'' despite\nthe fact that he always believed Prozac was a valuable addition to\nthe psychiatrist's toolbox, ``a breakthrough'' drug that simply\nneeded to be monitored closely for troubling side effects.\n\n   But, for the most part, all anyone heard was that Teicher had\nlinked Prozac to suicide, and the Scientologists were citing him as\ntheir most potent ally.\n\n   The psychiatric community circled the wagons to oppose the\nScientologists' attacks on Prozac and the entire profession,\nsweeping up Teicher in what he called a ``strange, surreal''\nprocess.
