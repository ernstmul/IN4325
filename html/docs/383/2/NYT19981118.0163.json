By May 26, 1994, she was telling nurses that\nshe felt she'd be ready to leave soon.\n\n   But the very next day, she was referred to psychiatrist Faruk\nAbuzzahab, an encounter that put her on a path that led to her\ndeath.\n\n   Abuzzahab, a past president of the Minnesota Psychiatric Society\nand onetime chairman of its ethics committee, had a contract with\nAbbott Laboratories to test the experimental antipsychotic drug\nSertindole. What he earned has not been disclosed, but such\ncontracts typically pay physicians much more than regular health\ninsurance reimbursement, creating a powerful incentive to put\npatients into commercial research trials.\n\n   Endersbe's death offers a peek into the financial side of\ncorporate-funded research of new drugs for the mentally ill. While\nthe development of new antipsychotic drugs has brought new hope for\nschizophrenic patients and allowed many to live successfully in the\ncommunity, the clinical testing of these medications is also big\nbusiness, with the pursuit of money often in conflict with good\npatient care. The result is a research landscape tarnished by the\ngreed of some rogue investigators and repeated instances of\npatients being harmed.\n\n   ``The abuses are there,'' said Dr. Morris Goldman, associate\nprofessor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago School of\nMedicine, who investigated Abuzzahab's transgressions. ``A big part\nis the dollars involved.''\n\n   There are ``people drawn into this field because they are\ninterested in dollars,'' Goldman adds. ``They are very\nprofit-conscious. And that combination of a lot of money, plus the\nadded ethical dilemma you face in human research, that is a bad\ncombination. And there are particular risks with psychiatric\npatients, with the whole issue of informed consent. It can really\ngo wrong.''\n\n   When Abuzzahab enrolled Endersbe into his drug trial, he later\nadmitted to state investigators, he ignored study criteria that\nexcluded patients who were suicidal. And as soon as she stopped\ntaking the venlaxafine that had controlled her symptoms, she\nquickly worsened, state investigators reported.\n\n   Endersbe repeatedly told nurses that she intended to kill\nherself. Devils were now struggling for her mind, her brother said.\nHer complaints were recorded in nurses' notes, but Abuzzahab\npresented a rosy picture in his research records for Abbott.\nEndersbe was experiencing no side effects from the drug, he wrote,\nso he kept her in the trial.\n\n   For nearly two weeks, until June 8, Endersbe received no\nantipsychotic medication. Then, on June 11, when she had been on\nthe experimental drug for three days, Abuzzahab granted her a day\npass to leave the hospital unaccompanied. She went to her apartment\nto gather some keepsakes, slipped the key back under the door, and\nwalked straight to the Franklin Avenue Bridge. Just as she had said\nshe would, Endersbe clambered over the railing and leapt to her\ndeath in the Mississippi River.\n\n   ``For nearly 20 years, my sister was managing to win the battle\nfor her survival, and when she went on a drug study, there were\nsupposed to be safeguards in place to protect her,'' said her\nbrother, Edward Endersbe. ``Not only were they not in place, they\nneglected to have the usual safeguards that she would have had if\nshe stayed on as an inpatient'' outside the drug trial.\n\n   ``And to wash people out from their medication, to take away any\nkind of treatment, that to me is inhumane,'' he added. ``If they\ndid that to someone with a physical illness, I would think it would\nbe criminal.''\n\n     \n   \nTroubling questions\n\n   about patient safety\n\n     \n  \n\n   People with schizophrenia, studies have shown, are at greatest\nrisk of suicide during a relapse, at the beginning of an acute\npsychotic episode, and when they are discharged from the hospital.\nTaking part in a drug trial often exposes them to all those\nfactors.\n\n   In the 1990s, three antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia have\nbeen brought to the market: Zyprexa (olanzapine), Risperdal\n(risperidone), and Seroquel (quetiapine). Abbott Laboratories also\nsubmitted an application for Serlect (sertindole) _ the drug Susan\nEndersbe was given _ but withdrew it after a Food and Drug\nAdministration advisory committee questioned its safety.\n\n   The results of the clinical trials submitted to the FDA,\nobtained by the Globe through Freedom of Information requests,\nraise troubling questions about the safety of schizophrenic\npatients enrolled in commercial drug trials:\n\n   _Among 12,176 patients from the US and abroad who had\nparticipated in trials for all four drugs at the time the data was\nsubmitted to the FDA, there were 88 deaths, including 38 suicides.\n(The figure includes deaths up to 30 days after patients left the\ntrial.) That is an overall death rate of 1 of every 138 volunteers.\n\n   _The suicide rate for the clinical trials is two to five times\nhigher than the norm. In the medical literature, annual suicide\nrates for schizophrenia patients range from two to five deaths per\n1,000 people. The annual suicide rate in the trials, on a\ntime-adjusted basis, was close to 10 per 1,000.\n\n   _In trials for the three approved drugs _ Zyprexa, Risperdal,\nand Seroquel _ 60 percent of the 7,269 patients who received the\nexperimental drug dropped out before the end of the study period,\ntypically six to eight weeks. Patients dropped out because the\ndrugs didn't work, because of side effects, and sometimes because\nthey refused to continue.\n\n   No one has made a detailed study of the mortality or suicide\nrates of subjects in schizophrenia drug trials. When queried, a\nhalf dozen psychiatric researchers expressed varying responses to\nthe numbers collected by the Globe. Some thought they were\nremarkably high. Some argued that the majority of the people\nentering the trials had been chronically ill with schizophrenia,\nand thus a number of suicides and deaths could be expected. And\nsome researchers begged off; they did not know what to make of the\nstatistics.\n\n     \n   \nReasearchers seduced by\n\n   lure of lucrative rewards\n\n     \n  \n\n   The research enterprise that has produced new neuroleptic drugs\nfor schizophrenia has paid off, of course, in important ways. The\nstandard drugs used from the 1950s to the early 1990s typically\nmade patients feel like zombies and caused major side effects that\ndisrupted muscle control. The antipsychotic drugs that have reached\nthe market in recent years (Risperdal, Zyprexa and Seroquel) are\nless sedating and appear to have fewer harmful side effects.\n\n   Desperately ill schizophrenics have turned to clinical trials\nfor early access to these new drugs, and many of those patients\nattest to the attentive care that they received from researchers\nconducting the trials.\n\n   But there are powerful financial factors at work that can tempt\nresearchers to enroll mentally ill patients into drug trials even\nwhen it will not serve the patients' interests.\n\n   Antipsychotic drugs are considered a major and fast-growing\nmarket for the pharmaceutical industry. In 1997, US sales topped\n$1.5 billion, double the figure from two years earlier.\nPharmaceutical companies developing antipsychotic medications know\nthat every day shaved from the testing process can get them to the\nmarket a day sooner, and each day earlier to market represents $1\nmillion to $2 million in additional sales per drug. The companies\nneed to get patients into their trials quickly, and they will pay\nresearchers handsomely for doing so. But they also expect the\nresearchers to deliver. Researchers who do not meet their patient\nquotas are not likely to get a contract for the next project.\n\n   ``The pressures are enormous,'' said Newell Unfried, executive\nvice president of the Alliance for Multispecialty Research, a group\nof leading for-profit research centers. Increasingly, he added,\nperformance reviews ``are being drawn up by pharmaceutical\ncompanies on every physician in clinical research on their patient\nrecruitment. There is pressure to get these patients.''\n\n   In fact, the drug-testing industry today is a highly\ncompetitive, profit-driven enterprise. Only about 25 percent of\ndrug trials are conducted in nonprofit academic medical centers.\nThe rest are conducted by community physicians who contract with\ndrug makers or by for-profit companies whose sole focus is\nconducting drug trials.\n\n   Physicians who do commercial drug research full-time regularly\nreport generating more than $1 million in annual revenues, and\nprofits exceeding $300,000.\n\n   In the 1990s, a Providence-based company, Clinical Studies,\nbuilt a nationwide chain of research centers focusing on drugs for\nAlzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other neurological\ndisorders. The founders sold it in 1997 to a physician-practice\nmanagement company for stock valued at $85 million. Hoping to make\nsimilar scores, venture capital groups have poured more than $100\nmillion into start-ups seeking to duplicate Clinical Studies'\nsuccess.\n\n   In this environment, researchers know that the ``product'' they\ndeliver is patients who can be enrolled in trials and kept there\nuntil they complete the study protocol. Physicians often earn\nbonuses for meeting patient-recruitment goals.\n\n   Critics say the monetary incentives put researchers on a\nslippery slope, particularly when it comes to testing schizophrenia\ndrugs. Their financial interests push them to recruit patients\naggressively, yet the trials expose the patients to numerous risks.\n\n   But Dr. Stanley Cheren, a Brookline psychiatrist who conducts\ncommercial drug trials on a full-time basis, insists ``there are a\nnumber of things that keep you sober and honest _ your own\nconscience.\n\n   ``Leaving that aside, you are accountable to the patient and to\nthe patient's family, and they do raise hell when things aren't\ngoing well. The hospital staff keeps you accountable. And the third\nthing always lurking in the background is the FDA. If you recruit a\nlot of patients and do it fast, the FDA takes that as a red flag\nand audits your site.''\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nLURE OF RICHES FUELS CLINICAL TESTING \n","Text":["\n   During the first three weeks she spent in Fairview Riverside\nHospital, Susan Endersbe, a 41-year-old Minneapolis woman\nstruggling with schizophrenia and suicidal impulses, obtained care\nand medication that made her feel much better.\n","\n   Her mood lightened.
