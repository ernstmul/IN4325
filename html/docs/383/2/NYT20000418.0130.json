With these\ndrugs, there is very little difference between a therapeutic dose\nand a dangerous overdose or underdose.\n\n   For some drugs, especially those taken for congestive heart\nfailure, asthma, epilepsy or psychosis and some high blood pressure\nand diabetes drugs, patients should consult their physicians before\nsubstituting a generic for a brand-name version.\n\n   ``It isn't that these generics are bad. They can be perfectly\nfine, and most of the time, they are,'' says Dr. Robert Berkow,\neditor of the Merck Manual. ``But, for a drug like theophyline and\nsome of the hormone formulations and heart drugs, we recommend\nagainst switching.\n\n   ``Hormone preparations all work, but if you are taking one and\nyou like the way it is working for you, whether it's generic or\nbrand name, I wouldn't want you to switch. A very tiny difference\ncould be a problem. The drug itself may be equivalent, but pressed\ninto a tablet, it may not be so equivalent. It's not always a\nquestion of one being better than the other, but of changing from\none to another.''\n\n   For long-lasting potassium supplements, Berkow says doctors\nrecommend against generics sold in tablet form, but capsules may be\nfreely substituted. It seems that some generic potassium tablets\nare so compressed they do not dissolve quickly enough to be\nabsorbed fully.\n\n   In another example, Berkow says that when he prescribes warfarin\n(to prevent blood clotting) he has a good idea of how the brand he\nprescribes is going to work, so he wouldn't want patients to take a\ngeneric.\n\n   ``I don't want anybody switching it to another preparation\nbecause the range of safety is too narrow. It may lose its effects\nand you end up with a blood clot or it may be too effective, and\nyou end up with uncontrolled bleeding,'' Berkow says.\n\n   Fewer prescriptions are written ``DAW,'' (dispense as written)\ntoday, but when they are, there is usually good reason, says Dr.\nMarvin Shepherd of the University of Texas College of Pharmacy.\n\n   Digoxin, a heart medicine, is almost always prescribed under the\nbrand name, Lanoxin, for example, because so many people have used\nit under that brand name for so long, and doctors know it is very\ndependable and predictable.\n\n   In a reversal of their usual policy, some HMOs refuse to cover\nthe cost of generic digoxin.\n\n   ``If you have a heart medicine that works for you, you don't\nwant to change it,'' says Shepherd. ``It is an inexpensive drug\nthat costs about $8 a month for the brand-name.
