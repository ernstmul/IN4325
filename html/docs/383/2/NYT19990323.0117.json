Michels, an epidemiologist at\nHarvard Medical School and a prominent critic of the use of\nplacebos in trials of new drugs, when effective medications for\ndiseases are already on the market.\n\n   The studies, mainly funded by pharmaceutical firms, have\nprimarily involved patients at state mental institutions and\nVeterans Affairs hospitals from Massachusetts to California,\naccording to the Globe's review of both published studies and\nunpublished data reported to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\n   ``God, they're treating the mentally ill like lab rats. This is\nabsolutely outrageous,'' said Paul K. Ling, a Quincy psychologist\nwho is a leader in the Massachusetts-wide Consortium for\nPsychotherapy, which advocates greater access to care for the\nmentally ill. ``They are exploiting the most vulnerable segment of\nthe population.''\n\n   In tests of drugs for many medical conditions, especially those\nfor which there is no good treatment, placebo controls are common.\nBut patients with cancer or fast-moving bacterial infections, for\ninstance, would never be put on sugar pills as part of studying\npotentially new chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics. They would\ninstead be given medications already known to work to compare with\npatients given the trial medication.\n\n   The practice of using a so-called placebo control in testing\nexperimental anti-psychotics and certain other drugs, even when\nthere are already effective medications on the market, has long\nbeen demanded by the FDA as a scientific ``gold standard'' to\nmeasure drug efficacy, and pharmaceutical firms and researchers\nhave complied.\n\n   ``We believe in good science. We believe in following FDA\nregulations,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, senior vice president of\nscientific and regulatory affairs for Pharmaceutical Research\nManufacturers of America, commonly known as PhRMA, an industry\ngroup. As a result, he said, ``Usually, good science and good\nethics prevail.''\n\n   But after a Globe series on psychiatric research that\nhighlighted drug-testing issues in November and amid growing\nconcerns by some ethicists and scientists, the FDA and the National\nInstitute of Mental Health now plan to review the use of placebos,\naccording to federal officials and others familiar with the\nagencies' deliberations.\n\n   The FDA is sponsoring a symposium next month on placebo\nexperiments in general, not just for the mentally ill, and has\ninvited a prominent critic, Dr. Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's\nHealth Research Group, along with others, to debate the issue.\n\n   The Globe series focused on experiments in which mentally ill\npatients were allowed to deteriorate after being deprived of drugs\nthat have worked for them or after having been given substances\nthat actually worsen their psychosis.\n\n   The series has helped spur a debate on drug-testing practices,\nparticularly placebo use, by the American College of\nNeuropsychopharmacology, an international psychiatric research\ngroup, according to one scientist who has participated in the\nheated discussion over the use of placebos.\n\n   The series has also prompted the Massachusetts Department of\nMental Health to put on hold two studies involving placebos while\nnew research guidelines to protect patients are finalized in the\nnext month, said Dr. Paul Barreira, a DMH deputy commissioner.\n\n   And the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, appointed by the\npresident, has recommended that the US Department of Health and\nHuman Services retain the Institute of Medicine to review\nplacebo-controlled studies, along with research that induces\npsychosis in people with mental illness, according to Eric M.\nMeslin, the commission's executive director.\n\n   The Globe's new analysis looked at unpublished data submitted to\nthe FDA in the 1990s by pharmaceutical firms for three\nantipsychotic drugs that have since been approved: Zyprexa\n(olanzapine), Risperdal (risperidone), and Seroquel (quetiapine).\nAnd it reviewed the published scientific literature for those\ndrugs, and a fourth _ Serlect (sertindole), which was withdrawn\nfrom consideration after an FDA advisory committee questioned its\nsafety.\n\n   Out of the more than 850 patients given a placebo, 236 were in\nstudies of Zyprexa, 195 in studies of Risperdal, 206 in studies of\nSeroquel, and at least 221 in studies of Serlect, according to the\nanalysis.\n\n   According to the review of the published literature, the Globe\nalso found that researchers enrolled patients who were so severely\nill that their ability to understand the risk of being given a\nsugar pill was questionable.\n\n   For example, one 1996 study said patients assigned to a placebo\nhad met ``criteria for schizophrenia with acute exacerbation,'' and\nyet were said to have given ``written informed consent.''\n\n   Another 1996 study said patients on a placebo had been\nexperiencing ``acute exacerbation'' for an average of 91 days, and\nhad been hospitalized for almost three weeks on average, before\nsigning up for the research.\n\n   The Globe review also found that psychiatric researchers even\nanticipated a high dropout rate among patients on placebos as a\nresult of worsening symptoms. For example, a 1997 study stated that\n``as expected, lack of efficacy was the primary reason for\nwithdrawal and was seen most often in the placebo groups,'' with 35\nout of 51 patients on a placebo, or 69 percent, withdrawing.\n\n   In a study of the drug Zyprexa that ended in 1995, a 34-year-old\nman committed suicide while on a placebo.\n\n   Out of the more than 850 people placed on a placebo in studies\nacross the United States and Canada in the 1990s, a couple of dozen\nof them were enrolled through the state's Massachusetts Mental\nHealth Center, under the auspices of a Harvard associate professor\nof psychiatry, Dr. Alan I. Green. Based on the state's changing\nresearch guidelines, those studies, completed several years ago,\nwould probably not be allowed at the DMH facility now.\n\n   In an interview, Green said, ``I think you always want to ask\nthe question, `What's ethical?' The FDA has determined that the\nonly way to figure out whether a drug works or not, in certain\nareas, certainly in this area, is to use a placebo control.''\n\n   But he added, ``The whole field, including the FDA, including\nethicists, is trying to decide the best way to conduct trials. I\nthink everybody is trying to do the same thing, which is to make\nnewer, better medications available. As better medications become\navailable, the way you think this through conceivably could\nevolve.''\n\n   The Globe's new findings, along with the already rising concern\nabout the use of placebos, prompted scientists and ethicists to\nsound an even louder alarm last week about the use of placebos in\ncertain studies.\n\n   ``This is probably the most harmful ongoing research abuse in\nNorth America,'' said Dr. Charles Weijer, bioethicist and assistant\nprofessor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Canada, who helped\ndevise new Canadian guidelines prohibiting placebo use in certain\nstudies, particularly those involving people with schizophrenia.\n\n   ``It is appalling,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of Maryland\nbioethicist who co-founded Citizens for Responsible Care in\nPsychiatry and Research with Vera Hassner Sharav.\n\n   ``When there is a drug that has been demonstrated by convincing\nevidence to be safe and effective for a life-threatening disease,\none should not go back after that point and use placebos in future\ntrials,'' said LeRoy Walters, director of the Kennedy Institute of\nEthics at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\n   ``I would categorize schizophrenia as a life-threatening\ndisorder,'' especially with the relatively high risk of suicide,\nWalters said. ``There should not be a placebo group in my view.''\n\n   FDA officials could not be reached for comment on Friday, but\nhave previously said they require a placebo for scientific rigor,\nto make sure the drugs under study are efficacious.\n\n   But Kenneth J. Rothman, a professor of epidemiology at Boston\nUniversity School of Public Health and editor of the journal\nEpidemiology, disputed the FDA's claims.\n\n   ``Some people who think you can't do a study without a placebo _\nthey're wrong,'' said Rothman, who co-authored with Harvard's\nMichels a widely cited article in the New England Journal of\nMedicine criticizing the misuse of placebos.\n\n   In fact, Rothman said, using a placebo for comparison in tests\nof experimental drugs instead of medications known to be effective\nmay lead to the approval of drugs that are better than nothing, but\nworse than the best that is already on the market.\n\n   Globe correspondent Robert Whitaker contributed to this report.\n","Headline":"\nUSE OF PLACEBOS ON MENTAL PATIENTS QUESTIONED\n","Text":["\n   Over the last decade, at least 850 patients seriously ill with\nschizophrenia were given dummy sugar pills instead of medications\nknown to work, as part of US-approved studies of experimental\nanti-psychotic drugs.\n","\n   Up to 70 percent of the patients randomly assigned to receive a\nplacebo, as the dummy pill is called, experienced such a worsening\nof symptoms that they had to withdraw from the trials, and at least\none patient committed suicide, according to a Globe review of the\nexperiment data.\n","\n   ``How could you possibly put somebody on placebo when they could\ncommit suicide?'' said Karin B.
