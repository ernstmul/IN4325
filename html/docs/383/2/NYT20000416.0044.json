The total number could be higher still since\nnot all coroners where heat deaths occurred performed toxicology\ntests.\n\n   A Dayton Daily News review of coroner reports immediately\nfollowing the July 21 to Aug. 3 heat wave found that at least 10\nwho died from heat stroke in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Kentucky\ntook such medications. The medications interfere with the body's\nthermo-regulatory system, hazards known to physicians but seldom\npublicized.\n\n   Toxicology results from autopsies of 86 of the 116 reported dead\nin Chicago _ test results not available last summer _ found that 10\nhad anti-psychotic or anti-depressant medications in their\nbloodstreams at the time of death. Common drugs included Mellaril,\nElavil, Prozac and Zoloft.\n\n   ``There's no question people on anti-psychotic drugs have to be\nmore cautious in the sun and heat,'' Chicago chief medical examiner\nEdmund Donoghue said. ``They are vulnerable.''\n\n   The test results also found 20 with alcohol in their systems,\nfour with cocaine, and two with morphine.\n\n   In Cincinnati, a case study by the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl examined 17 of the 18 reported heat deaths. It found that\nfour of the dead had prescriptions for medication with heat risks.\n\n   ``Results of a case-control study showed a particularly high\nrisk among young people with mental problems,'' the CDC report\nsaid.\n\n   ``We had four people on medication that can cause heat stroke,''\nsaid Carl Parrott, Hamilton County Coroner. ``The goal now is to\nhelp refine the response to these heat emergencies.''\n\n   The CDC found that all of the Cincinnati dead had known risk\nfactors besides mental illness, including social isolation and no\nair conditioning at their residence. None of the victims had\nvisited an official or private cooling shelter.\n\n   In all, eight of the 17 had mental problems, the CDC said.\n\n   Ohio's 24 fatalities prompted Ohio Rep. Samuel Britton,\nD-Cincinnati, to propose a bill requiring air conditioning in group\nand nursing homes and assisted living centers. The bill also\nrequires air conditioning in housing for those older than 65. House\nBill 474 is currently awaiting action in the house Health,\nRetirement and Aging Committee.\n\n   The CDC report recommended an emphasis on tracking people at\nrisk and increasing outreach, tightening regulations to limit\ntemperatures in assisted care facilities, and providing more\ntraining for those who deal with heat-sensitive people.\n\n   Carol Rubin, acting chief of the CDC's Health Studies Branch,\nsaid air conditioning is a key factor in surviving a heat wave.\n\n   ``It's the one overwhelmingly protective factor,'' she said.\n``Even limited exposure to air conditioning. It's part of most city\nheat plans.''\n\n   Cincinnati Health Commissioner Adcock, who requested the CDC\nstudy, said he supports Britton's legislation because a deadly heat\nstroke can suddenly affect those on medication without many obvious\nsymptoms.\n\n   ``One of the lessons we learned is that it is not enough to\nsimply monitor,'' he said. ``We need a preventive strategy that\nwould allow temperatures to be maintained appropriately.''\n\n   As yet, the state Department of Health, which inspects group\nhomes, hasn't taken a position on Britton's bill. Marijean Siehl,\ndirector of public affairs, said the department is concerned air\nconditioning could cost group home operators too much and that\nresidents might squabble over the air conditioning and that the\ndepartment would also have to inspect the air conditioning units.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ Findings from health authorities have doubled the\nnumber of deaths related to psychiatric medications taken by the\nmentally ill during last summer's fierce Midwestern heat wave.\n","\n   New figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta\nand the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office in Chicago show that\nat least 23 of the estimated 300 dead were mentally ill people who\ntook medicines that made them especially vulnerable to death from\nintense summer heat.
