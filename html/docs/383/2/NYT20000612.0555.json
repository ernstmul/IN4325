{"DocumentId":"NYT20000612.0555","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-NEW-PROZAC-ART-2ND \n   TAKE-BOS  \n UNDATED: ... the criticism.  \n \n\n   A climax of sorts was reached in 1991, when the FDA dismissed\nany link between suicide and Prozac or similar antidepressants. A\nnine-member panel of experts voted unanimously that there was ``no\ncredible evidence'' of any association, and split 6-3 against\nrequiring a stronger warning label.\n\n   In the aftermath, critics disparaged the panel _ ``a kangaroo\ncourt,'' in the words of one lawyer who has pending lawsuits\nagainst Lilly _ as riven by conflicts of interest and armed with\nflawed data from the company's clinical studies. Lilly also came\nunder fire.\n\n   ``Lilly's efforts to discredit clinicians, scientists, and\njournalists trying to foster greater discussions, research, and\nawareness of this side effect is one of the most disgraceful\nchapters in American corporate history,'' said Harvard psychiatrist\nJoseph Glenmullen, author of the new book ``Prozac Backlash,''\nwhich focuses in part on tendency toward suicide.\n\n   Still, the FDA's finding has been the cornerstone of Lilly's\ndefense of Prozac in public and the courts.\n\n   Lilly officials declined several requests for interviews, but in\na written statement the company restated the 1991 FDA decision:\n``There is no scientific evidence that establishes a link between\nProzac and violent or suicidal behavior.''\n\n   Today, Teicher looks back on the early 1990s with what seems\nlike preternatural equanimity: ``It was a good life lesson. I\nbasically did fine.''\n\n   Asked to define the lesson, he says: ``What I learned from all\nthis is I cared much less what people thought. . . . There are\nalways going to be colleagues who disagree with me about this. A\ndefinitive study hasn't been done. Maybe 20 years from now there\nwill be a clear answer, but maybe not.''\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   What his critics did not know was that Teicher, since early\n1992, had been working on what might be called a ``cure'' for the\nproblems he saw in Prozac.\n\n   By all accounts, that turn of events began one morning when a\nbear of a man named Timothy J. Barberich was reading The Wall\nStreet Journal. He came across a story about the Prozac controversy\nthat mentioned Teicher's work.\n\n   Barberich was not just any reader, though. He had parlayed his\nundergraduate chemistry degree into founder, chairman, and chief\nexecutive of an upstart drug company called Sepracor Inc., in\nMarlborough, half an hour west of Teicher's office.\n\n   Barberich and one of his top scientists, James W. Young, decided\nto call Teicher to talk about a chemical process Sepracor had\ndeveloped to reformulate existing drugs by removing unwanted side\neffects. By the early 1990s, the company had targeted 40 or so\nalready-approved drugs _ including Prozac _ that it hoped to\nimprove, patent, and then market on its own or in partnership with\nthe old drugs' owner.\n\n   Teicher, as it turns out, had been studying the science of that\nprocess in his laboratory, feeding different chemical substances to\nrats and sending them into a maze. In early 1992, Teicher and\nSepracor struck a deal under which the company would fund about\n$150,000 of research in his lab.\n\n   To understand what happened next requires a painless chemistry\nlesson, first taught in the 1800s by Louis Pasteur.\n\n   Pasteur discovered that most man-made chemical compounds _\nprescription drugs, for instance _ exist at a microscopic level as\ntwins, called isomers. Although the twins are chemically identical,\neach one is not the mirror image of the other.\n\n   In some drugs, only one of the twins provides the benefits,\nfitting into chemical receptors in the body to flip switches on or\noff to fight illness. The other twin does not fit the same\nreceptors, so it is free to wander through the body. Sometimes it\ngoes looking for trouble. That is, causing side effects.\n\n   The most dramatic example was the 1960s drug thalidomide, one of\nwhose twins was the good Dr. Jekyll, effectively decreasing morning\nsickness in pregnant women. The other was the evil Mr. Hyde, a\nchemical monster that caused horrible birth defects.\n\n   Until the last 20 years or so, it was difficult to separate the\ntwins _ and sometimes, both twins have problems of their own _ so\ngovernment regulators allowed drugmakers to sell medicines\nincluding both, as long as the side effects were not terrible.\n\n   That was Lilly's argument for Prozac, which allows brain cells\nto bathe more freely in a chemical called serotonin, which affects\nmood and emotion. To this day, despite millions of prescriptions\nfor the drug, scientists are not certain precisely how Prozac\nworks, but it is generally believed that the added serotonin in a\nbrain on Prozac lessens depression.\n\n   Lilly acknowledges that the current formula also can cause side\neffects including non-life-threatening ailments such as headaches,\nanxiety, tremors, and sexual dysfunction. But not suicidal\ntendencies.\n\n   Teicher and Sepracor set out to find a way to keep the good\nparts of Prozac, or improve it, while eliminating the bad. Within\nsix months of starting his work, Teicher and Sepracor officials\nsay, he recognized which of the Prozac twins was the one most worth\nkeeping.\n\n   Teicher noticed that when he gave his rats the part of Prozac\nthat would be considered the ``good'' twin _ known chemically as\nR-fluoxetine _ the rodents bravely explored the more dangerous,\nexposed parts of the maze, spending less time anxiously scurrying\nto the enclosed, protected areas.\n\n   It took a lot more work, lots more rats, and five more years to\nget a patent, during which both Teicher and Sepracor experienced\nbumps in the road. Teicher weathered an embarrassing state medical\nboard investigation into allegations, eventually dismissed, of\nsexual misconduct with a patient. Sepracor, meanwhile, was\nfrustrating stockholders with yearly losses.\n\n   Eventually, though, Teicher and the two Sepracor officials,\nBarberich and Young, succeeded in patenting their discovery,\nreceiving one in 1997 and the second in 1998.\n\n   The patents tout their drug's effectiveness as an antidepressant\nand appetite suppressant, an anxiety reliever, and a potential\ntreatment for migraine headaches, chronic pain, and\nobsessive-compulsive disorders. Its residual effects leave the body\nsooner than the existing Prozac, the patent says, allowing doctors\nto try other drugs more quickly if it proves ineffective.\n\n   Lilly has no problem with any of that. But then comes the patent\nlanguage that has caused the current uproar: ``The adverse affects\n(sic) which are decreased by administering the (new version of\nProzac) include but are not limited to headaches, nervousness,\nanxiety, insomnia, inner restlessness (akathisia), suicidal\nthoughts and self-mutilation.''\n\n   And so, with one swing of a patent examiner's approval stamp,\nLilly's decade-long denials about suicidality ran headlong into the\nclaims of a promising new drug that Lilly was eager to buy.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Teicher refers questions about the patent to Sepracor, and\nBarberich finds himself in the awkward position of defending the\nnew Prozac without offending his powerful partner, Lilly.\n\n   First, Barberich downplays the issue: ``I don't want to get my\npatent disallowed, but it's not as if you have any evidence for\nwhat you're claiming in the broadest sense. . . . There's no court\nof truth that these patents go through. I believe that they, Lilly,\nare correct.''\n\n   Then, he hedges: ``Marty Teicher may be right, Eli Lilly may be\nright, and the FDA may be right, and we still wouldn't have any\nidea whether (the new drug) eliminates a problem that we're not\nsure exists.''\n\n   Although Lilly officials would not discuss the patent, their\nstatement sought to put distance between Lilly and the damaging\npatent language: ``Lilly had no input nor provided content for the\npatent application. Not all the `side effects' listed in the patent\nare scientifically demonstrated facts. . . . Teicher's article was\na series of anecdotal reports, and his suggestions of a\n`possibility' of a causal relationship have been refuted by\nmultiple . . . studies that have demonstrated no increased risk of\nsuicide associated with Prozac use.''\n\n   Barberich also said Lilly had no role in the patent. He said the\nIndianapolis-based drugmaker opened talks with Sepracor only after\nthe patent was certain to be approved.\n\n   He also said there were no discussions with Lilly about the\nsuicide issue when Lilly purchased exclusive rights to the patent\nin late 1998. The deal gives Sepracor $20 million up front _ due to\nbe paid by the end of this month _ plus another $70 million if the\ndrug gets FDA approval, as anticipated within the next two years.\n\n   If that approval comes, the real money for Sepracor, Teicher,\nand McLean Hospital could start rolling in as early as 2002. ``It's\nlikely it's going to be a big drug. It's just a question of how\nbig,'' Barberich said.\n\n   Under the terms of the deal with Lilly, Sepracor gets about 10\npercent of sales. McLean gets 10 percent of that, of which the\nhospital gets half, Teicher personally gets one-quarter and his\nlaboratory gets one-quarter.\n\n   Prozac revenues for Lilly were $2.6 billion last year. If the\nnew Prozac becomes a $2 billion-a-year drug, Sepracor would get\n$200 million a year, of which McLean gets $10 million, and Teicher\nand his lab each would receive $5 million.\n\n   Back in his office, Teicher acknowledges that he finds himself\nthinking about the money sometimes. He said a need for money\nprompted him to stop seeing patients two years ago, so he could\nfocus on ``entrepreneurial'' activities to fund his son's college\neducation.\n\n   He also thinks about the potential conflict involved in\nprescribing and lecturing about a drug in which he has a large\nfinancial stake, but he expects to handle that by simply disclosing\nhis interest.\n\n   Teicher says he spends almost no time thinking about a patent on\nhis wall that says he was right all along, and even less time\nthinking about vindication.\n\n   ``I'm not sure vindication will ever come,'' he says. ``I'm not\nsure I need it or want it.''\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   A climax of sorts was reached in 1991, when the FDA dismissed\nany link between suicide and Prozac or similar antidepressants.
