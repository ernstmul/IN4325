More than half of his compensation\ncame from the pharmaceutical industry, including companies such as\nPfizer Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wyeth-Ayerst, and Eli Lilly, all\nof which market antidepressants that Keller lauded in a series of\nmedical research reports.\n\n   In addition, Keller did not disclose the extent of his financial\nties with the companies to the medical journals that published his\nresearch in 1998, or to the American Psychiatric Association, which\nsponsored the meetings at which Keller presented his findings.\n\n   While cozy financial relationships between drug companies and\nmedical researchers have long been a source of concern for\nuniversities and medical institutions, consumer advocates worry\nthat the problem is growing as universities tighten their budgets\nand researchers are pressed to bring in more outside funding.\n\n   Several ethicists contacted by the Globe say Keller's unusually\nlarge consulting fees _ he pulled in a total of $556,000 in 1998\nand $444,000 in 1997 _ constitute the most serious potential\nconflict they've heard of yet.\n\n   ``Such financial ties can't help but influence a researcher's\nobjectivity and can lead to the inappropriate prescribing of drugs\nthat are less safe and effective and more expensive than older\ndrugs,'' said Larry Sasich, a health-research analyst for Public\nCitizen, a watchdog group in Washington. ``The victim in all of\nthis is the patient.''\n\n   Brown University officials said its School of Medicine has no\nproblem with Keller's consulting arrangements. However, they\ndeclined to comment on what the university knew about his financial\nties. Brown does not require its researchers to disclose the\nspecific amounts they receive in consulting arrangements, only\nwhether they are earning more than $10,000, as required by federal\nlaw.\n\n   ``We're very concerned about potential financial conflicts,''\nsaid Laura Freid, executive vice president for public affairs and\nuniversity relations. ``You're making the assumption that someone\nwho earns more than $10,000 has an immediate conflict, and I don't\nthink you can do that.''\n\n   Keller did not return repeated phone calls to his office.\n\n   Several prominent medical schools, including those at Harvard\nand Georgetown, prohibit or strongly discourage faculty members\nfrom performing research if they are receiving more than $10,000\nfrom a company that stands to benefit from it.\n\n   ``The public relies on academics to find out the truth and\nadvise public agencies about what is safe and what isn't, what is\ntrue and what is false,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor emeritus\nof the New England Journal of Medicine and professor emeritus of\nmedicine at Harvard Medical School. ``If I were this person's\n(supervisor), I would have major concerns that such a large sum of\nmoney would bias his thinking and judgment.''\n\n   However, the journal itself was stung last week by an ethical\nbreach when it was disclosed that an author of an editorial\npraising two baldness medications did not disclose that she was a\npaid consultant to the companies that manufacture the drugs.\n\n   Keller, meanwhile, is a valuable resource for Brown University,\nattracting millions in research grants and donations. According to\nthe psychiatry department's annual report and other documents,\nKeller has brought in about $14.4 million in research funding from\npharmaceutical companies and federal agencies since 1993.\nApproximately $8.4 million has come from the National Institute for\nMental Health for research on mental illness.\n\n   Nine months ago, Brown was forced to return $300,170 Keller's\npsychiatry department had collected from Massachusetts for research\nthat state officials say the department never performed. Brown\nreturned the money shortly after the Massachusetts attorney\ngeneral's office filed a civil lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court,\naccusing Brown of breaching research contracts with the\nMassachusetts Department of Mental Health.\n\n   The attorney general's investigation was prompted by a Globe\nseries about allegations that the Brown psychiatry department had\nsubmitted partially fabricated invoices for research it never\nperformed. The Globe also reported that Keller, who has headed the\npsychiatry department since 1989, was investigated by the Rhode\nIsland attorney general's office in 1994 for allegedly padding his\ntravel expenses and double-billing pharmaceutical companies and\nacademic institutions for trips he made.\n\n   The attorney general dropped the inquiry after Brown decided to\nhandle the matter internally, Rhode Island police said at the time.\nUniversity officials said that Keller had repaid Brown $918 for\ntravel expenses after an audit of his travel billing.\n\n   A review of financial records and research Keller has published\nshow the extent of his financial ties to the pharmaceutical\nindustry the past two years:\n\n   --In 1998, the same year he published three studies with\ncolleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association and\nthe Journal of Clinical Psychiatry touting the efficacy of Zoloft,\na new antidepressant manufactured by Pfizer Inc., he received\n$218,000 in personal income and more than $3 million in research\nfunding from Pfizer, a pharmaceutical giant located in New York\nCity.\n\n   --Also in 1998, Keller authored a review article in the journal\nBiological Psychiatry in which he concluded that newer\nantidepressants, including Serzone, Zoloft, and Effexor, were all\neffective medications for depression and that people with major\ndepression were not receiving adequate drug treatment.
