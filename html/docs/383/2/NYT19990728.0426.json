Step by step, his ``Journey for Life'' has\npounded away at the stigma that surrounds mental illness.\n\n   And today, Perry will deliver thousands of petitions collected\nalong the journey to the American Medical Association headquarters\nin Chicago, urging the nation's doctors to screen their patients\nroutinely for depression, which strikes an estimated 18 million\nAmericans.\n\n   Momentum has grown along the route. Perry has spoken in\n\n   his down-to-earth manner to churches, rallies and rotary clubs.\nHe has done interviews with more than 75 newspapers, TV and radio\nstations. He has appeared on call-in shows, was honored at\nLouisville, Ky.'s Churchill Downs racetrack and met the inventor of\nProzac, the anti-depressant that Perry credits with saving his\nlife.\n\n   Did he have doubts about covering 1,000 miles ? ``I knew I'd\nmake it,'' Perry said. ``If you've been clinically depressed, this\nis a breeze.''\n\n   It has meant covering 15 to 25 miles a day, seven days a week,\nwith only two days off, when he rested in bed. ``I didn't miss a\nmile,'' Perry said. He adds, laughing: ``I have a heck of a tan.''\n\n   He's working on his fifth pair of sneakers. He has survived a\nclose call with a Tennessee rattlesnake (``It scared me to\ndeath''), an infected toe and a car of kids throwing bottles at\nhim, trying to run him down (``I jumped into a ditch''). Over the\nlast few days, as he was winding up the journey, the Midwestern\nheat index hit triple digits.\n\n   Friends accompanying Perry have kept his spirits high. Donations\nhave ranged from two Fleetwood motor coaches, grants from drug\nmanufacturers, to home-cooked meals along the way.\n\n   ``He certainly changed lives here,'' said Jill Kartisek of the\nMental Health Association of Northern Kentucky. Through his\ninterviews, she says, Perry reached an unusually high number of\nmales, who showed up at depression screenings, or sought\ninformation about depression.\n\n   One couple heard him on a talk show, then followed him on the\nroad, helping him plant a tree in Kokomo, Ind. ``They lost their\nson to suicide,'' says Perry, whose father killed himself 20 years\nago.\n\n   Perry also visited a state hospital for the mentally ill in\nKentucky. ``He gave hope to those people _ that you can come out on\nthe other side with a life that has meaning and productivity,''\nsaid Margaret Pennington, commissioner of Kentucky's department of\nmental health and mental retardation.\n\n   After meeting with the AMA, Perry will return to his family and\nAmericus, where he plans to help run a counseling center.
