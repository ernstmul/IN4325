KAHN  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \nPROZAC DIARY \nBy Lauren Slater \nRandom House, 203 pp., $21.95 \n \n\n   A funny book about Prozac? That seems a conceptual stretch,\nespecially from a young author who is as candid about the pitfalls\nof taking Prozac _ including writer's block and sexual dysfunction\n_ as she is about the drug's psychologically liberating properties.\n\n   Humor, however, turns out to be one of the chief virtues of\nLauren Slater's ``Prozac Diary,'' which takes up roughly where the\ncritically acclaimed ``Welcome to My Country,'' her first book\nabout her battle with mental illness, left off. Material that might\nbe cloying or self-pitying in the hands of a lesser writer sparkles\nwith originality in hers. A treatise on psychopharmacology (``the\none branch of medicine where there is no need for intimacy,''\nwrites Slater) becomes a bittersweet love story about A Woman and\nHer Pill. The real-life love story of the author and her boyfriend,\na chemist, inspires a hilarious episode concerning homeopathy and\ncodependence.\n\n   Slater even leaps from a sober meditation on frigidity to the\nnotion that Prozac could be the ultimate tool for radical feminists\n_ freeing heterosexual women from the tyranny of libido by\nrendering men, well, useless. Elsewhere, she recounts a furious\nexchange with her doctor after the drug's potency has inexplicably\nworn off. Well, the physician suggests, it must be a case of\n``Prozac poop-out.'' Slater: ```Prozac poop-out?' I said. `You've\ngot to be kidding me.' I was taking a drug with a prostate problem,\na drug with sexual dysfunction ...'' Finding such humor amid a\nharrowing relapse speaks strongly to Slater's writerly instincts.\n\n   In her other life, Slater, a psychologist with degrees from\nHarvard and Boston University, runs an outpatient clinic in East\nBoston. Between the ages of 14 and 24, however, she was\nhospitalized five times for depression and obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder. An anorexic, she still bears the scars of having sliced\nherself with razor blades. Until she found Prozac, Slater had never\nhad a steady boyfriend or a normal relationship with food or a\nsemblance of a vocation, other than writing poetry and short\nstories.\n\n   Then, in 1988, she was given the potent antidepressant that had\njust hit the market. Slater began with 20 milligrams daily; she\nwould wind up with a prescription for four times that dosage. Her\ninitial reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that her doctor\ndoubted it could be real. She felt high, Slater writes _ acid-trip\nhigh. A brave new world opened up to her: first through real estate\nmagazines and open houses, then bar drinks, home cooking, and ATM\nmachines. She was a 26-year-old with ``the judgment of an early\nadolescent,'' as she describes it. Meeting a stranger at a rock\nconcert, she follows him to a park and reluctantly has sex with\nhim. With her liberation come dangers for which Slater is totally\nunprepared.\n\n   A year later, Prozac has replaced writing as her one true love.\nShe gets a job teaching literacy skills to immigrants. She gains\nacceptance to graduate school. From small triumphs _ keeping an\napartment, managing a checkbook _ she moves on to far greater ones.\nMeanwhile, she finds herself surrendering to the drug's deeper\nspiritual and philosophical mysteries. ``Secretly,'' writes Slater,\n``I started to fear a nuclear war only for the effects it would\nhave on the pharmacies.''\n\n   Each step forward is dogged by doubt, however. Illness has been\nso strong a component of her identity that its absence causes\nSlater to panic. Her intellectual affinity for philosophers and\ntheologians causes Slater to liken Prozac to a ``Zen drug'' and\nherself to a Buddhist novitiate: another side effect not advertised\nby the drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly.\n\n   ``Maybe Prozac has made me into a nun,'' the author worries,\n``or a nurse, or worse, a Calgon Lady.'' She contests Peter\nKramer's assertion in ``Listening to Prozac'' that the drug makes\nits users ``better than well.'' Instead, Slater suggests, Prozac is\nmore like ``psychotropic Drano'' _ a remedy that trades higher\nfunctioning for addiction and the frustrating loss of creativity.\n\n   ``Prozac Diary'' is made up of notes and journal entries, scraps\nof memory, and letters to Slater's doctor. The collage effect\nnotwithstanding, the book is tightly bound by its humor and\nintelligence. Slater's writing is confessional without being\nsentimental, honest without being overbearing.\n\n   While she has tried to wean herself off Prozac, Slater still\ndepends on it, she writes, to get along with her life and career.\nOn good days, she calculates, that means functioning at 70 percent\ncapacity.\n\n   ``Prozac is a medicine that takes much away,'' the author\nconcludes, ``but its very presence in my life has been about\npreserving as well as decaying.''\n\n   With wit and courage, she makes that presence felt.\n","Headline":"\nPOETICALLY EXAMINING PROZAC'S PARADOX \n","Text":["\n   A funny book about Prozac?
