A criminal case in Georgia\nrevealed just how far.\n\n   Dr. Richard Borison and Bruce Diamond were longtime favorites of\npharmaceutical companies developing schizophrenia drugs. Borison,\n48, chairman of the psychiatry department at the Medical College of\nGeorgia in Augusta, and Diamond, 53, a pharmacologist on the\nschool's faculty, had demonstrated time and again a knack for\nbringing psychotic patients quickly into trials funded by drug\ncompanies. Eli Lilly, Janssen, Zeneca, Novartis _ they all came\nknocking.\n\n   As faculty, Borison and Diamond were supposed to get approval\nfrom the medical school for their research. Drug-company payments\nfor clinical trials were supposed to be sent to the school. But\naccording to Georgia state authorities, who indicted the pair in\nearly 1997, they began in 1989 to have the companies send payments\ndirectly to them. They opened an office across the street from the\nmedical school, used a commercial service to do ethical reviews of\ntheir studies, and placed their staff on the school's payroll while\nkeeping all the research funding for themselves.\n\n   From 1989 to 1996, Borison and Diamond made over $10 million\nfrom drug trials, including more than $4 million from schizophrenia\ndrugs, according to the indictment and sworn testimony from their\nstaff during an investigation by the Augusta Veterans Affairs\nHospital, where Borison was chief of psychiatry. Witnesses said the\ntwo researchers focused on getting patients into the studies and\npaid minimal attention to their care.\n\n   To recruit the mostly male patients, they hired attractive young\nwomen, who later testified that they were paid bonuses that ran\ninto the thousands of dollars. According to testimony, one staffer\nwas given a Honda Accord for coaxing schizophrenia patients into\ntrials.\n\n   To earn these rewards, workers phoned and later met mentally ill\npatients who were stable and living in the community and offered\nthem $150 to check themselves into the VA hospital so they could be\nin a study. Patients already in locked wards were offered\ncigarettes for agreeing to participate.\n\n   ``When there is a possibility that you are going to get a car,\nyou're going to do whatever you can,'' study coordinator Angela\nTouhey told VA investigators.\n\n   Touhey and the other study coordinators, many of whom had no\nmedical training, determined whether a patient belonged in a study.\nAccording to an FDA investigation, untrained staff drew blood\nsamples and adjusted doses of the experimental drugs. Touhey said\nBorison and Diamond hardly saw patients during the trials. At one\nweekly meeting, Touhey said Diamond told the staff they weren't\ninterested in hearing about the patients.\n\n   ``Bruce told me, `We don't care about how the patients are\ndoing. We just want to know how many people you have enrolled in\nthe past week or couple of weeks,''' Touhey said.\n\n   The two researchers lived high, according to Georgia\nauthorities. They tucked away more than $5 million in cash and\nsecurities, drove Mercedes-Benz cars, and dropped more than\n$400,000 on antiques.\n\n   Borison bought medieval tournament armor from Sotheby's auction\nhouse in New York, and mahogany-paneled doors in London, for an\n11,000-square-foot castle that he was planning to build. The\nindictment charged that they bribed a staff member, Terri Davis, to\nkeep quiet after a schizophrenia patient in an olanzapine trial\nattempted suicide.\n\n   ``This whole thing was very dirty,'' Dr. David Hess, chief of\nneurology at the VA, told the hospital's investigators. ``It was\nbasically a numbers game. These patients are purely used for the\ngreed of the researchers. That was very apparent to me what was\ngoing on.''\n\n   Diamond and Borison are now behind bars. In December, 1997,\nDiamond pleaded guilty to theft and bribery charges and was\nsentenced to five years in prison, fined $125,000, and ordered to\npay $1.1 million to the college.\n\n   After one week of testimony at his trial in October, Borison\npleaded guilty to theft and a racketeering charge. He was sentenced\nto 15 years in prison, fined $125,000, and ordered to pay $4.26\nmillion to the college.\n\n     \n   \nResearcher caught\n\n   falsifying records\n\n     \n  \n\n   When the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice received\nallegations that Dr. Faruk Abuzzahab was endangering the welfare of\npatients in his general psychiatric practice, it hired Dr. Morris\nGoldman of the University of Chicago to investigate. One of the\nfirst things he discovered was that Abuzzahab was fudging records\nin order to put patients into lucrative drug studies.\n\n   ``He would have the patient's diagnosis called one thing in the\nregular chart, and then the person would be put on a drug study and\nthe person's diagnosis would be called something else to fit the\ncriteria,'' Goldman said in an interview.\n\n   In July, after Abuzzahab admitted to the board that he had\nentered ``disturbed and vulnerable'' patients into drug studies\neven though they didn't meet eligibility criteria, and had ``kept\nthem in the study after their conditions deteriorated,'' the\nmedical board suspended his license.\n\n   Among other things, Abuzzahab admitted that he cycled one woman\nwith paranoid schizophrenia through three drug trials from 1991 to\n1994, despite the fact that she did poorly on the experimental\ndrugs and complained of being a guinea pig. Eventually she became\ncatatonic and incontinent; she was then given standard therapies\nand responded well.\n\n   In another instance, the psychiatrist took a woman off\nclozapine, a newly approved drug that had led her to make a\nremarkable recovery, and enrolled her in a drug trial. The woman\nhad previously spent 13 years as an inpatient at a psychiatric\ninstitution, but while on clozapine she had been able to go into\nthe community and even hold a job. One day she approached Abuzzahab\nwith questions about clozapine's side effects; he immediately\nstopped the drug that had helped her so much and put her into an\nolanzapine trial. She deteriorated until she found her way to\nanother physician, who put her back on clozapine.\n\n   According to the state medical board, Susan Endersbe was another\npatient whom Abuzzahab ``recklessly'' entered into a clinical\ntrial. The doctor, the medical board noted, entered her into the\ntrial the first day he met her.\n\n   ``I think a key flaw in this whole thing is the financial\ngain,'' said Edward Endersbe. ``I am not a communist, but it is\nreally disturbing to see how much this is driven by financial gain,\nand that it can, and does, such harm. There is no question in my\nmind that that is what happened with my sister. My sister very much\nwanted to live and to be a survivor.''\n\n     \n   \nIncentives encourage\n\n   aggressive recruiting\n\n     \n  \n\n   Abuzzahab and Borison can be dismissed as isolated ``bad\napples'' who unfairly tarnish the image of all researchers who\nconduct schizophrenia drug trials. But the economic incentives they\npursued so eagerly are in play in all commercial drug testing.\n\n   Dr. Angela Bowen, president of the Western Institutional Review\nBoard, a commercial ethics review service, said researchers are\nbecoming more aggressive in their use of advertising to recruit\npatients into schizophrenia studies. Research centers that don't\nhave any ongoing studies have even submitted advertisements for IRB\napproval seeking depressed and schizophrenic patients who would\nconsent to being withdrawn from their medications, she said. The\nresearchers apparently wanted to develop a pool of mentally ill\npeople, already off standard therapies, who could be quickly\nenrolled once new drug contracts are secured.\n\n   ``We, of course, don't approve those ads,'' Bowen said. ``It\nboggles the mind.''\n\n   Aggressive recruitment of schizophrenic patients is problematic\nbecause participating in drug trials exposes them to the risk of\nrelapse and suffering. To determine whether a drug can curb\npsychosis, it must be tested in people who are actively psychotic.\nThat scientific standard, which is endorsed by the FDA, leads\nstraight into an ethical minefield.\n\n   One approach is for researchers to seek people who are already\nactively sick, either because they have stopped taking medication\non their own or because the symptoms aren't being adequately\ncontrolled by medication. But many of these patients suffer from\n``disorganized thoughts'' and some degree of psychosis, making it\nquestionable whether they can give meaningful informed consent.\n\n   Another route is to seek stable patients who are on medication.\nThese patients, however, must be hospitalized and their medications\nstopped in order for them to take part, with the expectation that\ntheir delusions and hallucinations will return. The patients must\nbecome sick again to be useful subjects.\n\n   ``If you don't take people who have reestablished active\ndisease, then you don't know what you are looking at'' when you\ntest the drug, said Robert Temple, associate director for medical\npolicy at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ``That\nis why you have to have a washout. And once you realize that you\nhave to do medication withdrawal, you have already gone into what\npeople are worried about, and that is giving a relapse.''\n\n   But Temple said the profession has not ``reached the conclusion\nthat allowing people to withdraw (from medication) is dangerous to\nthem, if they are closely monitored and well informed.''\n\n   If patients become too ill when their regular drug is stopped,\nresearchers may shorten the washout period. They then enter the\nactive part of the study and either receive the experimental drug,\na standard drug (usually Haldol), or an inactive placebo.\nResearchers will also use ``rescue medications'' if the patients\ndeteriorate too rapidly.\n\n   ``People do not have to become dramatically, floridly more\npsychotic in order to be ready to go into the study,'' said Nina\nSchooler, director of psychiatry research at Hillside Hospital, a\ndivision of Long Island Jewish Health System in Queens. ``We are\nnot talking about requiring dramatic psychotic relapse.''\n\n   Still, the essence of the process is to let the patients become\nsicker.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   However, the financial pressures and opportunities have been\nknown to lead physicians astray.
