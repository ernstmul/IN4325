Times News Service   \n\n   Ballplayers used to go to spring training to dry out, slim down\nand refocus their batting eyes. Those who didn't have to spend the\nwinter working in the local hardware store got fat on the\nrubber-chicken circuit telling stories about Mickey and Billy\ngetting lost in the woods with Jim Beam and rifles.\n\n   It seemed like a very good time because there were no free\nagents, designated hitters or mental patients in baseball, except\nfor Jimmy (``Fear Strikes Out'') Piersall, who was cured in the\nmovie. There was no Prozac or psychiatrists, and players who\ncrashed their cars, passed out drunk during communion breakfast\nspeeches or beat their wives were usually fined an autographed\nbaseball. We weren't advanced enough to be in denial.\n\n   Who knew how fouled up Mickey and Billy were? We do now, too\nlate for them, in a time when spring training looks like auditions\nfor the road show of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' The\ngeneral level of compassion in the pastime would please Nurse\nRatched.\n\n   Two players who could have used serious therapeutic help, Darryl\nStrawberry and John Rocker, have been suspended from the game.\nDarryl's yearlong suspension may be long enough so baseball won't\nhave to feel wistful about him anymore. Rocker's 73-day suspension\nwas reduced last week to 27 by an arbitrator, a just if irrelevant\ndecision. And then there's Bill Pulsipher, the Mets pitcher who\npassed out, according to most reports, from an overdose of dietary\nsupplements. Pulsipher was also taking Prozac.\n\n   Why? Could that antidepressant have had some effect?\n\n   Dr. Ronald L. Kamm, vice president of the International Society\nfor Sport Psychiatry, also wonders. ``We don't really know enough\nyet about drugs and the physiology of the elite athlete,'' he said\nlast week from his office in Oakhurst, N.J. ``How quickly do\nathletes metabolize drugs, how are drugs affected by adrenaline\nsurges and fluid loss?''\n\n   Kamm portrays psychiatric drugs not as performance enhancers but\nas ``performance enablers _ they can get an athlete back to who\nthey are. We need athletes to step forward and demystify the\ndrugs.''\n\n   The current most valuable patient is Julie Krone, who took\nZoloft for post-traumatic stress disorder that led to depression\nafter two serious race-track falls. She will be a lead speaker in\nMay in Chicago when the sports psychiatrists run a panel on\npsychopharmacological approaches to athletics and exercise at the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association's annual meeting. According to\nKamm, Krone has been an important _ albeit singular _ voice in the\nattempt to let athletes know about the values of psychiatric\nmedication while competing.\n\n   The sports industry tends to tolerate, often to continue to\npromote, athletes exhibiting symptoms of mental illness until their\nbox-office value depreciates or they become an embarrassment.\nStrawberry and Rocker have been crying out for help. (We're not\neven talking about psychopaths like Mike Tyson and Lawrence\nPhillips here.)\n\n   Just what responsibility do employers have toward the mental\nhealth of employees they pay to perform? When athletes ask for more\nmoney or pout in the clubhouse, management likes to tell the news\nmedia that they are, after all, still in adolescence. When athletes\nfall into real trouble, we are told that they are adults who should\nassume responsibility.\n\n   ``John Rocker is diagnosable,'' declares Dr. Richard Lustberg, a\nLong Island psychologist with a radio show and a Web site\n(www.psychologyofsports.com). ``He seems to be a person with low\nself-esteem trying to rise above feelings of insignificance. I\nthink he may be depressed. He runs on the field like a pumped-up\nWWF character without a script. He felt threatened by New York.''\n\n   Lustberg sees Rocker and Strawberry as good candidates for\npsychiatric drugs. He describes the Yankee slugger as a\n``vulnerable man who could not meet the demands of his environment;\nhe had poor boundaries, he acted out of emotional feelings and he\nlooked to sex for intimacy.''\n\n   Both players are under pressure from the news media, says\nLustberg, and from fans who themselves are in denial. ``Fans are\nbeing ripped off, but these are people paying for their own\nemotional experience,'' he said. ``Strawberry did nothing to them,\nyet they blame him. And Rocker ends up getting what he needs, which\nis a relationship with an entire city.''\n\n   Once Strawberry and Rocker are properly medicated by Kamm and\ntherapized by Lustberg, they can be referred to Dr. Nate Zinsser,\nthe director of applied sports psychology at West Point.\n\n   Zinsser originally called with some mild complaints about a\nrecent piece here on Dr. Michael Miletic, a Detroit-area\npsychiatrist who believes that the adaptation to early trauma is\none of the survival defenses that elite athletes use to reach high\nlevels of achievement. Zinsser thinks that approach is too focused\non pathology.\n\n   ``I'm sure the seeds of athletic success can be sown in\ntrauma,'' Zinsser said, ``but they're also sown in the joy of\ndiscovery, of finding something you are blessed with.''\n\n   While Miletic, who is also a psychoanalyst, is dealing with\nathlete-patients reluctant to deal with their unconscious,\nZinsser's patients are taught to ``just look and do,'' following\nthe more traditional sports counsel that analysis leads to\nparalysis.\n\n   ``Overthinking is often the problem,'' Zinsser said. ``Winning\nrequires some forgetfulness. Suppress negative emotions.\nConcentration, composure, confidence. Just look and swing!''\n\n   Zinsser takes a dim view of antidepressants, which he sees as a\n``quick fix,'' although he admits that they work. Which brings us\nback to Pulsipher. The last pitcher known to be on an\nantidepressant _ Pete Harnisch _ referred to his ``depressive\nepisode'' as ``a cold in my brain.'' Even during a 1998 interview\nthat the makers of Paxil had paid him to sit through, Harnisch told\nme that he was not comfortable with the term ``mental illness.''\nHis own explanation of the malady that caused him to sit out most\nof the 1997 season was that his body chemistry was destabilized\nwhen he abruptly quit a 13-year chewing tobacco habit during spring\ntraining.\n\n   Even as reluctant a role model as Harnisch proved to be, he is\nrare and courageous in sports, where the stigma of needing\nemotional help is so great that nothing happens until a Strawberry\novermedicates himself or a Rocker throws a tantrum for attention.\n\n   We need Julie Krone, who could teach all of us about bravery in\ncompetition, to ride in on this one.\n","Headline":"\nSPORTS COLUMN: PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION IS MOVING INTO THE LINEUP \n","Text":["\n   Ballplayers used to go to spring training to dry out, slim down\nand refocus their batting eyes.
