Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ A Bronx man who is suspected of leading one of the\nlargest black-market prescription drug operations in the state was\nindicted Friday after more than $1 million worth of prescription\nmedicine was found in his apartment, the authorities said.\n\n   The suspect, Elvin Mendez, 27, is accused of running the\noperation by buying prescription drugs from street-level dealers,\nstockpiling them and reselling large quantities to middlemen who\nthen sold them to pharmacies throughout the nation.\n\n   The street-level dealers typically either bought the drugs from\nMedicaid patients for a fraction of their cost, stole the drugs\nfrom hospitals or clinics, or enlisted the help of medical\nprofessionals who could write and fill prescriptions, the\nauthorities said.\n\n   Mendez was indicted after a six-month investigation in which\ninvestigators said they found plastic bags stuffed with AZT, the\nexpensive AIDS medication, and other drugs at his Bronx apartment\nlast spring.\n\n   Investigators from state Attorney General Dennis Vacco's\nMedicaid fraud unit also found a large number of empty prescription\nbottles, counterfeit drug manufacturers' labels, seals and\npackaging inserts, the attorney general's office said.\n\n   Mendez is charged with one count of criminal diversion of\nprescription medications and prescriptions in the second degree, a\nfelony, and faces up to seven years in prison if he is convicted.\nHe was arraigned in state Supreme Court in the Bronx and was being\nheld in $50,000 bail. Mendez has pleaded not guilty.\n\n   ``This increasingly common scam, known as drug diversion, costs\ntaxpayers millions of dollars,'' Vacco said, ``and also potentially\nplaces the public at great risk because the drugs that are diverted\nfrom regulated channels of distribution are often expired,\nmishandled and potentially unsafe.''\n\n   Mendez is accused of paying only a fraction of the cost for\npowerful drugs.
