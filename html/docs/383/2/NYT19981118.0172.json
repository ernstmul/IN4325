She\nadamantly objected to their plan to give her son, then 27, the\npsychostimulant. ``He is a hyperactive person. He has been that way\nall his life.''\n\n   But armed with Neil Post's signed consent forms, the researchers\nproceeded. After the second infusion of amphetamine, Post became\neven more restless, unable to sleep, and verbally abusive,\naccording to his medical record. His reaction was so acute that the\nthird infusion was never given. His behavior alternated between\n``modified catatonia'' and ``belligerent excitement.''\n\n   Post, now 41 and with a new diagnosis of autism, recalled he\ndidn't like the pills he was asked to take or the brain scans and\nother procedures he was asked to undergo in his two years in\nresearch. It was a painful period he'd rather not discuss.\n\n   Instead, he'd rather talk about making music, particularly\nplaying the steel drum. He is a member of Potential Unlimited, a\nnationally known group of performers with developmental\ndisabilities. He also plays lead pan, as the lead steel drum is\ncalled, for the Rhinebeck Central High School steel drum band in\nNew York, where he now lives, near his parents.\n\n   Chris Hart, a University of Maryland spokesman, said he cannot\ncomment on Post's care because ``we're always concerned about\nissues of patient confidentiality.'' Hart said the Maryland\nresearchers are not available to comment.\n\n   OPRR this year found the Maryland research center failed to\nfully disclose the risks of medication withdrawal, both in the\n1980s and today, and continues to have an open case against the\nfacility. It also cited the center for signing up people for too\nmany protocols at once. The investigation was prompted by testimony\nthat Beverly Post and another mother, Janice Becker, gave before a\npresidentially appointed ethics commission last year, about their\nchildren's experiences at the center.\n\n   But Hart said that the federal agency also found ``we're doing\nthings the right way.'' The institution has ``suffered a lot,'' he\nsaid, as a result of comments that cannot be countered because of\nconfidentiality restrictions.\n\n   Maryland's assistant dean for research, Anne Newman Hirshfield,\nsaid in a statement that ``we must stress that the OPRR's thorough\naudit did not reveal significant instances of noncompliance with\nregulations nor inadequate protection of human subjects. Several\nareas were identified where we could improve our practices, and we\nhave implemented those suggestions.''\n\n   She added that at her institution, ``we consider the protection\nof human subjects of utmost importance. Therefore, we were\nespecially gratified that the Maryland Psychiatric Research\nCenter's additional protections for human subjects were considered\nby the OPRR compliance site visitors to be `innovations (that) have\nthe potential to significantly enhance the informed-consent\nprocess.'''\n\n   In institutions across the country, others in a similarly\nfragile mental state have been asked to sign up for studies\ninvolving agents known to cause psychotic symptoms, according to\nthe Globe's review of the scientific literature.\n\n   At the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, for instance, 20\npatients who were hospitalized for ``acute exacerbation'' of their\nsymptoms were described as having given ``informed consent'' to a\nstudy. That research used intravenous methylphenidate, or Ritalin,\nto make ``possible the study of psychosis under controlled\nlaboratory conditions,'' according to the researchers' published\nreports in 1990 and 1991.\n\n   Half the patients experienced ``moderate to marked\ndeterioration,'' they noted, and two others became so psychotic\nthey could not finish the study.\n\n   And at Hillside Hospital, a division of Long Island Jewish\nMedical Center in New York, in long-running, federally funded\nresearch that ultimately enrolled 70 people newly diagnosed with\nschizophrenia, patients described as ``acutely psychotic'' were\nsaid to give informed consent to ``challenges'' using Ritalin,\naccording to research reports in the 1990s. Family members also\nreportedly gave consent. The medical center refused the Globe's\nrequest for copies of the consent forms.\n\n   Some Long Island mental health advocates apparently were never\ntold of the study, even though it had been ongoing for a decade and\nall newly admitted schizophrenic patients at one time were being\nasked to consent. Arnold Gould, who has a son with schizophrenia\nand who founded the Long Island chapter of the National Alliance\nfor the Mentally Ill in 1980, said he does not recall hearing about\nthe long-term study, even though the group meets regularly at the\nhospital. He doesn't think that researchers deliberately hid this\nresearch.\n\n   ``I suppose I didn't ask the right question,'' Gould said.\n\n     \n   \nResearchers defend methods\n\n   in challenge studies\n\n     \n  \n\n   Researchers involved in challenge studies say they can tell the\ndifference between psychotic patients who are able to give informed\nconsent and those who cannot, and that they also try to obtain\nconsent from family members.\n\n   ``You ask them questions, present information, and ask them to\nexplain to you their understanding of what has been communicated,''\nsaid Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, who headed up the Hillside Hospital\nstudy and is now a professor at the University of North Carolina in\nChapel Hill.\n\n   ``If you have psychotic symptoms, it doesn't mean incompetence.\nThey can still have the necessary cognitive wherewithal to\nunderstand what is being communicated to them and to determine the\nmeaning of things on a factually-accurate basis, even though they\nare undergoing symptoms that affect their attention and judgment.\nIt is a matter of magnitude.''\n\n   Dr. Paul Appelbaum of the University of Massachusetts Medical\nSchool, who has not done challenge studies himself but has\nresearched the ability of psychotic patients to consent, said\npatients who are having psychotic symptoms often can function\n``quite well'' in many areas of their lives.\n\n   ``They may have delusions and odd ideas about the CIA\ninvestigating their backgrounds, or the FBI trailing them on the\nstreet,'' he said. ``But that doesn't prevent them from\nunderstanding what they need to buy at the supermarket that night\nto make dinner, from understanding what is being proposed regarding\ntheir entering into a research study.''\n\n   Such statements fail to ring true for people who know firsthand\nwhat psychosis feels like, and for ethicists who say researchers\nhave an inherent conflict when it comes to judging capacity to\nconsent.\n\n   ``I was sick enough to be in the hospital. I was in danger. I\nwas in no frame of mind to be making such a major decision about my\nhealth,'' recalled Patricia Reynolds, who has bipolar disorder, or\nmanic depression, and was asked while she was having a major\ndelusional episode to enroll in a University of Cincinnati\ntreatment study in which some subjects received placebo pills\nrather than medication. ``I had signed the papers because my\nability to make a reasonable, rational decision had been altered.''\n\n   Reynolds said she left the hospital when she ``realized that I\nwas being treated like a laboratory rat.''\n\n   In any situation where acutely psychotic patients are asked to\nsign up for a study when they are expecting treatment, ``you'd be\ndeluding yourself if you were looking for real consent,'' said\nAlexander M. Capron, a University of Southern California professor\nand member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which is\nrenewing calls for research protections for the mentally ill.\n\n   Ethicists have a term to describe this problem with the way\nresearch is conducted: therapeutic misconception.\n\n   ``It almost becomes impossible for patients and doctors to\ndistinguish between therapy and experiments. They look at it as all\npart of treatment. That's a problem,'' said George Annas, chairman\nof the health law department at Boston University School of Public\nHealth. He served as consultant to the 1970s national commission\nthat first called for special research protections for the mentally\nill.\n\n   ``Physicians who are doing this stuff don't think they're doing\nbad things to people,'' he said. ``I don't think there are bad\npeople here. They want to do good. Patients want doctors to make\nthem better.''\n\n   But when scientists get caught up in the lofty goal of advancing\nresearch to benefit humankind, Annas said, ``they forget about the\nhumans right in front of them. They're overly enthusiastic. They\ncan't do both _ research and protect human subjects. They just\ncan't do it.''\n\n   Jay Katz, a professor emeritus of law, medicine, and psychiatry\nat Yale who has served on national commissions examining ethical\nconcerns raised by Tuskegee and the human radiation experiments,\nsaid the problem is a longstanding one.\n\n   ``The conflict ... is between the advancement of science and\nprotecting the inviolability of subjects of research,'' he said.\n``Scientists do have a tendency to make concessions ... of not\nprotecting fully the inviolability of subjects of research. That is\na conflict that has been with us since the beginning of medical\nscience.''\n\n     \n   \nConsent forms fall\n\n   short of full disclosure\n\n     \n  \n\n   Even if the competence of a mentally ill patient were not an\nissue, some consent forms clearly fail to fully disclose the risks\nand goals of the research.
