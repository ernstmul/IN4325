A second (risk) is that the patient could become more\nviolent and destructive to himself and to others. Third, people\nthink that acute psychosis does damage to the brain, and you want\nto limit those periods. Multiple episodes of acute psychosis lead\nto poorer long-term outcomes. You want to limit all of those things\nas much as possible.''\n\n   Stopping a schizophrenic patient's medication raises two other\nconcerns. In normal clinical care, when a patient is taken off\ndrugs, the recommended practice is to lower the dosage gradually,\nbecause abrupt withdrawal has been shown in numerous studies to\ndramatically increase the risk of relapse. Moreover, evidence is\nemerging that sudden withdrawal may lead to a rebound psychosis\nmore severe than if the patient had never been treated.\n\n   ``It is not simply a matter of not being treated and going back\nto baseline of an untreated state,'' said Dr. Ross Baldessarini,\nprofessor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.\n``There is an additional risk involved that may be due to the\ndiscontinuation itself .... We are trying to get people sensitized\nto this issue.''\n\n   David Cohen, a professor of social work at the University of\nMontreal who has done extensive research on neuroleptic drugs, said\nabrupt withdrawal can also lead to flu-like symptoms, nausea, and\nvomiting. This, he said, is a withdrawal reaction, not just a\nreturn of previous symptoms.\n\n   ``There will be new symptoms the person has never experienced\nbefore,'' Cohen added. ``But they don't tell them the kind of\nsuffering it will entail. They don't tell the patients how severe\nthese symptoms may be, and that they could be life threatening, and\nthat they could be driven to kill themselves.''\n\n   There are, of course, potential benefits for the research\nsubjects. The primary one is that they may respond to the\nexperimental drug, and be able to continue to get it by\nparticipating in a long-term followup study. But the mentally ill\npatients can expect, at least at first, to go through a difficult\nperiod.\n\n   ``I know that when I was three or four days into the washout I\nwas really struggling,'' said D.L., a 41-year-old woman in Illinois\ndiagnosed with mild psychotic disorder who recently entered a trial\nof an experimental antipsychotic. ``My symptoms increased\ndramatically. It was getting scary. If they had been any more\nsevere, I know that I couldn't have handled it. I hope that if that\nhad happened, I would not have hurt myself. But when you are\ndelusional, it is hard to know what you are going to do.''\n\n     \n   \nResearchers grapple with\n\n   ways to reduce patient risk\n\n     \n  \n\n   Within the psychiatric research community, there is controversy\nover whether drug studies can be designed to reduce the risk to\npatients. In Europe, for instance, researchers are reluctant to\nconduct placebo-controlled trials for schizophrenia. Instead,\nEuropean researchers usually conduct trials that compare the\nexperimental drug to a standard therapy.\n\n   That is also how US drug trials are typically designed for\nmedical conditions such as high blood pressure, for which there are\nalready effective approved drugs. But in schizophrenia research,\nthe FDA believes that patients' reactions to antipsychotic drugs\nare so variable that without a placebo group, the tests cannot show\nwhether an experimental drug is effective. That could result in\nineffective drugs being approved, said the FDA's Temple.\n\n   ``You have to think about the people in the trial, but you also\nhave to think of the consequences to the community of marketing\nineffective antipsychotics,'' he said.\n\n   Others find that justification unsatisfying.\n\n   ``Can you imagine an antibiotic study that would compare the\nexperimental drug to a sugar pill?'' asked Unfried, head of the\nalliance of for-profit research centers. ``Can you imagine that\ngoofy study? With the result that the patient died from too much\ninfection? In those studies, you use a standard therapy as a basis\nfor comparison. The FDA has a role to protect people and to make\nsure you design the trial in such a way that you do not hurt\npeople.''\n\n     \n   \nTesting violations lead\n\n   to a death in California\n\n     \n  \n\n   Anyone agreeing to take part in a risky drug trial would expect\nattentive medical care. But that wasn't the case with Borison and\nDiamond. It wasn't the case with Abuzzahab. And it was not what\nJennifer Abigayle McIntyre received when she entered a trial in\n1993 for Janssen Pharmaceutica's experimental drug risperidone.\n\n   After she died, an investigation by the California Department of\nHealth found violations that took 16 pages to detail.\n\n   In the spring of 1993, Abigayle's mother, psychiatrist Judith\nVukov, accompanied Dr. Robert Liberman, director of schizophrenia\nresearch at the University of California, Los Angeles, to lobby\nCongress to fund research on mental illness. Her daughter had\nschizoaffective disorder (a variant of schizophrenia), existing\nmedications weren't helping her, and, as Liberman had told her,\nexperimental treatments offered the best hope.\n\n   Later that same summer, on July 20, 1993, according to the\nCalifornia Department of Health and court records, Abigayle\nMcIntyre was transferred to the research ward at Camarillo State\nHospital, where doctors were treating patients with experimental\nprotocols developed by UCLA researchers.\n\n   Abigayle signed an informed-consent form that stated she would\nbe given a physical exam, be closely monitored, and that if her\ncondition worsened, her treatment would be ``promptly adjusted.''\nIn fact, the investigation showed, she never received a physical,\nnor did the staff prepare any plan for treating her psychiatric and\nbehavioral problems.\n\n   The principal researcher, Dr. Barringer Marshall Jr., gave her a\nnew diagnosis, chronic schizophrenia, which made her eligible for\nthe risperidone study.\n\n   As her previous medications were withdrawn, she became more\nvolatile, crying and screaming for hours on the phone with her\nmother. On Aug. 12, as part of the protocol, she was prescribed\nHaldol, a standard antipsychotic. Even though she began to suffer\nterrible headaches and her blood pressure soared, she was kept on\nHaldol. The protocol called for her to take the drug for three\nweeks before she could be switched to risperidone.\n\n   Her mother complained, but to no avail.\n\n   ``Just because I am a doctor doesn't mean anything,'' Vukov\nsaid. ``If you have a psychiatric child, your opinion is useless.''\n\n   The last time the unit's staff made an entry on Abigayle's chart\nwas Aug. 26. On Sept. 11, her mother took her out of the hospital\non a day pass. At some point her daughter swallowed a large number\nof aspirin; she died several hours later after emergency room\nphysicians failed to promptly diagnose the aspirin poisoning.\n\n   ``I thought research was the best treatment in the country,''\nsaid Vukov. ``Today it is not. It is the most dangerous. Abigayle\nwouldn't have gotten sick like that if she hadn't been in research.\nShe ended up outside my control and outside the control of a good\ndoctor, who would have done something about (her illness). She was\nactively neglected in research.''\n\n     \n   \nMessy picture often\n\n   buried in a marketing glow\n\n     \n  \n\n   When a drug company submits data to the FDA, it must detail all\ndeaths that occurred in the clinical trials, along with a full\naccounting of side effects, patients who dropped out of the study,\nand any other problems suffered by the patients.\n\n   But that often messy picture is rarely reflected in the accounts\nof the drug's performance that get published in medical journals.\n\n   Zeneca's Seroquel, approved by the FDA last fall, is the newest\nantipsychotic drug on the market. When the Globe compared the mixed\nresults hidden in FDA files, including 14 deaths, with the glowing\nconclusions published in medical journals, the differences were\nstark.\n\n   According to the FDA's review of Zeneca's data, 80 percent of\nthe 2,162 patients given Seroquel in clinical tests stopped taking\nthe drug before the trial was over, even though the trials often\nlasted less than eight weeks. Of those who dropped out, 1,033 did\nso because the drug didn't help them, 398 simply refused to\ncontinue or were lost to follow-up, and 86 had to stop because of\nadverse reactions that included excess sleepinees, convulsions,\nsuicide attempts, and depression.\n\n   But when articles began appearing in medical journals on the\nresults in the summer of 1997, the authors glossed over the\ndropouts, failed to report on the deaths, and drew rosy\nconclusions. An article in the Archives of General Psychiatry\nhailed Seroquel as ``an effective antipsychotic with a favorable\nsafety profile''; a report in Biological Psychiatry touted the drug\nas ``well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of\nschizophrenia.''\n\n   ``Most of the trial results that are published have as authors\nboth (researchers) and people involved with the trial who work for\nthe company,'' noted New York-based researcher Schooler, who Zeneca\ndesignated to be its spokesperson. ``Of course people put the most\npositive spin possible on their results.''\n\n   One result of this marketing spin is that practicing\npsychiatrists often say they no longer know what to believe about\nnew drugs.
