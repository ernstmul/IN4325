KNOX  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   BOSTON _ Dr. Jonathan O. Cole, a Harvard psychiatrist who was\none of the first to suggest that Prozac and similar antidepressants\ncould precipitate suicide, is now criticizing drug companies and\nthe US Food and Drug Administration, saying they are failing to\ntake the problem seriously.\n\n   Cole made his complaint in support of a federal court lawsuit\nthat claims the drug Zoloft, a chemical cousin of Prozac, caused a\n13-year-old Kansas City youth to kill himself.\n\n   ``I still believe our 1990 article was correct and it does\nhappen,'' Cole said of the alleged suicide-antidepressant link that\nhe and other McLean Hospital researchers first suggested a decade\nago.\n\n   Although Cole had remained silent amid manufacturers' efforts to\ndiscredit his research, the Boston psychiatrist said he was angered\nby the actions of Zoloft's maker, Pfizer Inc., in fighting the\nlawsuit brought by the family of Matthew Miller, the Missouri\nteenager.\n\n   The youth had been taking Zoloft for only a week when he hanged\nhimself in his bedroom closet on July 28, 1997. His parents insist\nhe had never displayed suicidal tendencies and had never been\ntreated for behavioral problems. They say the boy had been\nunusually restless and jumpy in the days before his death _\nsymptoms that Cole and other researchers say are warning signs of\nalleged antidepressant-related suicides.\n\n   ``Against this background . . . There is a clear prima facie\ncase that Zoloft caused Matthew Miller to commit suicide,'' said\nDr. David Healy, a British researcher who is the family's chief\nexpert witness.\n\n   Pfizer lawyers, calling Healy a practitioner of ``junk\nscience,'' are asking Kansas City Federal District Court Judge\nKatheryn Vratil to disallow Healy as an expert witness. Cole was\nrecruited by the Houston law firm representing the Miller family to\nvouch for Healy's scientific rigor.\n\n   Pfizer representatives say there is no credible scientific\nevidence that Zoloft and related drugs precipitate suicide. Company\nofficials did not return telephone calls Friday seeking comment.\n\n   In the decade since Cole and Harvard colleagues first reported\non early cases of extreme agitation among people taking Prozac and\nrelated antidepressants, use of these drugs _ called selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs _ has reached 84 million\nprescriptions a year.\n\n   The wholesale cost of SSRI prescriptions last year was $7\nbillion, a 15 percent jump from 1998, according to IMS Health, a\nPennsylvania research firm.\n\n   Moreover, US physicians are prescribing Prozac, Zoloft, and a\nrelated drug called Paxil for ever-younger patients and for a\nbroadening list of disorders.\n\n   A University of Michigan researcher reported Friday in Boston\nthat nearly 2 percent of North Carolina children ages 6 to 14\nreceived SSRI drugs in 1998. A growing number of physicians are\ngiving children prescriptions for SSRIs along with stimulants such\nas Ritalin, the researcher said, despite the absence of any studies\nsupporting such use.\n\n   Dr. Jerry Rushton and his colleagues found that Prozac, Zoloft,\nand Paxil are being used widely by children not only for\ndepression, but for school phobia, anxiety disorders, bed-wetting,\neating disorders, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.\nTheir study was presented at the annual meeting of the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Academic Societies.\n\n   While manufacturers have been successful so far in deflecting\ncriticism, opponents say the tide may be turning, due to lawsuits,\nmedia reports, books, and statements from prominent scientists such\nas Cole.\n\n   The Globe reported a week ago that Eli Lilly and Co., the maker\nof Prozac, was aware more than a decade ago that suicidal thoughts\noccurred in as many as 1 percent of patients who were given the\ndrug in early trials. Furthermore, the patent for a new form of\nProzac, invented by physicians at McLean Hospital in Belmont and\nscientists at Marlborough-based Sepracor Inc., specifically\nmentions suicide as a possible side effect of the original Prozac.\nLily has embraced the new Prozac and plans to market it within two\nyears.\n\n   ``I have seen patients and reviewed cases where an SSRI\nunmistakably precipitated a driven preoccupation with suicide,''\nsaid Cole, 74.\n\n   Such responses are unusual, Cole said, but they should be taken\nmore seriously by manufacturers and federal regulators. ``It's a\nrelatively small problem, but it exists,'' he said in an interview.\n\n   The problem, critics say, is that infrequent adverse effects are\nmagnified when millions of people take a drug every day. ``I sense\nthe scientific community is beginning to understand they made a\nmistake in concluding that they could rule out suicide as an\nadverse effect'' from SSRI drugs, said Thomas J. Moore, a drug\nindustry critic at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\n   Nobody knows how many suicides have occurred among the millions\nof people who have taken SSRI antidepressants. Richard Ewing, a\nlawyer in a firm representing the Miller family, said the FDA had\nrecorded about 2,000 suicides between 1988 and 1997 that may have\nbeen related to the drugs, but says the agency acknowledges that\nthis is a small fraction of the probable cases.\n\n   Healy, the British researcher, has estimated that as many as\n50,000 suicides worldwide may be related to the drugs' use.\n\n   Cole cited two studies by Texas researchers in 1993 and 1995\nsuggesting that about 1 in 200 patients reported having new\nsuicidal thoughts while on Prozac, while none did while taking an\nolder non-SSRI drug.\n\n   This rate ``sounds about right to me,'' Cole said. It's ``rare\nenough to make most physicians not notice the effect, but common\nenough to cause serious adverse effects, such as death by suicide,\nin a few patients,'' he said.\n\n   But Cole said no one has done the large-scale studies necessary\nto pin down the frequency of SSRI-related suicides. Such studies\nare not easy to do, since suicides are uncommon events even among\nclinically depressed people and researchers must distinguish those\nrelated to the underlying depression from those preceded by the\nextreme agitation, called akathisia.\n\n   ``Although the manufacturers of SSRI drugs could and should have\ndone these studies, to my knowledge no manufacturer of an SSRI drug\nhas ever done a study where the primary outcome of interest was to\nmeasure . . . suicidality'' that emerged during treatment, Cole\nsaid in a document filed with the federal court Friday.\n\n   Cole also said an FDA advisory panel convened in 1991 to\nconsider the alleged SSRI-suicide link ``never came to grips with\nthe reality or non-reality of the phenomenon.''\n\n   But other researchers defend drug manufacturers and federal\nofficials for the way they have responded to studies suggesting a\nsuicide link. These include Dr. Anthony J. Rothschild of the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School, who coauthored a 1991\nstudy that the SSRI critics cite as evidence of a suicide problem.\n\n   Rothschild and his colleagues administered Prozac to three\npatients who had attempted suicide and found they developed severe\nagitation and suicidal thoughts once again. Those symptoms subsided\nwhen Prozac was withdrawn or when the drug was countered by one\nwith calming effects, according to the study.\n\n   But Rothschild said he thinks Eli Lilly and Co., Prozac's\nmanufacturer, and the FDA ``adequately addressed'' the concerns.\n\n   ``The thing that disturbs me'' about current SSRI critics,\nRothschild said, ``is the tone that suggests there's almost a\nconspiracy to cover up information and not do the right studies.''\n","Headline":"\nDOCTOR LASHES OUT IN PROZAC BATTLE \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Dr. Jonathan O.
