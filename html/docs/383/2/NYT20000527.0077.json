The key symposium for me, numbingly\nentitled, ``Psychopharmacological Approaches to the Athletic and\nExercise Population,'' was provocative and groundbreaking, and\npoorly attended. Just as psychiatry has yet to crack SportsWorld's\ntaboos against athletes appearing emotionally needy, so jock\nculture has yet to become an area of serious study in ShrinkWorld.\n\n   But Dr. Ronald Kamm of New Jersey, who led the symposium, thinks\nthat a bridge between the two worlds can be built by the likes of\nJulie Krone, the recently retired Hall of Fame jockey; Cincinnati\nReds pitcher Pete Harnisch; and Jack Farrell, a champion skeet\nshooter, talking unselfconsciously about their therapy and\npsychiatric drugs. They were all paid by the drug companies to talk\nabout their experiences.\n\n   Harnisch was in spring training with the Mets in 1997 when he\nbecame depressed. Interviewed by Kamm in a 16-minute video,\nHarnisch said that Mets management responded poorly to his illness,\nbut that after seven months of talk therapy and antidepressants (he\nstarted with Prozac, was helped by Paxil) he got his game back.\nSince then, he said, a number of players have approached him for\nadvice and to share stories.\n\n   Farrell, 67, a retired engineer, went into depression after he\nquit smoking cigarettes. Anger management was one of his main\nproblems, he said; Paxil made him a better shooter because ``I'm\ncalmer and I don't flinch.''\n\n   Krone's story of her reluctance to ask for help even after she\nfelt suicidal and her eventual return to self after talk therapy\nand Zoloft evoked dozens of phone calls and e-mail messages to\nthelipsite(at)aol.com. Most were from other athletes, elite and\nrecreational, sharing their stories. They were thrilled that she\ncalled her condition a ``mental illness,'' a step toward\nde-stigmatizing it. There were quibbles. A noted\npsychopharmacologist, Dr. Arthur Rifkin of Hillside Hospital in\nQueens, N.Y., thought that two years of talk therapy before taking\ndrugs was too long (Krone's psychiatrists had vainly urged her to\nstart sooner). Bob Carolla of the National Alliance for the\nMentally Ill pointed out that the football players Alonzo Spellman\nand Earl Campbell have also spoken out publicly about their\nillnesses.\n\n   The Chicago symposium was sponsored by the International Society\nfor Sport Psychiatry, a nine-year-old group of about 80 members\nsearching for its place in an arena dominated by the aggressive\nmarketing of psychologists who promise to raise your batting\naverage and lower your golf score. In papers that were presented,\nDr. Antonia Baum of George Washington University, Dr. Ira Glick of\nStanford and Dr. Robert Burton of Northwestern called for research\ninto the effect of psychiatric drugs on ``finely tuned'' elite\nathletes, and a re-examination of the banning of substances that\nmight treat mood or anxiety disorders. Burton is also co-editor,\nwith Dr. Daniel Begel, of the newly published book ``Sport\nPsychiatry'' (Norton).\n\n   A sexier symposium, on Coach Knight or even Latrell Sprewell,\nmight have drawn better against such competing offerings at the\nsame time that night as the movies ``Life is Beautiful'' and ``Good\nWill Hunting,'' followed by psychiatric evaluations. And a\nKnight-Spree entry might have been more on the mark; the emotional\nimpact of jock culture is incalculable.\n\n   Even if there was an independent body of SportsWorld therapists\navailable to help the needy, one can assume that neither Knight nor\nIndiana would sit for a session. Psychiatrists tend to be too lofty\nto give distant diagnoses, probably a good thing, but some general\nspeculation about Knight's lack of control (or calculated use of\nabuse?) might be instructive. There is good video available.\n\n   No video exists of Sprewell choking P.J. Carlesimo, but that\nwould have been a perfect episode for analysis, assuming the\nNational Basketball Association could stand the psychiatric\nspotlight on what might have been the case of an emotionally\ntroubled player pushed too far by a coach with unresolved issues of\nhis own.   \n  \n","Headline":"\nSPORTS COLUMN: SPORTSWORLD, MEET SHRINKWORLD \n","Text":["\n   Because our Bob Knight problem was framed as either a moral\nquestion _ Is it wrong to throw chairs, talk dirty and choke your\nplayers? _ or as a pragmatic question _ Is it imprudent for a\nuniversity president to jeopardize major donations by dumping an\niconic coach? _ we will probably have to deal with the blustery\nbully for a while.
