And while the study focused on\nantidepressants and antipsychotics, its authors say the disparity\nin prices likely is as stark for antibiotics, heart drugs, and\nother medications.\n\n   ``There are thousands of people, if not tens of thousands, for\nwhom the impact of this price gouging is that they don't get\ntreated,'' said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's\nHealth Research Group, a Washington nonprofit that conducted the\nstudy.\n\n   But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers Association of America, said that ``our companies\ntake on the extraordinary risk of drug discovery because the\nAmerican free-market system offers incentives and potential\nrewards. In other countries around the world, especially Europe,\nwhen the free market is stifled by price controls or patent piracy,\nthe lights in the laboratories go out.''\n\n   The Public Citizen study was prompted by anecdotal reports of\nbig gaps in drug prices between Europe and America, said Dr. E.\nFuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and one of the authors. The reports\ndealt with the new generation of drugs to treat mental illness, he\nadded, and since his organization long has been concerned about\nproblems of the mentally ill, he and others decided to run an\nin-depth study.\n\n   Five antidepressants and three antipsychotic drugs were selected\nfor the survey, and the costs to pharmacists in the United States,\nCanada, Mexico, and 14 European countries were compared for an\naverage 30-day supply of each medication available there. The\nfindings were dramatic: For most drugs in most countries there was\na relatively narrow cost difference. The big exception was the\nUnited States.\n\n   The widely touted antidepressent fluoxetine (Prozac), for\ninstance, cost an average of $317.03 in America and $111.20 on\naverage in the 16 other countries. Fluvoxamine (Luvox), used to\ntreat obsessive-compulsive disorders, was 2.3 times more expensive\nhere, while clozapine (Clozaril), used for schizophrenia, cost 2.9\ntimes more.\n\n   Why the huge differences?\n\n   All the other countries have national health insurance of some\nform, which gives them clout in negotiations with big\npharmaceutical companies, the study authors say. That same clout\napplies in the United States in the case of agencies, such as the\nVeterans Administration, that get drugs at prices as low as those\nin Europe.\n\n   The manufacturers of the drugs studied earned more than $12\nbillion annually in profits in recent years.\n\n   ``In the United States they basically can charge what the market\nwill bear,'' said Torrey. ``These are not drugs just to enhance the\nquality of your life, like Viagra. These are drugs people need to\nnot be suicidal, to not be homeless.''\n\n   Gerald Tarutis, a board member of the National Alliance for the\nMentally Ill, was equally alarmed by the findings. ``Why should the\nsame product cost twice as much in this country as it does in\nEuropean countries?'' he asked. ``That's not fair.''\n\n   But Holmer, whose group represents the makers of the eight drugs\nstudied and the rest of the US pharmaceutical industry, said that\nsome of the price differences may be a result of the\nnewly-strengthened position of the US dollar, differences in costs\nof living in countries studied, variations in medical practices,\nand other methodological issues involved in the Public Citizen\nstudy.\n\n   Price controls like those in the other countries, he added,\n``are a dagger aimed at the hearts of America's patients. If price\ncontrols are imposed there will be less investment in research and\ndevelopment and far fewer new cures and treatments.''\n\n   Wolfe, however, said that drug companies ``use research\nblackmail to cover everything. ...
