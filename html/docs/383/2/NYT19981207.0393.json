FISHER   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Eli Lilly & Co. said Monday that it would pay Sepracor Inc. up\nto $90 million to license a molecule that is a purer form of\nProzac, Lilly's market-leading anti-depressant.\n\n   Sepracor, based in Marlborough, Mass., will also receive an\nundisclosed royalty on sales of the drug, R-fluoxetine, which is\nexpected to have fewer side effects than Prozac.\n\n   Analysts said the deal would benefit both companies. For Lilly,\nR-fluoxetine could extend the competitive life of Prozac, its\nbiggest drug, which could face an onslaught of generic versions\nwhen its patents begin expiring in 2001.\n\n   For Sepracor, the deal brings a welcome influx of cash, a\npotentially large contributor to revenue and a validation of its\nstrategy of developing improved drugs based on existing ones.\nSepracor's patents on R-fluoxetine run until 2015.\n\n   Shares of Sepracor fell $3.125, to $84.875, after hitting a\nmidday high of $95.25 in Nasdaq trading. Lilly rose 81.25 cents, to\n$86.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the deal\nhad been expected and was already reflected in the strong\nperformance of Sepracor's shares in recent months.\n\n   R-fluoxetine is in the first of the three phases of human\nclinical trials typically required by the Food and Drug\nAdministration for the approval of new drugs. Lilly said that it\nhoped to complete clinical trials by 2001 and that it would file\nfor regulatory approval at that time.\n\n   ``R-fluoxetine is an exciting molecule with a good chance of\nbecoming an important new advance in treating depression,'' Sidney\nTaurel, Lilly's president and chief executive, said in a statement.\n\n   ``This licensing agreement with Sepracor, coupled with our\ninternal progress in developing new anti-depressants, will enable\nLilly to introduce new and advanced treatments for this\ndebilitating illness and to build upon our leadership position in\nneuroscience products,'' he said.\n\n   Lilly said animal studies showed R-fluoxetine had the potential\nto offer greater flexibility in treating depression and to provide\ntreatment benefits for more patients than most currently available\nanti-depressants, including Prozac.\n\n   Introduced more than 10 years ago, Prozac was the first of a\nfamily of anti-depressants known as selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors, which also includes Zoloft, made by Pfizer Inc., and\nPaxil, made by SmithKline Beecham PLC.\n\n   Although safer and more effective than earlier drugs for\ndepression, Prozac and its competitors do have side effects,\nincluding sexual dysfunction and jittery nerves. Nevertheless, the\ndrugs are a huge category, with Prozac alone producing worldwide\nsales of approximately $2.6 billion in 1997.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Founded in 1984, Sepracor developed a technology to exploit the\ncentury-old discovery that most chemicals are formed with two\nmirror-image compounds, called isomers. For most drugs, only one\nside of the pair is active, and the other may cause side effects.\nBy isolating the active isomer, Sepracor can develop a safer or\nmore effective drug.\n\n   Sepracor patented the isomeric forms of many leading drugs\nbefore their manufacturers devised ways to copy its technology.\n\n   Most of those companies have been willing to license the\nimproved version of the drug from Sepracor; the most successful to\ndate is Hoechst Marion Rousell's antihistamine Allegra, which\nreplaced Seldane after that drug was found to cause cardiac damage\nin some patients. Sepracor is also awaiting FDA approval for an\nimproved version of albuterol, a common asthma drug.\n\n   ``The basic strategy of Sepracor is low risk,'' said Sergio\nTraversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``When you have behind\nyou Johnson & Johnson, Schering Plough and Lilly, you're pretty\nsafe,'' he said. ``If you look at the list of drugs they have under\ndevelopment, it's very, very long. This is just the beginning of\nthe story.''\n","Headline":"\nELI LILLY TO PAY SEPRACOR TO LICENSE DRUG \n","Text":["\n   Eli Lilly & Co. said Monday that it would pay Sepracor Inc. up\nto $90 million to license a molecule that is a purer form of\nProzac, Lilly's market-leading anti-depressant.\n","\n   Sepracor, based in Marlborough, Mass., will also receive an\nundisclosed royalty on sales of the drug, R-fluoxetine, which is\nexpected to have fewer side effects than Prozac.\n","\n   Analysts said the deal would benefit both companies.
