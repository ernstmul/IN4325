There is\nmuch experimentation that does not put mentally ill subjects at\nrisk of harm, conducted by physicians who take pains to ensure that\nsubjects know what they're getting into.\n\n   But there is no similar type of experimentation, in which\npatients' symptoms are deliberately exacerbated for research\npurposes only, on people of sound mind.\n\n   ``We let researchers do things to people with mental illness\nthat we would never let them do to people with physical illness,''\nsaid George Annas, chairman of the Health Law Department at Boston\nUniversity School of Public Health.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Schizophrenia resists\n\n   divulging its secrets\n\n     \n  \n\n   As researchers note, schizophrenia is a poorly understood\nillness that has resisted giving up its secrets. It afflicts about\none in every 200 adults, typically beginning in early adulthood.\nThe disease brings on delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre\nthoughts (called positive symptoms) and often a striking lack of\noutward emotion and extreme social withdrawal (negative symptoms).\nIt has no consistent course. Some experience an initial psychotic\nepisode and never relapse; others relapse repeatedly as the disease\nbecomes chronic.\n\n   Symptom-exacerbation experiments were pioneered by Dr. David\nJanowsky of Vanderbilt University. In 1974, he reported success in\ndeveloping a new tool for studying schizophrenia. He found that\ngiving schizophrenic patients methylphenidate (Ritalin) caused ``a\ndramatic intensification of preexisting symptoms, such as\nhallucinations and delusions,'' and that amphetamine also\nexacerbated their psychosis. Both drugs are known to release\ndopamine, a messenger chemical in the brain, and Janowsky's\nexperiments provided indirect evidence that the biological\nmechanism of psychosis involved an overactive dopamine system.\n\n   His work also established the idea that psychosis-inducing drugs\ncould be used as ``challenge agents'' to turn patients into models\nfor studying psychotic illnesses.\n\n   ``They are uniquely human conditions and there is no animal\nmodel for developing treatments,'' said Dr. Stephen Strakowski,\nassociate professor of psychiatry at University of Cincinnati\nMedical School, who has used amphetamine as a challenge agent.\n``Challenge tests are used to understand complex disorders, and\nwithout them, we would lose a significant way to do that.''\n\n   In the past decade, researchers have turned to new types of\npsychostimulants to conduct these studies. Their findings,\nresearchers say, may lead to better drugs. It is this prospect,\nthey say, that justifies risks to patients, and the psychic\ndistress they may suffer.\n\n   The researchers also say the psychotic symptoms they induce are\ntransient, usually lasting only a few hours, and generally cause\npatients only modest discomfort.\n\n   ``What we are talking about is very short-lived increases in\nsymptoms that patients have experienced over years and decades,''\nsaid Dr. David Shore, associate director for clinical research at\nNIMH, where ketamine-challenge experiments are underway. ``To say\nthat increasing a particular symptom _ like hearing voices for a\ncouple of hours in somebody who has been hearing voices for 10\nyears _ is causing (suffering) rather seems like a stretch.''\n\n   Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, who conducted methylphenidate challenge\ntests for more than a decade at Hillside Hospital, a division of\nLong Island Jewish Medical Center in New York, acknowledged that\nthe induced symptoms are sometimes ``scary and very unpleasant.''\nSome patients get worse, he said, ``but in my experience, the\nsymptoms never exceeded the range of severity that occurred in the\ncourse of their illness previously.''\n\n   Dr. Paul Appelbaum, chairman of the psychiatry department at the\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School, said challenge studies\ncan be justified ``if the question researchers seek to answer is an\nimportant one'' and the research subjects have given ``good\nconsent, adequate consent.'' Even the use of a drug like ketamine\ncan be justified, he said, as long as patients have given informed\nconsent.\n\n   ``The investigators (using ketamine) are quite persuasive, from\nmy discussions, that they are not causing outrageous levels of\nharm,'' Appelbaum said.\n\n   But a different view emerges from the researchers' own medical\njournal reports, from people who suffer from mental illness, and\nfrom families of patients who have been in such studies. They tell\nof fragile minds filled with pain and suffering, and of lives made\nworse.\n\n   The scientific literature provides a few glimpses of individual\npatients. This 1987 account by researchers at the National\nInstitute of Mental Health describes a patient with bipolar\ndisorder who was injected with methylphenidate: ``Within a few\nminutes after the infusion, Mr. A experienced nausea and motor\nagitation. Soon thereafter he began thrashing about uncontrollably\nand appeared to be very angry, displaying facial grimacing,\ngrunting and shouting ... 15 minutes after the infusion, he\nshouted, `It's coming at me again, like getting out of control.\nIt's stronger than I am.' He slammed his fists into the bed and\ntable and implored us not to touch him, warning that he might\nbecome assaultive. Gradually over the next half hour, Mr. A calmed\ndown and began to talk about his experience.''\n\n   That is what outside observers could see. Those who have lived\nthrough psychotic episodes describe an interior landscape that can\nbe filled with fear and terror as delusions and hallucinations\nbecome more florid.\n\n   ``When you are psychotic, there are a lot of unusual processes\ngoing on,'' said Michael Susko of Baltimore, who suffered a\npsychotic break when he was 25 years old. He is editor of a book\nabout schizophrenia, ``Cry of the Invisible.''\n\n   ``You might be having death experiences, feeling like you are\ndying and melting,'' he said. ``You give somebody a drug that\namplifies that, you run the risk of overwhelming them. It's like a\nbad trip.''\n\n   Franklin Marquit, founder of the National Artists for Mental\nHealth, has suffered from a variety of mental illnesses, including\nmanic depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder. Last fall, in preparation for a hearing held by the New\nYork State Department of Health, he gathered opinions from 25\nmental health ``consumers,'' including some with psychotic\ndisorders, on symptom-exacerbation experiments. All objected\nvigorously to the idea that such studies present little danger or\ncause only minimal discomfort.\n\n   ``Have it done to yourself and see how the symptoms are,''\nMarquit said. ``Someone who doesn't experience this traumatizing\nfeeling, how would they know? With panic disorder, I feel like\njumping off the edge of the earth at times, it is so bad. I can't\nimagine the rationale for exacerbating symptoms, especially a brain\nsymptom. If a person had an arrhythmia problem, would you speed the\nheart up and say that it is OK because they are used to it?''\n\n   Whether symptom-exacerbation experiments and the cutoff of\nantipsychotic medication that often accompanies such research cause\nlong-term harm is a thorny issue. Although these experiments have\nbeen ongoing for 25 years, the question hasn't been studied.\n\n   Researchers argue that the temporary increase in psychosis does\nnot amount to a relapse. Although they acknowledge there is a\ngrowing suspicion that acutely psychotic episodes may be toxic to\nthe brain, causing a type of scarring of neurons, they do not\nbelieve exacerbation experiments are likely to trigger such damage.\n\n   ``There is a risk there,'' said Dr. Stephan Taylor, assistant\nprofessor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, who has used\nchallenge agents to study anxiety and post-traumatic stress\ndisorder. ``My sense is that the sort of psychosis that reaches a\ntoxic level is much more significant than what a few doses of\namphetamine will produce. It's a fairly small risk.''\n\n   The ultimate question, however, is how exacerbation experiments\ncan be reconciled with a standard of good medical care that runs\ncontrary to such practices. Psychiatrists agree that patients do\nbest when physicians catch the psychosis at an early stage and\nquickly curb their delusions and hallucinations with medications.\nRelapse, often defined as a return of even moderate psychosis, is\nseen as a life-threatening event that needs to be prevented. Most\nclinicians believe that repeated relapses, particularly for a\nperson early in the course of the illness, lead to a worse\nlong-term outcome.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   _There is evidence in researchers' sworn testimony, written\ncorrespondence, citations by the federal Office of Protection from\nResearch Risks, and patients' own accounts that investigators have\nroutinely failed to fully disclose the true purposes of their\nexperiments, and withheld information about risks.\n","\n   The Globe's review of informed-consent forms for\nsymptom-exacerbation studies at the NIMH and four other leading\npsychiatric institutions failed to turn up a single one in which\nthe researchers directly stated that a chemical agent would be used\npurposely to exacerbate psychotic symptoms.\n","\n   When in 1993 researchers at the University of Maryland began\ninjecting schizophrenic patients with ketamine, the consent form\nsaid only that the experiment's purpose was ``to study a medication\nnamed ketamine for schizophrenia.''\n","\n   OPRR, the federal agency charged with protecting research\nsubjects, has found fault with informed consent practices of\npsychiatric researchers at the University of Maryland; the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles; and the National Institute\nof Mental Health, and has ongoing investigations of the Bronx\nVeterans Affairs Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric\nInstitute, and the University of Cincinnati.\n","\n   Such practices do not typify all psychiatric research.
