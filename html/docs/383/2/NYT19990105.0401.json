(fb) \nBy DENISE GRADY    \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it\nhad approved two drugs already used in people as the first\ntreatments ever marketed specifically to treat mental problems in\ndogs.\n\n   The drugs may save animals' lives, veterinarians say, by\neliminating or reducing behaviors that would otherwise drive some\nowners to have the animals put to death. About 7 million dogs a\nyear are destroyed because owners can no longer stand their\nbehavior, said Nicholas Dodman, a veterinarian who is a specialist\nin animal behavior at Tufts University, and author of the book\n``The Dog Who Loved Too Much.'' (Bantam, 1997)\n\n   One drug, Clomicalm, will be prescribed for dogs suffering from\nseparation anxiety, which causes them to act out when they are left\nalone, by barking, chewing their owners' belongings, drooling\ncopiously, or defecating or urinating inside the house. Clomicalm\nis manufactured by Novartis Animal Health U.S. Inc., of Greensboro,\nN.C.\n\n   The other drug, Anipryl, will be recommended for ``senior dogs''\nsuffering from canine cognitive dysfunction or ``old dog\nsyndrome,'' a mental deterioration that comes on with age. Such\ndogs often seem to forget that they were housebroken, and may fail\nto recognize their owners. Pfizer, Inc., of Exton, Pa., makes\nAnipryl.\n\n   ``There is a tremendous human-animal bonding relationship\nestablished, especially with senior dogs,'' said Edward Kanara, a\nveterinarian at Pfizer. The relationship breaks down when the dog\nforgets who its owner is, Kanara said, but Anipryl can restore the\nbond.\n\n   Both drugs are reformulated versions of medications that have\nbeen used for years to treat depression or nervous system disorders\nin people. Clomicalm is the name given to clomipramine, an\nanti-depressant. Anipryl is the name given to the drug known as\nselegiline or deprenyl. The drug, which does not improve cognition\nin people, has been used as a treatment for Parkinson's disease.\n\n   Veterinarians, like medical doctors, may legally prescribe any\napproved drug for any purpose and many have already been\nprescribing the human versions of those drugs and others for\nanimals, adjusting the doses for big or small dogs and instructing\npet owners to cut up the pills when necessary.\n\n   The new products contain the same drugs, but the doses and\nlabeling are meant for dogs, and Clomicalm tablets contain meat\nproducts, though FDA officials said the pills were not meat\nflavored.\n\n   By law, the agency approves all veterinary medicines except\nvaccines, which are approved through the Department of Agriculture.\nThere are about 1,500 approved veterinary medicines on the market.\n\n   ``If you've got an old dog that's about to be put down because\nit's been tinkling on the floor, you have another option,'' Dodman\nsaid, referring to Anipryl. ``You can buy that dog some time, buy\nit an extra year where you would have been at your wits' end in a\nsort of latrine situation.''\n\n   Dodman said Prozac is often the best treatment for dogs with\nbehavior problems, including separation anxiety, and fear of crowds\nor thunderstorms. He prescribes Prozac when owners can afford it.\nHe would like to see a canine version of Prozac marketed,\nparticularly to treat aggression, which accounts for 50 percent to\n60 percent of behavior problems in dogs. But he said that drug\ncompanies were afraid to pursue drugs to treat aggression in dogs,\nfor fear that they would be sued if a dog on a drug bit someone\nanyway.\n","Headline":"\nHUMAN DRUGS APPROVED FOR MENTAL PROBLEMS IN DOGS\n","Text":["\n   The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it\nhad approved two drugs already used in people as the first\ntreatments ever marketed specifically to treat mental problems in\ndogs.\n","\n   The drugs may save animals' lives, veterinarians say, by\neliminating or reducing behaviors that would otherwise drive some\nowners to have the animals put to death.
