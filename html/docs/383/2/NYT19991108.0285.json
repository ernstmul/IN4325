BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s touched off intense concern\nand a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken\nduring pregnancy. Many drugs (and druglike substances, including\ncoffee, alcohol and tobacco) were tested in laboratory animals or\nstudied in pregnant women. Some were found to be potential hazards\nto developing fetuses, usually only at the beginning of pregnancy\nbut in some cases only near the time of birth and in others\nthroughout gestation.\n\n   Now most pregnant women are cautioned to avoid any and all\nmedications that are not absolutely essential, as well as\n``pleasure drugs'' like alcohol and tobacco and sometimes coffee\nand caffeine. But while this is sound advice in general, it can\noften result in needless discomfort for women who avoid taking a\nharmless drug that could help them. It also causes undue anxiety\namong those women who must take medication or who inadvertently\ntook one or more drugs before they knew they were pregnant.\n\n   In December 1968, for example, I got the Hong Kong flu the day I\nwas expecting the start of menses. Frequent doses of aspirin kept\nme from burning up, but 10 days later I remained seriously ill and\nstill had not gotten my period. Now I was coughing so hard I\ncracked a rib. This time the diagnosis was double pneumonia, for\nwhich antibiotics and codeine cough medicine were prescribed. Two\nweeks later, my gynecologist informed me that I was pregnant. When\nI asked the doctor about the harm that might have been done by the\ndrugs I had taken, he replied reassuringly, ``If you had not taken\nthem and had died of pneumonia, you would not be having any baby.''\n\n   Still, I spent the next eight months fretting about the harm\nthat might have resulted to my unborn child. But by what seemed at\nthe time to be a miracle, 36 weeks after contracting the flu I gave\nbirth to perfectly healthy, full-term identical twin boys.\n\n   I have since learned that it is reasonably safe for pregnant\nwomen to take a number of drugs in common use, though they should\nconsult their doctors before taking any drug. Even some vaccines,\nincluding the flu vaccine, are safe to administer to pregnant\nwomen. Furthermore, most medications pose no hazard to a nursing\ninfant because the amount that gets into breast milk is usually too\nsmall to have a noticeable effect on the baby.\n\n   Let's start with a general recommendation from Dr. Jennifer R.\nNiebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa\nCollege of Medicine, who says, ``Pregnant women should be\ndiscouraged from using over-the-counter drugs for trivial\nindications.'' Thus, a common cold is best treated with rest,\nfluids, a humidifier and, if needed, a saltwater (saline) nasal\nspray like Ocean. Topical medications, like a decongestant nasal\nspray, are safer than oral ones, and if any cold remedy is used,\ncombination drugs are best avoided. Cough remedies containing\niodide should be avoided because they may cause a large goiter in\nan unborn child.\n\n   For aches and pains, try local applications of heat and rest.\nBut if, say, you have a headache you can't shake and it's\ninterfering with your life, acetaminophen (like Tylenol) is safer\nthan aspirin near the end of pregnancy because it does not prolong\nbleeding and is not toxic to newborns.\n\n   To reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections, a common problem\namong pregnant women, antibiotics should be used only when needed\nto control a known bacterial infection. Safe antibiotics include\npenicillin and its derivatives, erythromycin and the\ncephalosporins. On the other hand, sulfonamides are best avoided in\nthe third trimester, and tetracyclines, which cause discoloration\nof babies' teeth, should not be used beyond 25 weeks of gestation.\n\n   The drug metronidazole, commonly used to treat intestinal\nparasites, is best avoided in the first trimester. Lindane (as in\nKwell), formerly widely used to treat lice infestations, should be\navoided entirely during pregnancy, and pregnant women should wear\nrubber gloves when treating children for head lice; safer\nalternatives are the pyrethroids with piperonyl butoxide (Rid and\nR&C, for example) or a fine-toothed comb.\n\n   The new nonsedating antihistamines used to treat allergies have\nnot been tested for safety in pregnancy. But women who have been\nreceiving desensitization shots can continue to do so at a\nmaintenance dose during pregnancy. Women with asthma can safely use\ntheophylline, aminophylline, terbutaline and cromolyn sodium. And\nit may surprise you to learn that the potent immune-suppressing\ndrugs prednisone and prednisolone are considered drugs of choice\nduring pregnancy because they are nearly completely inactivated by\nthe placenta.\n\n   Also safe are alphamethyldopa and propranolol to treat chronic\nhypertension. For women plagued by heartburn, antacids are safe for\nuse in any trimester, but bicarbonate of soda, magnesium\ntrisilicate and the new H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are\npotentially toxic to the fetus.\n\n   Reports on the safety of the new antidepressants called\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI.'s) have been mixed.\nOne large study of Prozac found no increase in miscarriage or major\nbirth defects, but infants exposed in the womb were more likely to\nhave minor defects. The latest report, based on 524 pregnancies,\nhalf of which involved the use of an SSRI, found no increase in\nmajor malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth\nassociated with the either the SSRI's or tricyclic antidepressant\ndrugs taken in recommended doses during pregnancy.\n\n   Although most medications taken in normal doses by a nursing\nmother are safe for infants, a few are definitely too toxic for a\nbaby. These include chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer; lithium to\ntreat bipolar disorder and drugs like cyclosporine that suppress\nthe immune system. Even when taking a safe drug, a nursing mother\nwould be wise to coordinate the dosages with the baby's schedule,\njust after the baby has been fed or before the baby's longest\nsleep.\n\n   For more information about the safety of over-the-counter drugs\nduring pregnancy, see ``I'm Pregnant and I Have a Cold'' by Dr.\nCraig V. Towers, a perinatologist in California at Long Beach\nMemorial Medical Center, just published by RBC Press ($27.95 in\nhardcover, $14.95 in paperback). Other Substances of Concern\n\n   Barbara K. Hackley, a nurse midwife at the Yale School of\nNursing, recently reviewed the safety of immunizations during\npregnancy in The Journal of Nurse-Midwifery. She approves of the\ntoxoid and inactivated vaccines _ tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B,\ninfluenza and pneumococcal vaccines _ although she advises that\neven these vaccines are best given in the second and third\ntrimesters in case they may have some effect yet unrecognized on a\nyoung fetus. Flu vaccine (taken each fall to include the latest\nstrains) is now recommended for all pregnant women. To be avoided\nare live virus and bacterial vaccines, including those for measles,\nmumps, rubella and chicken pox.\n\n   Legal recreational drugs like alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are\nalso common concerns among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking during\npregnancy can compromise fetal growth, resulting in babies that are\nsmaller than they should be at birth, and may also cause\nlong-lasting intellectual deficits.

In 1980,\nafter reports of birth defects in mice induced by caffeine, the FDA\nwarned pregnant women to limit their intake of coffee. But\nconsiderable evidence accumulated since has not implicated coffee\nas a cause of birth defects in humans. Still, there is some\nevidence that consuming more than three cups of coffee a day may\nslightly reduce birth weights.\n\n     NEXT: Exercising safely during pregnancy.  \n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: DRUGS, SAFE AND NOT SO SAFE, IN PREGNANCY \n","Text":["\n   The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s touched off intense concern\nand a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken\nduring pregnancy.
