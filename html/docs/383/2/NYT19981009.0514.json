Times News Service   \n\n   It began one morning 12 years ago, when Matthew, then 24, could\nbarely crawl out of bed. He persevered at podiatry school in\nChicago for six months while becoming increasingly nervous and\nagitated. Finally, he saw a psychiatrist. The diagnosis was chronic\ndepression, and the doctor wrote a prescription for an\nantidepressant.\n\n   Such medications _ Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil are the most widely\nused _ have truly been wonder drugs, becoming as much a staple of\ndaily life as Big Macs or Tylenol as they have helped lift the\ngloom from the lives of many of the nearly 18 million Americans who\nthe National Institute of Mental Health says are affected each year\nby depression.\n\n   But they do not work for everyone. Matthew, who spoke on the\ncondition that his last name not be used, is one of about 3.6\nmillion depressed people who doctors say get no help from existing\nmedications.\n\n   After spending $15,000 of his own money on doctor fees and\nmedication to learn only that lithium is white, Depakote orange and\nProzac yellow and pale green, Matthew, now a medical technician in\nOcean Township, N.J., wonders if he will ever find a cure.\n\n   ``I'm not that optimistic that a company can develop a drug that\ncan help me,'' he said, ``but I'm willing to wait and see.''\n\n   He may not have to wait long. Sometime in the next five years _\nperhaps as soon as 2001 _ Eli Lilly & Co.'s patents on Prozac will\nexpire, and Lilly and a half-dozen other giant pharmaceutical\ncompanies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in the hope\nof developing the drug that supplants Prozac as the market leader.\n\n   Sales of antidepressants, meanwhile, are expected to reach $8\nbillion in the United States at about the time Lilly loses its\nexclusive rights to Prozac. So, ``there clearly is a lot at stake\nhere,'' said Bruce L. Downey, the chief executive of Barr\nLaboratories, a drug maker involved in a legal fight with Lilly\nover the right to produce a generic version of Prozac.\n\n   Speaking of Barr's fight with Lilly _ but in a comment that\ncould refer to the whole, bruising race _ he added, ``I can\nguarantee you that in this battle, no stone will be left\nunthrown.''\n\n   Still, it is not guaranteed that the Next Big Thing in\nantidepressants will be a boon for the industry _ or even much help\nfor people like Matthew. Many industry analysts say they expect\nthat any new brand-name best seller will be a drug that is no more\neffective than Prozac, but simply has fewer side effects. Moreover,\nthe introduction of generic Prozac may lead cost-cutting managed\nhealth care companies to require doctors to prescribe it rather\nthan the more expensive antidepressants under development.\n\n   Either of those scenarios would fall short of the hopes of many\ndoctors. To satisfy them, the ultimate antidepressant would work\nimmediately in every patient, have no side effects and allow\npatients to follow simple dosage regimens. It could also be given\nto manic-depressives without causing a manic episode.\n\n   ``People are used to taking Tylenol and feeling better shortly\nthereafter, not weeks later,'' said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director\nof the National Institute of Mental Health. ``If someone is\nsuicidal, you may not have weeks.''\n\n   It is unclear which, if any, of the drugs under development will\nbe Hyman's aspirin for depression. Some drug makers are taking\nentirely new approaches to combating depression; the entries from\nNovartis, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer are so young they have yet to\nbe named.\n\n   In any event, drugs from giant companies are akin to children of\nblue-blood families: they tend to succeed even when they are\nmediocre.\n\n   The market is certainly enormous; this year, sales of\nantidepressants in the United States are expected to hit $6.3\nbillion, according to IMS Health, a health care consulting firm.\nDepression costs American businesses $23 billion a year in lost\nwork time and productivity, according to the National Foundation\nfor Depressive Illness, making it one of the nation's most\nexpensive ailments.\n\n   It is also one of the most painful. People who cannot be helped\nby medication are often forced to live with insomnia, fatigue and a\npervasive feeling of despair.\n\n   Lilly's corporate headquarters in Indianapolis is on the front\nlines of the antidepressant battle. Walk into just about any\nmeeting room there, and one is likely to find executives scratching\ntheir heads over how to survive ``Year X'' _ when Prozac loses its\npatent protections.\n\n   Exactly when that will happen is unclear, because the separate\npatents on the drug's chemical makeup and how it works with a\nchemical in the brain expire three years apart, beginning in 2001.\nBarr Laboratories has applied to the Food and Drug Administration\nto make a generic Prozac, and Lilly has sued, contending patent\ninfringement.\n\n   Such legal battles can last for years _ particularly when a\nproduct as valuable as Prozac is at stake. Seldom has one brand\nbeen so central to a company's success. This year, Prozac will\ncontribute nearly 30 percent of Lilly's estimated $10 billion in\nworldwide sales, making it one of the best-selling drugs ever.\n\n   To replace the revenue that will be lost once Prozac's patents\nexpire, Lilly plans to introduce several new drugs, including two\nantidepressants and a compound that would relieve the complications\nof diabetes.\n\n   ``We have plenty of strategies in place to prosper in Year X,''\nsaid Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive. ``The worst scenario\nthat I'm expecting is for earnings gains to fall into the single\ndigits during Year X and then climb back to double digits the year\nafter.''\n\n   If the company falls short, however, investors may want a word\nwith Taurel. Many analysts contend that the race to supplant Prozac\nshould never have begun. Instead, they say, LIlly should have\nmaintained its stranglehold by developing a replacement for Prozac\nsooner.\n\n   ``Several pharmaceutical companies have had a problem replacing\nthe drug that made them famous,'' said Neil Sweig, a\npharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners, a\nresearch firm. ``It's a hard thing to do. One thing in Lilly's\nfavor, though, is that none of the antidepressants that have come\nout recently are better than Prozac. This is a fight that is just\nbeginning.''\n\n   For Lilly shareholders, the big question is how soon Year X will\narrive. Sweig forecasts that Lilly earnings will rise to $2.958\nbillion in 2000, up nearly 70 percent, excluding extraordinary\ncharges, from last year's levels. If Prozac has no generic\ncompetition in 2001, he says, Lilly's earnings will increase 16\npercent in 2001 and 15 percent more in 2002.\n\n   nn\n","Headline":"\nLUSTNG AFTER PROZAC  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) \n","Text":["\n   It began one morning 12 years ago, when Matthew, then 24, could\nbarely crawl out of bed.
