Only 10 to 15 percent of patients remain\nin remission, six months after treatment is stopped.\n\n   But two studies published in the current New England Journal of\nMedicine offer new hope. One, led by researchers at the Scripps\nClinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six\nmonths after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug\ncalled ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients\nbeing treated for the first time. That's 3 to 5 times the response\nrate for people getting interferon alone.\n\n   The other study, led by researchers at the University of Florida\nCollege of Medicine in Gainesville, found that six months after\ntreatment, the same combination was 49 percent effective in\npatients who had relapsed after previous treatment. This is 10\ntimes higher than treatment with interferon alone.\n\n   Together, the studies represent an ``important advance,'' says\nDr. T. Jake Liang, chief of the liver diseases section at the\nNational Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases,\npart of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n   It is still not clear how long treatment should last. In the\nCalifornia study, there was little difference in outcome whether\npeople were treated for six months or 12.

The study is in this\nmonth's American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\n   In a separate study published in the current Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association, Brown University researchers showed\nthat Zoloft, already used for acute depression, is also effective\nas an ongoing treatment for chronic depression.\n\n     \n   \n   Major lung surgery is small operation\n\n        \n  \n\n   Minimally invasive surgery _ in which doctors operate through\none or more small incisions, often aided by tiny TV cameras in\nfiber optic cables _ is clearly an idea whose time has come.\n\n   But is it really possible to remove an entire, intact lung this\nway and send the patient home the same day?\n\n   Yes, says Dr. Eduardo R. Tovar, a thoracic surgeon at St. Jude\nMedical Center in Fullerton, Calif., who describes his technique in\nthis month's issue of Chest, a journal of the American College of\nChest Physicians.\n\n   Traditionally, surgeons have used one long incision _ from the\nshoulder blade, under the arm, around to the front _ to remove a\ncancerous lung. In the last five years, they've also used minimally\ninvasive surgery, which involves four or five small incisions\nbetween the ribs for viewing plus a 4-inch incision under the arm\nthrough which the lung is removed.\n\n   Now, Tovaro says he can remove a lung using only one small _\n3-inch _ incision on the patient's side.\n\n   In the five patients reported on _ he has also done four others\n_ Tovar occasionally uses a miniature TV camera inserted through\nthe same incision to see ligaments that he needs to cut.
