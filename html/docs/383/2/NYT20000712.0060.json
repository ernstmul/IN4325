It's the same antidepressant drug, but now Lilly is\nencouraging doctors to prescribe it for Pre-Menstrual Dysphoria\nDisorder (PMDD) a relatively new condition deemed to be an extreme\nform of pre-menstrual syndrome.\n\n   Forget for a moment that some doctors question whether PMDD\nactually exists. Forget for a moment that an English academic has\nclaimed that the poet Sylvia Plath killed herself because of PMDD,\nwhich is probably bosh. That's not the point; the point is that\nLilly has achieved a cherished ``brand extension,'' and will\nsucceed in selling more pills.\n\n   Prozac occupies the intersection of two primal, American\ncompulsions: the need to sell, and the lure of the quick fix.\nThat's what makes it so fascinating. Capitalizing on clever\nmarketing, brutal infighting, and tens of thousands of genuine\nsuccess stories, Lilly has made Prozac the symbol of Americans'\ninnocent desire to feel better. Twenty-eight million Americans,\nmany of whom are wary of psychiatry and would think twice before\ntaking a pill stronger than Extra-Strength Tylenol, have been\nwilling to give Prozac a try.\n\n   Now Prozac is under siege. After a euphoric high in the early\n1990s, patients and researchers are stepping forward to take their\nwhacks at Prozac and its sister drugs Zoloft, Paxil, etc. Authors\nLauren Slater, Peter Breggin, and most recently Joseph Glenmullen\nof the Harvard Medical School have all described the unpleasant\nunderside of the little green-and-cream-colored wonder pills:\nProzac loses effectiveness over time; the drug creates painful\nwithdrawal symptoms; it induces sexual dysfunction, and _ the most\ndramatic charge of all _ it may exacerbate depressed patients'\nsuicidal tendencies.\n\n   Lilly, which sells over $2 billion worth of Prozac every year,\ndoesn't take criticism lightly. One of the most hair-raising\nstories in American jurisprudence, retold in Glenmullen's new book\n``Prozac Backlash,'' was Lilly's outrageous behavior in the\nso-called Wesbacker trial. Several years ago, a group of plaintiffs\nsought to prove that Prozac prompted a (depressed and suicidal)\npressman named Joseph Wesbacker to kill eight people and himself in\na ``postal'' rampage with an AK-47 in Kentucky. Similar lawsuits\nwere pending, and Lilly could afford neither a negative verdict,\nnor the stigma of a public settlement. So they secretly offered the\nplaintiffs what one lawyer called a ``mind-boggling'' sum, in\nreturn for arguing a weaker case. Lilly got its not-guilty verdict,\nbut when its machinations came to light, a Kentucky appellate judge\nopined that ``the system has been tampered with,'' perhaps the\nunderstatement of the century.\n\n   But let's be realistic. Glenmullen is selling something, too. He\nhasn't researched the effects of Prozac, he's merely assembled some\nof his own case studies and critiqued the work of others. (Breggin,\nthe author of ``Talking Back to Prozac'' has accused Glenmullen of\nripping him off.) Not only is Glenmullen successfully pushing this\nbook, he's simultaneously hawking a collection of his own patients'\nsexual fantasies, called ``Sexual Mysteries,'' on his Web site. One\nof the case studies concerns ``a patient's powerful sexual feelings\nfor her therapist.'' Gives pause, don't you think?\n\n   The irony is that the current spate of bad publicity for Prozac\ncoincides with Lilly's multimillion-dollar reformulation and\nre-launch of the product. The old Prozac/Sarafem patent is\nexpiring, so much of the damage inflicted on the brand will be\nvisited upon rival drug companies hawking a cheaper, generic\nProzac. Meanwhile Lilly will be busy promoting the as-yet-unnamed\n``new, improved'' Prozac.\n\n   Lilly rarely acknowledges the alleged shortcomings of Prozac,\nexcept to say _ correctly, I think _ that critics have exaggerated\nthe drug's known side effects. Yet, as it happens, Lilly's patent\nfiling for Prozac II says the new drug will reduce such side\neffects as nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, and ``suicidal\nthoughts.'' Just a coincidence?
