Times News Service    \n\n   DENVER _ As a debate over the growing use of behavioral drugs\nfor children intensifies across the country, the Colorado Board of\nEducation has passed a resolution meant to discourage teachers from\nrecommending prescription drugs like Ritalin and Luvox for\nstudents.\n\n   The resolution carries no legal weight. But as the first of its\nkind in the nation, it urges teachers and other school personnel to\nuse discipline and instruction to overcome problem behavior in the\nclassroom, rather than to encourage parents to put their children\non drugs that are commonly prescribed for attention deficit and\nhyperactive disorders.\n\n   Proponents of the resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote Nov.\n11, said they were motivated, in part, by evidence that they said\nsuggests dozens of violent crimes in recent years, including the\nmassacre last spring at Columbine High School, were committed by\nyoung people taking psychotropic drugs.\n\n   One of the teen-age shooters at Columbine, Eric Harris, had been\ntaking Luvox, an anti-depressant, although there is no evidence\nthat the drug had anything to do with the shootings.\n\n   No other states are considering a measure similar to the one in\nColorado, where an unusual set of circumstances played a role in\nthe resolution's passage: an elected and fairly conservative school\nboard responding, in part, to the outcry from one of the nation's\nworst school shootings. But the resolution reflects broader issues,\nas well, as parents, mental health professionals and school\nofficials around the country debate the rising use of behavioral\ndrugs for children.\n\n   Experts in children's mental health issues point out that\nchildren who take the drugs do so because they were having\ndifficulties to begin with. They acknowledge that impulsive or\nviolent behavior is a recognized side effect in a small percentage\nof people taking the drugs.\n\n   But in arguing that an overwhelming majority of children who use\nthe drugs are benefiting, they contend that the Colorado resolution\nis irresponsible and perhaps even dangerous in that it could lead\nschool personnel to ignore signs of serious mental disorders in\nchildren and that it would discourage communication between\nteachers and parents.\n\n   ``I hope what happened in Colorado is the exception and not the\nrule,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental\nHealth Association, conceding that he fears other states and school\ndistricts might replicate Colorado's efforts.\n\n   ``Holding up psychotropic medicines as the possible cause of\nviolent behavior is absurd. There's a wealth of information to show\nthat they have helped dramatically.''\n\n   The use of Ritalin and other psychotropic drugs has steadily\nincreased over the years among school-age children to a current\nlevel of about 2.5 million, according to Children and Adults with\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a national nonprofit\norganization known as CHADD, which is based in Landover, Md.\n\n   Here in Colorado, increased usage has turned a new focus onto\nthe role that teachers and administrators play in the daily lives\nof children who attend their schools. It has also pitted experts\nwho say use is growing because the drugs are beneficial against\nthose who contend that parents and teachers are too quick to seek\nout prescription medicine as the simplest way to treat children\nwith behavioral problems.\n\n   Patti Johnson, the Colorado school board member who organized a\nhearing on the issue and proposed the resolution, said that in the\nfive years she has served on the board, she has received ``numerous\ncomplaints'' from parents who claimed a teacher had insisted that\ntheir child go on Ritalin or another drug before returning to\nclass.\n\n   Recounting the case of one girl, who was showing signs of\nattention deficit disorder through mood sweeps and napping in\nclass, Ms. Johnson said the girl was later diagnosed to be\nsuffering from hypoglycemia and just needed to change her diet.\nAccording to the girl's parents, Ms. Johnson said, the teacher told\nthem, ``You need to get her a prescription for Ritalin.''\n\n   As a result, she said, a resolution was designed to remove\nschool personnel from any medical decisions. She said the board,\nwhich consists of six Republicans and one Democrat, passed the\nresolution along party lines with minimal debate. The lone\nDemocrat, Gully Stanford, did not return a telephone call. No other\nversions of of the resolution were considered.\n\n   ``The resolution does not stop teachers from communicating with\nparents,'' Ms. Johnson said in an interview. ``What it does do is\nstop teachers from giving parents an ultimatum: `Put your kid on a\ndrug or we're not going to teach them.' That can't happen any more.\nIt's wrong.''\n\n   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association\nof State Boards of Education, said that Colorado's is one of only\nseven elected state boards of education in the country and those\nboards tend to be more ideological.\n\n   She added, however, ``I agree that too often the first answer\nfor children with some behavior problem is to reach for medication.\nSome of the numbers we are seeing for medication of children are\nstaggering.''\n\n   Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards\nAssociation, said she knew of no other school board examining the\nquestion. She added that while many are concerned about\novermedication, ``We would be reluctant to support such a\nresolution because there are children who may need such services,\nwho may benefit from the medication.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Dr. Stephen Stahl, a professor of psychiatry at the University\nof California in San Diego, said that because of the complexities\nof mental disorders and the rapidly changing personalities of\nchildren as they grow older, both sides of the psychotropic debate\nmay be right. And wrong.\n\n   ``There's no blood test for this,'' he said. ``It's not\nobjective. If a kid is acting out in class and a stimulant like\nRitalin calms him down, it would be immoral not to give him the\nmedicine.\n\n   ``But the problem comes,'' he added, ``when the stimulants don't\nwork and parents give them anyway as an excuse to avoid tough\ndecisions or talking with teachers and doctors to learn what's\ngoing on.''\n\n   Another problem complicating the issue, Stahl said, is the\nlocation of the school. Typically, he said, in poor areas, mental\ndisorders are underdiagnosed, and often in more affluent school\ndistricts, children are overdiagnosed, sometimes making a bad\nsituation worse.\n\n   Besides complaints from parents about insistent teachers, Ms.\nJohnson said she was also motivated to propose the resolution by\nthe violent crimes involving young people, in which investigators\nsaid the perpetrators were using psychotropic drugs. Accounts of\nthose incidents also persuaded a Colorado state lawmaker, Penn\nPfiffner of Lakeland, to hold a separate hearing on the issue,\nwhich, by coincidence, came two days before the school board voted\non Ms. Johnson's measure.\n\n   Dr. Peter Breggin, director of the International Center for the\nStudy of Psychiatry and Psychology, a nonprofit research\norganization in Bethesda, Md., testified at both hearings and said\ndoctors have become too eager to prescribe psychotropic drugs at\nthe expense of conversations among parents, teachers and children\nto learn why children are acting in anti-social ways.\n\n   ``It's a tremendous mistake to subdue the behavior of children\ninstead of tending to their needs,'' Breggin said in an interview.\n\n   ``We're drugging them into submission rather than identifying\nand meeting the genuine needs of the family, the school and the\ncommunity. It's wrong in principle.''\n\n   Citing Harris and other young killers who were found to be\ntaking Ritalin and other drugs, Breggin said he is convinced that\nthere is a direct link between the drugs and violent acts. He also\nasserted that the drug harms children.\n\n   Cohen of CHADD and others said the resolution might inhibit\nteachers from applying their own common sense and experience in the\ncase of a troublesome child by merely telling parents that\nsomething is wrong without offering a full range of possible\nsolutions.\n\n   ``If a child has hearing or vision problems that the teacher\nidentifies, we would expect the teacher to talk to the parents,''\nsaid Jeanne Mueller Rohner, executive director of the Mental Health\nAssociation of Colorado, which opposed the resolution. ``It should\nbe the same thing for mental health.''\n\n   Opponents of the measure also said they were uncomfortable with\nthe ardent support offered the measure by the Church of Scientology\nthrough an affiliate organization, the Citizens Commission on Human\nRights.
