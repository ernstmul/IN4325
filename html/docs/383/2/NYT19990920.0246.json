No factual\nchanges.) \n(''e'' in Marjorie Poche's last name is accented) \n(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) \nBy KATHY SANDERS \nc.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram \n\n   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A doctor had prescribed the anti-depressant\ndrug Prozac for Larry Gene Ashbrook, but investigators are unsure\nwhy and whether he was taking it when he killed seven people and\nthen himself in a southwest Fort Worth church last week, police\nsaid on Monday.\n\n   Fort Worth Lt. Mark Krey, who is heading the investigation into\nthe largest mass shooting in the city's history, said police found\na Prozac vial in Ashbrook's name and want to ask doctors why it was\nprescribed.\n\n   Krey said Ashbrook, 47, may have slipped past the brink of\nsanity after his 85-year-old father died in July.\n\n   ``The level of paranoia within his life had advanced to an\nextreme stage,'' Krey said. ``We're investigating the possibility\nthat with the death of his father, Mr. Ashbrook stopped taking\nmedication. We believe when he lost his father, who was his anchor\nto reality and his caretaker to ensure he took his medication, he\nlost any connection to reality.''\n\n   Also on Monday, police said a homemade pipe bomb exploded in\nWedgwood Baptist Church with enough velocity to send a piece of\nshrapnel hurtling 80 feet before slicing through a wall and landing\nin the hallway outside the sanctuary.\n\n   But rather than blasting out into a sanctuary where more than\n150 worshippers were taking part in a youth service, most of the\nshrapnel shot toward the ceiling and then rained down. No one was\nseriously injured by the shrapnel.\n\n   ``We are very blessed in the manner in which it detonated ... or\nit would have caused serious bodily injury,'' Krey said.\n\n   Prozac is commonly used to treat various forms of clinical\ndepression, including depression in children, as well as bulimia\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n   Dr. Peter Kowlaski, a psychiatrist in private practice in Fort\nWorth and former medical director for Mental Health and Mental\nRetardation Services of Tarrant County, said the medical community\ngenerally views Prozac as a good antidepressant that does not\ncontribute to, or prevent, violent behavior.\n\n   ``The person who is ill will sometimes act out violently, but\nmost people with psychiatric illnesses are not likely to act\nviolently,'' he said. ``Those who do most often do evil independent\nof their psychiatric conditions.''\n\n   It is unclear where police found the Prozac bottle; it was not\non the list of items that law enforcement officers took from\nAshbrook's suburban Forest Hill home. FBI officials said they did\nfind nine vials of prescription drugs for Jack Ashbrook, who died\nafter a battle with cancer, as well as a diary in which the father\ndocumented his medication, said spokeswoman Marjorie Poche.\n\n   ``The writing changed in the last couple of weeks of the diary.\nIt's only speculation, but he (Larry Ashbrook) may have started\ntaking his father's medication,'' she said. ``Either that or he\nstarted recording when his father took the pills. ...''\n\n   On Wednesday night, Ashbrook interrupted the youth rally at\nWedgwood by firing methodically into a crowd of students, police\nsaid.\n\n   Killed were Kristi Beckel, 14; Shawn Brown, 23; Susan Kimberly\nJones, 23; Cassandra Griffin, 14; Joseph ``Joey'' Ennis, 14; Sydney\nBrowning, 36; and Justin Ray, 17. Seven others were injured.\n\n   The final three victims were laid to rest on Monday, but\nAshbrook's body remained unclaimed at the Tarrant County Medical\nExaminer's Office.\n\n   Aaron Ashbrook, his brother, said the family is completing\nfuneral arrangements, but declined to comment further.\n\n   ``I think there probably has been more said than there needs to\nbe, and a lot of it's untrue,'' he said.\n\n   He declined to elaborate.\n\n   ``It wouldn't make any difference,'' he said. ``I think the\ndamage has already been done.''\n\n   Investigators sorted information on Monday from nearly 70\ndepositions taken from people the night of the shooting,\nreinterviewed the wounded and tried to trace Ashbrook's final,\nfatal steps.\n\n   ``Investigators are going though a number of depositions to\ndetermine the exact sequence of events,'' said homicide Sgt. Dave\nLoftis. ``We want to know, first of all, specifically what happened\nand how everything went down that day.''\n\n   But the answer to the most-asked questions _ what set Ashbrook\noff and why did he choose Wedgwood _ may never come.\n\n   ``I don't have any motive right now,'' Loftis said. ``I don't\nknow if we'll ever have an answer to those questions. If we can, we\ncertainly will get them. It's like any of those senseless acts of\nviolence, there aren't any answers. And can any motive explain it\nand make sense of it?''\n\n   Police also said on Monday that they have found no connection\nbetween Ashbrook and any hate group.\n\n   In his writings, Larry Ashbrook details a vast, unspecified\nconspiracy against him by law enforcement and others. His brother\ndescribed him as a paranoid schizophrenic to sheriff's deputiesin a\nneighboring county. But the state mental health system said last\nweek that it has no record of any contact with Ashbrook.\n\n   Krey said Ashbrook apparently was such a loner that few people\nhave been found to help explain his activities.\n\n   ``I believe we won't find anybody because there is nobody to\nfind. And that is consistent with the mental illness he appeared to\nbe afflicted with,'' he said.\n\n   Inside the church, Ashbrook fired all six rounds from a\n.380-caliber semiautomatic, then fired up to 50 more shots from a\nRuger 9mm semiautomatic pistol, officials said.\n\n   Six of the seven people who died were killed by bullet wounds in\nthe head, autopsy reports show. The seventh was shot in the back.\n\n   Ashbrook shot himself with the 9mm, police said. He apparently\nwas alive in a back pew when paramedics rushed into the sanctuary,\nbut was pronounced dead a short time later, police said.\n\n   Ray and a woman separately videotaped Ashbrook's rampage, police\nsaid.\n\n   Officials in Forest Hill said Ashbrook also may have made a\nfutile effort to contaminate the city's water system.\n\n   ``He put concrete in the commodes and, working for the city, I\nwanted to make sure he didn't do something else,'' said Public\nWorks Director Michael Duehring.\n\n   ``I wanted to make sure he did not contaminate our water system.\nI can't go any further than that and tell you what he did, but he\ndidn't do any damage.''\n\n   FBI officials inspected plumbing in Ashbrook's home Thursday but\ndid not consider the threat serious, Poch said.\n\n   ``The agent said it looked like he was just trying to mess up\nthe inside of the house,'' she said. ``The agent who was out there\nsaid he had ripped off the shower head and neck and put one of\nthose paper cones and a quart of motor oil to back down into the\npipes.
