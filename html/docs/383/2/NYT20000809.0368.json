Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court ruling Wednesday cleared the\nway for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's\ntop-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two\nyears earlier than expected.\n\n   Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, said it would appeal the ruling,\nbut the company's stock plunged 29 percent Wednesday to $76.875 as\ninvestors digested the news. Lilly sold $2.6 billion of Prozac last\nyear, and the drug now makes up about 26 percent of Lilly's\nrevenue.\n\n   The ruling was good news for the 38 million people around the\nworld who have taken Prozac. The generic version could be priced at\nless than one-third of the current price of the drug. A 30-day\nsupply of Prozac now costs about $90 at a Duane Reade pharmacy in\nNew York.\n\n   The stock price of Barr Laboratories, the drugmaker that will\nsell the first generic version of Prozac, rose Wednesday by 66\npercent to $76.\n\n   Bruce L. Downey, Barr's chairman and chief executive, predicted\nthat the ruling would cause more generic drug companies to bring\ncourt challenges to the numerous patents that brand name drugmakers\nfile to try to keep cheaper, generic versions of their drugs off\nthe market.\n\n   Efforts to extend the monopoly on a popular brand-name drug are\ncommon in the pharmaceutical industry and critical to companies'\nprofitability. A patent gives a drug company the right to be the\nsole seller of a given drug for 20 years from the date the patent\napplication is filed. But often the companies file numerous patent\napplications on different aspects of the same drug _ different uses\nof the drug, for example, or slightly different formulations _ to\ntry to get even more years of exclusive sales.\n\n   ``We felt strongly that what they had a patent on was not\npatentable,'' Downey said. ``We kept the faith because we felt so\nstrongly about it.''\n\n   Barr first filed its patent challenge in April 1996. The company\nargued, in part, that Lilly held two patents on the same drug. Barr\ncontended that one of Lilly's patents on Prozac, which expires in\n2003, was a ``double patent'' and was not valid.\n\n   In a pre-trial hearing in January 1999, Judge Sarah Barker of\nthe U.S. District Court in Indianapolis dismissed that claim. But\nbefore the trial started, both Barr and Lilly agreed to take the\ncase directly to the appeals court in Washington.\n\n   Wednesday, the appeals court reversed Barker's decision. But the\ncourt upheld a second decision by Barker that Lilly's patent\nexpiring in August 2001 was valid. As a result, Barr can sell\ngeneric Prozac as early as next August.\n\n   In a conference call Wednesday, Lilly executives said that they\nexpect sales of Prozac to fall quickly in the second half of next\nyear as people begin to buy the generic version.\n\n   ``This is not the outcome we had hoped for,'' said Sidney\nTaurel, chairman and chief executive of Eli Lilly.\n\n   Taurel said that the company would appeal the decision, either\nto the federal Appeals Court that ruled Wednesday or to the Supreme\nCourt. But he said that the company also had ``a contingency plan''\nin place in case the appeal failed. That plan includes getting\nregulatory approval for two different versions of Prozac, both of\nwhich are patented: a once-a-week Prozac and a new version of\nProzac, which is now being developed by Sepracor, a drug company\nbased in Marlborough, Mass.\n\n   Lilly also plans to begin selling Sarafem this month. Sarafem is\nthe same drug as Prozac, but it will be marketed to women as a\ntreatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or severe\npremenstrual symptoms.\n\n   Taurel also said that other other new drugs now in development _\nincluding Zovant, a drug to treat blood infections, and Forteo, a a\ntreatment for osteoporosis _ will help offset any reduction in\nsales of Prozac. By late 2002, Lilly executives expect revenue to\nbegin increasing again by 10 percent or more.\n\n   In late June, Lilly's stock priced soared when research showed\nthat Zovant was found to reduce deaths from septic infections.\n\n   Based on its stock price compared to its earnings, Lilly was the\nmost expensive stock in the industry before Wednesday's ruling.\n\n   ``This was completely unexpected,'' said Sergio Traversa, an\nanalyst who covers drug stocks for ING Barings. He said that\ninvestors had been bidding up Lilly's stock because of the strong\nproducts in its development pipeline. Traversa said analysts had\nexpected that Lilly would have time to get r-fluoxetine, the\nversion of Prozac being developed by Sepracor, on the market before\nits Prozac patent expired.\n\n   ``Lilly will appeal,'' Traversa said, ``but they do not appear\nto be confident that they will be able to reverse the decision.''\n\n   The court's ruling also caused the share prices of the makers of\nother antidepressives to fall. The stock of Forest Laboratories,\nthe maker of Celexa, fell by 24 percent to $89.50. Pfizer, the\nmaker of Zoloft, fell $2.171875 to $42.75.\n\n   Sepracor's share price also plunged, falling $23.375 to\n$106.125.\n\n   Lilly's shares fell $31.671875 to $76.875.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. COURT RULING TO HASTEN INTRODUCTION OF GENERIC FORM OF\nPROZAC \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court ruling Wednesday cleared the\nway for the sale of a generic version of Prozac, the world's\ntop-selling antidepressant, as early as next summer, about two\nyears earlier than expected.\n","\n   Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, said it would appeal the ruling,\nbut the company's stock plunged 29 percent Wednesday to $76.875 as\ninvestors digested the news.
