The Algerian man was charged with taking\nbomb-making materials into Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada. In\naddition, federal prosecutors on Thursday linked Ressam with a\nCanadian woman, Lucia Garofalo, arrested Dec. 19 at a remote\nVermont border crossing and charged with illegally entering the\nUnited States with an Algerian man accused of using a false\npassport.\n\n   The fear of an attack has led law enforcement agencies in the\nnation's capital to set up unprecedented security measures for the\nWhite House's ``Millennium Gala'' on the Mall. The event will\nfeature some of America's most famous artists and actors, as well\nas President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n   ``I don't think we've ever had to deal with this kind of\ncelebration with this many stars and politicians and with such a\nthreat of a possible attack,'' said Sgt. Rob MacLean, U.S. Park\nPolice spokesman.\n\n   As a result, the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the\nWashington Monument looked like a cross between an outdoor rock\nconcert and a minimum-security prison.\n\n   In front of the Lincoln Memorial, construction workers building\nthe stage and bleachers for the show gingerly avoided police dogs\nsniffing for explosives. On the street, groups of flannel-wearing\nwelders stood beside groups of men in dark suits and sunglasses\nwith wires coming out of their ears. And watching all of it from on\ntop of the memorial were several men in black uniforms.\n\n   But many among the hundreds of tourists watching the\ncelebration's preparations seemed pleased by the security measures.\n\n   ``It's sad that they need so many police, but I'm glad they're\nhere,'' said Michelle Farland of Nashville, Tenn., who added that\nshe would be on Mall on Friday night.\n\n   Andreas Lubbecker, who traveled from Darmstadt, Germany, to be\nin the United States for New Year's Eve, said the possibility of a\nterrorist attack would not keep him away from the celebration.\n``You do not fly across the ocean to sit in a hotel room,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   MacLean said Park Police officers already are on round-the-clock\npatrols in the areas where the president and his guests will appear\nduring the New Year's Eve celebration. Police also will shut off\naccess to the Vietnam Veterans and Korean War memorials _ both of\nwhich are located near the Reflecting Pool _ on Friday to allow the\nsniffing dogs to sweep the entire area.\n\n   MacLean also said the streets immediately around the Mall will\nbe closed Friday and that people attending the celebration will\nhave to pass through checkpoints. Officers also will be looking\ninside coolers, backpacks and any other packages that could conceal\na bomb.\n\n   Washington, D.C.'s police and the Park Police have said they\nwill have nearly every officer and agent on duty that evening. The\ncity's force has more than 3,600 officers and the Park Police have\nabout 500 officers in the Washington area. The Secret Service also\nwill be out in force guarding the president, but that agency would\nnot disclose its numbers on duty.\n\n   To aid the security forces, about 300 National Guard soldiers\nwill be working in shifts around the clock from Friday through\nSunday. The troops will be at 150 locations throughout the city,\ndirecting traffic and helping with crowd control.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\n   If all goes well on New Year's Eve, a daylong celebration will\nbegin at 11 a.m. on Friday with performances on the Mall by youth\nchoirs, the U.S. Marine Corps Band and other performers. The\npresident and first lady will unveil the ``National Millennium Time\nCapsule,'' containing artifacts representing America at the end of\nthe 20th century.\n\n   At 7 p.m., the Clintons will host a dinner for 1,000 invited\nguests at the White House. A select 320 _ including Elizabeth\nTaylor, Robert De Niro and Muhammed Ali _ will sit down with the\nfirst couple in the White House. The rest, including many members\nof Congress, will dine in a heated tent in the Rose Garden.\n\n   After dinner, the Clintons and 500 guests will go to the Lincoln\nMemorial for a three-hour ``America's Millennium Gala,'' which will\nbe televised live on CBS with actor-rapper Will Smith as the host.\n\n   The gala will include entertainment by Robert Duvall, Diane\nKeaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes\nMitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Trisha Yearwood, Sam\nWaterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell, accompanied by the\n25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''\n\n   In the final half-hour of 1999, large projection screens erected\nbeside the Lincoln Memorial will show an 18-minute film, ``The\nUnfinished Journey'' by Steven Spielberg.\n\n   After that, Clinton will speak briefly and set off the evening's\npyrotechnic extravaganza. He will light a fuse that will burn its\nway along the length of the Reflecting Pool, ending at the base of\nthe Washington Monument, now surrounded by an elaborate scaffold\nbecause of refurbishing work.\n\n   Finally,10 successive bursts of brilliant white stars will rain\ndown the sides of the monument. At midnight, the entire monument\nwill be covered with ``a stunningly beautiful waterfall'' of white\npyrotechnics, said Philip Butler, who is producing the show for\nFireworks by Grucci, a Long Island, N.Y., company.\n\n   Information on the events and performances on the Mall from\nFriday through Sunday Washington is available at\nwww.americasmillennium.gov.\n\n   (Mark Helm can be reached at 202-298-6920 or at the e-mail\naddress mark   hearstdc.com)\n","Headline":"\n      HEIGHTENED SECURITY SEEN AT NATIONAL NEW YEAR'S SITE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ While English crooner Tom Jones practiced his\nclassic song ``It's Not Unusual'' on the National Mall Thursday,\nsecurity officers scanned the two-mile-long site for anything\nremotely unusual.\n","\n   It was all part of White House preparations for a star-studded\nNew Year's Eve celebration amid heightened concern here in the wake\nof the arrest of a suspected terrorist earlier this month on the\nWest Coast.\n","\n   To make the security agents' job easier, the U.S. Park Police\nhas fenced off a stretch of the Mall running from the Washington\nMonument to the Lincoln Memorial, where 200,000 people are expected\nto show up for the millennium extravaganza Friday night.\n","\n   ``I was leaning over the fence by the (memorial's) Reflecting\nPool to see what was going on, and the next thing I know a police\nofficer popped out from the trees and told me to back away,'' said\ntourist Michael Bolt of Cincinnati, Ohio. ``It didn't bother me\nsince I figured it was probably a good thing that people are\nwatching.''\n","\n   While the FBI has said it has received no specific threats\nagainst targets here, law enforcement agencies around the country\nhave been on high alert for a possible act of terror since the Dec.\n14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam.
