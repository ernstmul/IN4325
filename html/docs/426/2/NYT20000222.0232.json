(nk) \n By LINDA GREENHOUSE   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ A decade after upholding the use of roadblocks to\ncatch drunken drivers, the Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide\nwhether adding a drug-sniffing dog to the checkpoint renders the\npractice unconstitutional.\n\n   The justices accepted an appeal from the city of Indianapolis,\nwhere the use of drug-detection roadblocks was declared\nunconstitutional last year by a federal appeals court. Courts\naround the country have differed on the legality of this\nincreasingly popular law-enforcement technique.\n\n   In this case, Judge Richard Posner, writing for the 7th U.S.\nCircuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, said that in contrast to the\nsafety rationale that justified the sobriety checkpoints, the\ndrug-detection roadblocks appeared to be little more than ``a\npretext for a dragnet search for criminals.''\n\n   Posner said the Indianapolis program ``belongs to the genre of\ngeneral programs of surveillance which invade privacy wholesale in\norder to discover evidence of crime,'' amounting to an unreasonable\nsearch under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n   Indianapolis set up the drug roadblocks six times during 1998,\nstopping 1,161 cars and making 55 arrests for transporting\nnarcotics as well as 49 arrests for other misconduct. The program\nwas challenged in a class-action lawsuit brought by the Indiana\nCivil Liberties Union.\n\n   In its Supreme Court appeal, Indianapolis vs. Edmond, No.\n99-1030, the city is arguing that the relatively high number of\narrests demonstrates the program's usefulness as well as dimension\nof the drug problem it was designed to attack.\n\n   The city noted that the Supreme Court had ruled in 1983 that a\n``canine sniff'' by a trained drug-detecting dog involves such a\nminimal intrusion that it is not a search for purposes of the\nFourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable search and seizure.\nConsequently, the city is arguing, adding this element to a lawful\nroadblock could not logically result in a Fourth Amendment\nviolation.\n\n   The Supreme Court ruled in a 1990 case, Michigan vs. Sitz, that\na sobriety checkpoint, while constituting a seizure, was not\nunreasonable because the interest in public safety outweighed the\nminimal intrusion on a driver's time and privacy.\n\n   In his opinion for the appeals court panel, in which he was\njoined by Judge Diane P. Wood, Posner said the Michigan case stood\nfor the principle that the general rule requiring the police to\nhave a specific basis for stopping someone could be relaxed for a\npurpose other than crime detection, such as public safety.\n``Catching crooks'' was not such a purpose, he said.\n\n   Dissenting in the 2-1 decision, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook said\nthat state and local governments should have the flexibility to\nchoose the law enforcement methods they prefer. ``The real threat\nto civil liberties comes from the national government, not from\nlaw-enforcement variations that can be avoided by driving a few\nmiles to the east or west,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nCOURT TO TAKE CASE OF DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS AT ROADBLOCK\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ A decade after upholding the use of roadblocks to\ncatch drunken drivers, the Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide\nwhether adding a drug-sniffing dog to the checkpoint renders the\npractice unconstitutional.\n","\n   The justices accepted an appeal from the city of Indianapolis,\nwhere the use of drug-detection roadblocks was declared\nunconstitutional last year by a federal appeals court.
