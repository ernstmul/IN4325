(nk) \n By BOB HERBERT   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   An anti-loitering law that allowed the Chicago police to arrest\nmore than 42,000 people from 1992 to 1995 was declared\nunconstitutional last week by the Supreme Court.\n\n   Antonin Scalia howled in dissent, which should tell you\nsomething. The law was an abomination, just like the practice in\nNew York of stopping and frisking black and Hispanic people by the\ntens of thousands for no good reason. And just like the practice of\npulling over and harassing perfectly innocent black and Hispanic\nmotorists on streets and highways in many parts of the country.\n\n   Ethnic profiling by law-enforcement authorities in the United\nStates comes in many forms, and all of them are disgusting.\n\n   Last summer sadistic members of the state police in Oklahoma\nspent more than two hours humiliating Rossano Gerald, a 37-year-old\nArmy sergeant, and his 12-year-old son, Greg.\n\n   Gerald was pulled over and interrogated. He was ordered out of\nhis car and handcuffed. The troopers asked if he had any guns. They\nasked permission to search the car and when he refused they\nsearched it anyway. They separated Greg from his father and locked\nhim in a police vehicle. They interrogated him. They brought\ndrug-sniffing dogs to the scene. They dismantled parts of the car.\nWhen they finally tired of the madness, they told Gerald he was\nfree to go. No arrest was made. Greg, of course, was petrified.\nWhen the ordeal ended he wept uncontrollably.\n\n   Why did this happen? Greg and Gerald were guilty of America's\noriginal sin. They were born black.\n\n   In New York, profiling was not only perpetuated but elevated to\nastonishing new heights during the regime of Rudolph Giuliani. Here\nthe targets are mostly pedestrians, not motorists. Young black and\nHispanic males (and in some cases females) are stopped, frisked and\nharassed in breathtaking numbers.\n\n   By the Police Department's own count, more than 45,000 people\nwere stopped and frisked by members of the Street Crimes Unit in\n1997 and 1998. But the total number of arrests made by the unit\nover those two years was less than 10,000. And it is widely\nbelieved that the number of people stopped during that period was\nfar higher than the 45,000 reported by the cops. The true number\nlikely was in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, noted last week that two things characterize the New York\nCity stops: ``Virtually everybody is innocent, and virtually\neverybody is not white.''\n\n   Giuliani, like most public officials, will not acknowledge that\nhis police officers are targeting people by race. ``The stops are\ndriven by the descriptions of the person who committed the crime,''\nGiuliani said last month.\n\n   Spare me. The vast majority of these stops are in no way\nconnected to the commission of a specific crime, and the mayor\nknows it. They are arbitrary and unconscionable intrusions on the\nrights of New Yorkers who are supposed to be protected, not\nhumiliated, by the police.\n\n   Most Americans have no idea of the extent of the race-based\nprofiling that is carried out by law-enforcement officials, and the\ndemoralizing effect it has on its victims. The ACLU, in a report\ncalled ``Driving While Black: Racial Profiling on Our Nation's\nHighways,'' said: ``No person of color is safe from this treatment\nanywhere, regardless of their obedience to the law, their age, the\ntype of car they drive, or their station in life.''\n\n   The Chicago law that resulted in more than 42,000 arrests over\nthree years was aimed at curbing gang activity. It was clearly\nunconstitutional. It made it a crime for anyone in the presence of\nsuspected gang members to ``remain in any one place with no\napparent purpose'' after being told by the police to move on.\n\n   Why should one's purpose for being in a public place have to be\napparent? As a reporter for The New York Times, I might be in the\npresence of a suspected gang member. What business is that of the\npolice? And how could that possibly be a legitimate basis for an\narrest?\n\n   The suit challenging the law was brought by the Chicago office\nof the ACLU. A spokesman for the group noted that the ``vast\nmajority'' of the people arrested under the law were\nAfrican-American or Hispanic.\n\n   What a surprise.\n","Headline":"\nIN AMERICA: HOUNDING THE INNOCENT\n","Text":["\n   An anti-loitering law that allowed the Chicago police to arrest\nmore than 42,000 people from 1992 to 1995 was declared\nunconstitutional last week by the Supreme Court.\n","\n   Antonin Scalia howled in dissent, which should tell you\nsomething.
