How powerful is a dog's sense of smell?\n\n   J.R., Newton, Mass.   \n   \n(poetry style)   \n  \n\n   There once was a dog that could tell\n\n   The difference twixt Heaven and Hell\n\n   It wasn't his heart\n\n   That could tell them apart\n\n   But his powerfully keen sense of smell.\n\n     \n(end poetry style)   \n  \n\n   A. Well, maybe your Schnauzer's schnoz isn't that discerning,\nbut Dr. Larry Myers, of the Veterinary School at Auburn University,\nsays dogs are at the top of the animal kingdom (along with rats)\nwhen it comes to their ability to smell.\n\n   He says in one test, dogs were 1,000 times better at smelling a\ntest odor than humans. In another, dogs could smell one part of\nhydrogen sulfide per quadrillion parts of air. Humans can only pick\nit up at 100 parts per quadrillion.\n\n   Dr. Myers cautions that canine olfactory power varies depending\non the smell, the breed, and the dog. Even the diet of the dog can\naffect how well it can smell. He says all breeds do very well with\nsmell, not just the traditional tracking dogs like bloodhounds.\nShort-haired breeds are generally better.\n\n   Why do dogs smell so well? Their noses are lined with 20 times\nmore olfactory receptor cells than humans have. Dr. Myers says\nthose receptors may be loaded with extra chemicals that make them\nmore ready to fire a ``smell'' message to the brain. The nerves\ncarrying the smell message to the brain may integrate those signals\nmore efficiently. And the dog's olfactory bulbs, the parts of the\nbrain that receive and process the message from the nose, are\nlarger than in most animals, relative to brain size.\n\n   He says dogs smell not only by sniffing, but by licking. Like\nsnakes, they grab molecules with their tongue and carry it to a\nvomeronasal organ in the hard palate in the roof of the mouth,\nwhich detects olfactory stimuli.\n\n   Dogs are trained to sniff for drugs, land mines, toxic waste,\npetroleum distillates used to start a fire, brown tree snakes in\nHawaii, even cows in heat. Cows are in estrus for only about 12\nhours. ``The dairy industry last year lost $300 million in missed\nmating opportunities,'' Dr. Myers says. ``Bulls can only detect\nabout 70 percent of the females ready to mate. Dogs detect between\n90 and 100 percent.''\n\n     \n(Readers are invited to send science questions to How&Why.
