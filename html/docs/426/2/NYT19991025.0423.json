Ron Dykes, commander of the\nDeKalb County Police Department's narcotics squad.\n\n   Traditionally, Southeastern narcotics shipments have moved from\nFlorida through Georgia on I-95, I-85 and I-75, all north-south\ninterstates.\n\n   But a decade of South Florida crackdowns by the Coast Guard, Air\nForce and Customs Service have forced drug barons to seek other\nroutes, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n   Smugglers who once worked mainly by sea and air now are driving\nacross Mexico, catching I-20 at its westernmost point near El Paso,\nTexas. From there, they can head straight into downtown Atlanta to\nconnect with I-75 and its Detroit-Chicago offshoots or I-85 for a\nnortheastern run.\n\n   ``If the pressure's on in one area, then they move somewhere\nelse,'' said David Luitweiler, executive assistant to the director\nof the DEA.\n\n   Even though the detour indicates that the Florida crackdowns\nhave made an impact, it doesn't necessarily signal a reduction in\ndrugs on Americans streets, authorities acknowledge. ``The only\nthing anybody knows about is what's caught,'' said Agent Joe Long\nof the DEA's El Paso intelligence center. No single agency tries to\ncount how many pounds of drugs are confiscated by local police\ndepartments, which account for most arrests, authorities say.\n\n   The DEA does, however, count its drug seizures, and they\ndocument the shift from Florida to the Mexican border states.\n\n   Does the I-20 traffic mean more drugs are being pumped into\nneighborhoods along the route? Not necessarily, police say. Like\nevery big city, Atlanta is a major drug market, but most of the\ndrugs on its bypass highways keep moving up the interstate system.\n\n   Still, the illegal cargo can spell danger for interstate traffic\ncops, officers say. ``If you're dealing with that level of\nviolator, the potential for violence is always increased,'' said\nConyers, Ga. Police Chief Tony Lucas, whose officers patrol I-20\neast of Atlanta.\n\n   That's why Lucas made interdiction a department initiative this\nyear. He bought two K-9 dogs to sniff out suspicious vehicles and\ntrained his traffic officers to watch for possible drug runners.\n\n   This month, a driver was weaving along I-20 through Conyers. A\npatrolling officer was close behind, and his suspicions grew by the\nmoment. Why was there a tattered dealer's tag on a new-looking car?\nAnd why did the driver freeze up, clenching the wheel, when the\npatrol car pulled by his side, even before the siren sounded? After\nhe stopped the car, the officer wondered what was in a black\ngarbage bag on the floorboard. With the police station less than a\nmile away, a drug-sniffing K-9 dog was rushed to the scene while\nthe arresting officer stalled the suspect.\n\n   A few barks and paw scratches were all the police needed for\nprobable cause to search the car. Under the bag was 8 pounds of\nmarijuana.\n\n   It's the harder drugs Lucas would like to intercept, such as\ncocaine and heroin. But another fast-growing concern is\nmethamphetamine, produced in large Mexican labs.\n\n   ``The metro Atlanta area is often known as the methamphetamine\ncapital of the Southeast,'' said John Andrejko, special agent in\ncharge of the DEA's regional office.\n\n   Fueling the I-20 connection is what authorities call a growing\npartnership between Colombian and Mexican drug bosses, who operated\nindependently for the most part until 10 years ago.\n\n   Now, Colombian producers cooperate with Mexican drivers, who\npick up shipments and cross the U.S. border.\n\n   That overland route is an alternative to the old Caribbean and\nAtlantic crossings, where smugglers are watched by Coast Guard\ncrews, AWACS aerial surveillance and Federal Aviation\nAdministration radar. Georgia State Patrol troopers say they have\nseized more drugs on I-20 but have seen no let-up on the\nnorth-south routes. ``At one time we saw a drop, but it's back to\nrunning like before,'' said patrol spokesman Gordy Wright. ``With\nthe volume of traffic now, what law enforcement gets now is just\nthe tip of the iceberg.''\n\n   Last week, Louisiana police found 24 pounds of Valium in a car\nduring a traffic stop in Shreveport, the first city east of the\nTexas line on I-20. ``A few years ago, about the only thing coming\nwest to east was marijuana,'' said Louisiana Trooper Don Campbell.\n``Now it's everything: cocaine, methamphetamines, prescription\ndrugs.''\n\n   West of Atlanta on I-20, Douglas County Sheriff Tommy Waldrop\nagreed: ``You're seeing more drugs everywhere.''\n\n   In Conyers, Chief Lucas has focused on the drug war as a member\nof the narcotics committee of the International Association of\nChiefs of Police.\n\n   ``You can't put an agent at every mile on the border,'' Lucas\nsaid. ``As long as we're the United States of America, and we\nwelcome everybody with open arms, then that makes it an easy route\nto funnel drugs.''\n\n   BOX\n\n   In the past three years, more drugs seized by federal agents\noriginate on the Southwest border (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and\nsouthern California) as opposed to Florida.
