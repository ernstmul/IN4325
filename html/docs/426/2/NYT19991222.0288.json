This is\nnot a reaction to things that happened out west.''\n\n   The Georgia State Patrol and local law enforcement agencies also\nwill beef up staffing shortly after Christmas, but that also was\nplanned as a response to Y2K.\n\n   Bob Finke, a senior security consultant with IPSA International,\nInc. in Atlanta, said Americans should be particularly vigilant\nthis holiday season because of the recent arrest in Washington and\nrepeated threats against the United States by terrorist leader\nOsama bin Laden.\n\n   Americans tend to let down their guard during the holidays and\nmight be more inclined to do so as 1999 becomes 2000, he said.\n\n   ``The unfortunate part about our country is we have a\ntarget-rich environment and we can't protect it all. Terrorists say\nlaw enforcement and security experts have to be lucky all the time.\nTerrorists only have to be lucky once,'' Finke said.\n\n   Celestine Armstead, spokeswoman for the Atlanta office of the\nFBI, would not say if additional agents are being called to duty\nbecause of the increased threat from terrorism or Y2K. ``We're\ngoing to be adequately staffed to address the situation,'' Armstead\nsaid.\n\n   Lt. Col. Ken Baldowski, spokesman for the Georgia National\nGuard, said no special precautions are being made beyond what is in\nplace for Y2K and problems it may cause.\n\n   He also pointed out that a 22-member unit that specializes in\nassisting after terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass\ndestruction is now in place at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.
