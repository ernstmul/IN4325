Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ More than a year after a Manhattan couple argued with\ntheir landlord and then disappeared, the landlord, Robert\nRodriguez, was arrested Monday, and investigators searched his\nOrange County home, as well as the apartment building where the\ncouple lived.\n\n   Rodriguez, who had refused to allow the police to search his\nproperty, was not charged in connection with the mysterious\ndisappearance of his tenants, but with a variety of ``white-collar\ncrimes,'' including tax fraud and grand larceny, according to\nlaw-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n   In a brief statement, the New York Police Department\nacknowledged only that Rodriguez was in custody, that two search\nwarrants had been executed, and that ``Mr. Rodriguez owns the\nbuilding at 76 Pearl St. where Michael Sullivan and Camden Sylvia\nresided prior to their disappearance on November 7, 1997.''\n\n   The couple were last seen in a video store after arguing with\nRodriguez over the lack of heat in their apartment on Pearl Street,\nin the financial district. Rodriguez himself disappeared for two\nweeks shortly after friends discovered the couple were missing. He\nthen reappeared without explaining his absence.\n\n   Since then, Rodriguez has declined to cooperate with police\nseeking to find Ms. Sylvia, 36, an artist and real estate agent,\nand her companion, Sullivan, 54, an actor and art-gallery worker.\nIn particular, he has refused to let the police search his\nproperty. Frustrated investigators have even flown over the\nseven-acre Orange County home in helicopters and sent dogs sniffing\nfor anything that might provide the basis for a search warrant.\n\n   Law-enforcement officials said the search warrants were executed\nshortly after Rodriguez's arrest Monday _ one for Rodriguez's home\nin Slate Hill and the other for the Pearl Street apartment\nbuilding.\n\n   In the course of searching for evidence of the white-collar\ncrimes, investigators could presumably look for clues concerning\nthe whereabouts of Ms. Sylvia and Rodriguez. But since search\nwarrants are narrowly drawn, investigators might be confined to\nRodriguez's house, or even parts of his house, rather than the\nentire property of the Slate Hill estate and the Pearl Street\nbuilding.\n\n   Joseph Marro, Rodriguez's lawyer, declined to comment\nimmediately on the arrest, saying he had not heard from Rodriguez.\n\n   Jerry Goldfeder, the lawyer for the families of Ms. Sylvia and\nSullivan, said: ``This is the first real break in 14 months in this\ncase. It's the first opportunity for the authorities to find\nsomething that may resolve the disappearance.''\n\n   On Monday night, six investigators were in Rodriguez's locksmith\nshop on the ground floor of the apartment building, taking out milk\ncrates full of items from the shop. Kim Magistro, a neighbor of the\nmissing couple, said the investigators were also questioning Gina\nDeLarosa, a friend of Rodriguez who lives in a second-floor\napartment. Ms. Delarosa has an unlisted number and could not be\nreached for comment.\n\n   Outside the building, on three different floors, six yellow\nribbons in memory of the missing couple had been tied to the fire\nescapes by their friends.\n","Headline":"\nLANDLORD OF MISSING COUPLE IS HELD ON FRAUD CHARGES \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ More than a year after a Manhattan couple argued with\ntheir landlord and then disappeared, the landlord, Robert\nRodriguez, was arrested Monday, and investigators searched his\nOrange County home, as well as the apartment building where the\ncouple lived.\n","\n   Rodriguez, who had refused to allow the police to search his\nproperty, was not charged in connection with the mysterious\ndisappearance of his tenants, but with a variety of ``white-collar\ncrimes,'' including tax fraud and grand larceny, according to\nlaw-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n","\n   In a brief statement, the New York Police Department\nacknowledged only that Rodriguez was in custody, that two search\nwarrants had been executed, and that ``Mr. Rodriguez owns the\nbuilding at 76 Pearl St. where Michael Sullivan and Camden Sylvia\nresided prior to their disappearance on November 7, 1997.''\n","\n   The couple were last seen in a video store after arguing with\nRodriguez over the lack of heat in their apartment on Pearl Street,\nin the financial district.
