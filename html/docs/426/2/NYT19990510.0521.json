Police Department, Officer Sado got his first\npolice-issue, bullet-proof vest Monday morning. It's a custom-job,\nleaving plenty of room for his legs _ all four of them.\n\n   Sado, two other Boynton Beach police dogs and all 16 of the Palm\nBeach County sheriff's K-9 unit have been fitted for the $350\nspecial vests courtesy of a canine-loving chiropractor and his\nwife.\n\n   Gary and Raelynn Gagliardi say their heartstrings _ and their\npurse strings _ were tugged after they heard about Solo, a police\ndog killed in the line of duty in New Jersey. After Solo's death,\nthe local humane society raised money to buy a vest for the rest of\nthe department's four-legged unit.\n\n   Since then, dog lovers like the Gagliardis have stepped forward\nin communities nationwide, hoping to pay for doggie vests that\ndepartments either can't afford or find too embarrassing to ask the\npublic to pay for. The Gagliardis' bill to suit up 19 dogs topped\n$5,600.\n\n   Sado has worked for years unscathed. But at least two police\ndogs in Palm Beach County have died. Smokey, with Boynton Beach's\nK-9 Unit, was shot in 1981 while pursuing a criminal. Cello, who\nworked for Delray Beach police, died in 1984 from internal injuries\nhe suffered when he caught two hubcap thieves.\n\n   Last year, police dog deaths hit an all-time high of at least\neight, said Russell Hess, executive director of the U.S. Police\nCanine Association. This year, the association says two dogs have\ndied.\n\n   Solo, a 3-year-old German shepherd working for the Asbury Park,\nN.J., police, was brought in to break a 12-hour standoff between\npolice and a gunman holed up in an apartment. Solo went in and\nwithin minutes, the dog responsible for the capture of 19 criminals\nwas fatally shot.\n\n   Though a vest wouldn't have saved him (he was shot in the head),\nhis death spurred the local humane society to provide vests for\nevery police dog in the state. Since then, pet lovers from coast to\ncoast have picked up the cause, Hess said.\n\n   Dog vests have been around for a few years, but only now has\ntechnology made them truly feasible, said Sgt. Bob Anderson, who\nheads the sheriff's K-9 unit.\n\n   ``The first ones were quite heavy and the dogs might not have\nbeen able to perform with the weight and heat,'' he said.\n\n   The vests Sado and Kazan sported Monday weigh a couple of pounds\nat most.
