Barringer spokespersons said officials then have an idea\nof the type of explosives or drugs that have been found, making it\neasier for them to assess the potential danger of suspicious\npackages or people.\n\n   Among the product's features are its mobility and reliability,\nBarringer officials said. Even an expert bombmaker will leave trace\nresidue 95 percent of the time, said Mark Elliott, a company\nspokesman.\n\n   Barringer has marketed the machine to airports and national\ngovernment agencies, but said it also expected schools to be\ninterested in the device.\n\n   The machine's mobility could allow school administrators to\nexamine hundreds of lockers, possible storage units for drugs and\nexplosives, Wood said.\n\n   He said schools could test the outsides of lockers and, based on\nthe evidence, either confront the student, open the locker or place\nthe student under surveillance. Wood said he would recommend\ncleaning the locker completely if trace residue is found and then\ntesting a week later for a more accurate reading.\n\n   The device is currently priced at $20,000, but Barringer said\nthe company is working to make it more affordable, particularly to\nstate law enforcement agencies.\n\n   The Sabre2000 works much like other detection tools, like\ndrug-sniffing dogs. But Wood pointed out one advantage of the\ndevice:\n\n   ``Dogs can't tell you what they're sniffing,'' he said.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   A new hand-held device that the manufacturer says will detect\ntrace residue from explosives, narcotics or chemical weapons was\nunveiled on Thursday in the fight the war against drugs and\nterrorism.\n","\n   Approximately the size of a hand-held vacuum cleaner, the\nIONSCAN Sabre2000 was designed by the New Jersey-based Barringer\nTechnologies, Inc., to detect the smallest of physical particles\nand the faintest of vapors.\n","\n   Law enforcement, customs, security officials and school\nadministrators can use the device rather easily in a variety of\nways, said Ken Wood, Barrringer's president.\n","\n   The machine works when a swab of paper with trace residue is\ninserted into the machine for a reading, which takes about 20\nseconds.
