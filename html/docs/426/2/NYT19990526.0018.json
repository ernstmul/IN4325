Times News Service clients)  \n By PAT FLANNERY  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   NACO, Ariz. _ A border tunnel apparently used to smuggle\nhundreds of pounds of cocaine into the United States was slammed\nshut by federal agents Tuesday after dawn raids at eight locations\nthroughout southern Arizona.\n\n   The raids came in the wake of federal indictments charging 13\npeople with cocaine trafficking and conspiracy, U.S. Attorney Jose\nde Jesus Rivera said.\n\n   The indicted, nine of whom were arrested Tuesday, were described\nby Rivera as key players in a ring that transported drugs _ mostly\ncocaine _ through the tunnel for various Mexican drug cartels.\n\n   The 4-foot-high tunnel traveled for roughly 40 yards on the\nArizona side of the border, leading to a vacant blue and white\nhouse trailer along the border road in Naco.\n\n   Guadalupe Gonzalez, special agent in charge of the FBI in\nArizona, said an elite unit of the Mexican attorney general's\noffice was sent from Mexico City to serve search warrants at a\nMexican house only yards from the border where the tunnel is\nthought to start. The house was searched Tuesday evening, but no\nadditional arrests were made.\n\n   The Naco tunnel is the fifth found in Arizona in the 1990s.\nThree have been uncovered in Nogales _ two of those in January _\nand one was found in Douglas in 1990.\n\n   ``If I were a betting man, I'd say there are probably quite a\nfew more,'' conceded Thomas Raffanello, special agent in charge of\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration for Arizona.\n\n   Raffanello speculated that some tunnels probably have existed\nfor years, concealing past smugglers who moved everything from\nChinese immigrants to liquor into this country. It might also have\nbeen used to send drug profits south into Mexico.\n\n   Like many border regions, southeastern Arizona has a history of\nimmigrant and drug smuggling dating back decades. Recently, the\nproblem has become acute as other parts of the border in Arizona,\nTexas and California are clamped tighter with extra agents and\nsmuggling detection technology.\n\n   While some Naco residents said Tuesday that they were unaware of\nsignificant drug trafficking in town, border law enforcement\nagencies have long noted a rise in drug smuggling in and around the\nsmall, dusty village that straddles the border south of Bisbee.\n\n   Some smugglers drive drugs across in cars. Others backpack it\nacross the desert, or lead horse trains laden with bales of\nmarijuana.\n\n   Ron Sanders, chief of the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, also\nsaid his agents ``have been shot at in that area, and been rocked\nin that area.''\n\n   The Naco tunnel is not as sophisticated as the nearby Douglas\ntunnel, whose entrance in Mexico was under a hydraulically lifted\npool table in a home owned by a reputed drug kingpin. That tunnel\nalso had a rail inside to help haul dope, and ended inside a\nDouglas warehouse.\n\n   Gonzalez said the Naco version is about 5 feet wide and has a\ndirt floor. It is shored up throughout by timbers and has lighting\nstrung along the ceiling, giving it the feel of a mine shaft. It\nstarts in the Mexican residence and ends underneath the raised\nfloor of the vacant trailer. Authorities have not disclosed the\nowner of the Mexican property.\n\n   Investigators began suspecting a tunnel in the area in December\n1996 when a task force seized 5{ tons of cocaine in a Tucson\nwarehouse. Since then, the probe resulted in the seizure of an\nadditional 2,668 pounds of cocaine and $1.5 million in cash.\n\n   Nonetheless, Raffanello said, agents ``had no physical proof\nthat a tunnel existed'' until it was unearthed Tuesday. Though the\ntrailer and other homes have been under surveillance off and on for\nmonths, the tunnel had never actually been seen.\n\n   On Tuesday, agents dug underneath the trailer to find a wooden\nhatch under about 6 inches of dirt. The hatch covered an opening\nroughly 9 feet above the floor of the tunnel.\n\n   The tunnel heads directly south under the huge border fence\ndividing Naco, Arizona, from its counterpart of the same name in\nthe Mexican state of Sonora.\n\n   Dick Peacock, who lives next door to the tunnel, said the\ntrailer at 2107 W. Hogan St. had been vacant for several years.\nNonetheless, law enforcement officials who placed the trailer under\nsurveillance believe loads of drugs were moved through the tunnel\nand into vehicles parked at the trailer in the dead of night.\n\n   Peacock, a retiree who has lived in the trailer next door for 10\nyears, said he felt ``stupid. I didn't know anything was going\non.''\n\n   The first Peacock knew of local drug activities came about 6\na.m. Tuesday when two U.S. Customs helicopters and a state\nDepartment of Public Safety chopper broke the morning silence.\n\n   The helicopters churned overhead as members of local, state and\nfederal SWAT teams began their assaults on various locations where\nsuspects were believed to be living.\n\n   Agents zeroed in on the trailer as well as two other Naco\nresidences. Search warrants also were served in Tucson, Sierra\nVista and Bisbee.\n\n   Each of the locations was guarded by some of the three dozen\nheavily armed FBI, DEA, Border Patrol and Customs agents who took\npart.\n\n   Residents near the tunnel entrance were shooed out of the area\nfor several hours as bomb detection experts and drug-sniffing dogs\ninspected the property.  \n","Headline":"\nU.S. AGENTS SHUT DOWN BORDER TUNNEL IN COCAINE SMUGGLING PROBE \n","Text":["\n   NACO, Ariz. _ A border tunnel apparently used to smuggle\nhundreds of pounds of cocaine into the United States was slammed\nshut by federal agents Tuesday after dawn raids at eight locations\nthroughout southern Arizona.\n","\n   The raids came in the wake of federal indictments charging 13\npeople with cocaine trafficking and conspiracy, U.S. Attorney Jose\nde Jesus Rivera said.\n","\n   The indicted, nine of whom were arrested Tuesday, were described\nby Rivera as key players in a ring that transported drugs _ mostly\ncocaine _ through the tunnel for various Mexican drug cartels.\n","\n   The 4-foot-high tunnel traveled for roughly 40 yards on the\nArizona side of the border, leading to a vacant blue and white\nhouse trailer along the border road in Naco.\n","\n   Guadalupe Gonzalez, special agent in charge of the FBI in\nArizona, said an elite unit of the Mexican attorney general's\noffice was sent from Mexico City to serve search warrants at a\nMexican house only yards from the border where the tunnel is\nthought to start.
