Colin Bessonette will try to get\nan answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail\nhim at\n\n   q&a(AT)ajc.com\n\n   Q: I wanted to see Julie Andrews in ``Victor/Victoria'' in\nHouston, but that performance was canceled because of her throat\nsurgery. Since then I've heard she will never sing again. What's\nthe story?\n\n   A: Andrews underwent throat surgery in 1997 to remove\nnon-cancerous nodules in her throat. She says it was described to\nher as a routine procedure. Now, two years later, she remains\nunable to sing and is contemplating a lawsuit. ``It is in the hands\nof lawyers and we will make some decisions,'' she told London's\nDaily Telegraph in February. Her husband, director Blake Edwards,\nsaid last year he didn't think she would ever sing again. ``If you\nheard her voice, you would weep,'' he said. ``It's an absolute\ntragedy.'' Andrews, who was said at the time to be angered by\nEdwards' comments, remains hopeful that her condition can be\nreversed. ``I have to be optimistic,'' she told the Telegraph. ``I\nthink to some degree I'm in a form of denial about it. If I could\nnot sing with an orchestra . . . I think I would be devastated. . .\n. Right now I simply can't contemplate it. I don't want to say that\nI never can.''\n\n   Q: I bought my first Big Game lottery ticket recently. The odds\nof winning the least amount ($1) by getting only the Big Money Ball\nis given as 1:62. Since there are 36 numbers from which to choose\none number, shouldn't it be 1:36?\n\n   A: When calculating the odds for the $1 prize in the Big Game,\nthe formula is determined by the odds of getting one gold ``Big\nMoney'' ball correct within a field of 36, multiplied by the odds\nof getting the five white balls in a field of 50 incorrect. So the\nodds indeed are 1:62.\n\n   Q: Organic gardening often utilizes cow, sheep and/or other\nanimal manure as fertilizers. Does this make the risk of E. coli or\nother viral or bacterial exposure a possibility on the vegetables\nharvested from that soil?\n\n   A: It's possible. Organic production does in fact increase some\nrisks, said Paul Guillebeau, entomologist with the University of\nGeorgia Extension Service. In many cases, ``organic'' means that\nthe foods were grown with animal manures instead of chemical\nfertilizers. So the risks from pesticides may be reduced, but the\npossibility of contamination with fungal toxins, such as aflatoxin,\nmay be increased, Guillebeau said, citing research by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration. Animal manure is the primary reservoir for\na virulent strain of E. coli. In 1996, the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed nearly 2,500 cases of\nthis virulent strain, along with 250 deaths. Although organic foods\nmade up only 1 percent of the U.S. food supply during that time,\norganics were implicated in 8 percent of the confirmed cases.\n\n   While Guillebeau said he was not condemning organic foods, he\nadded that organic producers may exacerbate the problems because\nthey typically don't use chlorinated water or other disinfectants\nbefore their products are sold.\n\n   Q: How are dogs trained to sniff out drugs?\n\n   A: A dog's sense of smell is said to be 50,000 times greater\nthan a human's, which enables it to detect microscopic scent\nparticles. Trainers and handlers of ``dedicated drugs dogs,'' as\nsuch sniffers are called, introduce them to the scent of a\nparticular controlled drug _ even small amounts of cocaine,\nmarijuana, heroin _ early in their training. The trainers and\nhandlers use play, praise and patience to encourage the dog's\nnatural foraging instincts. When the dog detects the drug's scent,\nit alerts its handler, and usually is rewarded with praise or its\nfavorite toy.\n\n   Commonly used sniffer breeds include Labrador retrievers,\nEnglish springer spaniels and German shepherds. Several companies,\nincluding the Vonderhaus Gill German Shepherd Training School in\nWapakoneta, Ohio, and Kontraband Interdiction & Detection Services\nof Modesto, Calif., train the dogs.\n\n   Q: A federal judge has fined the American Airlines pilots' union\nmore than $45 million for refusing his back-to-work order during\nthe February ``sickout.'' Where does that money go?\n\n   A: The Allied Pilots Union fine must be paid directly to AMR\nGroup, the parent of American Airlines.\n\n   Q: Before the days of cordless and cell phones, people were\nadvised to avoid talking on their telephones during thunder and\nlightning storms. Is there a similar danger if using cordless\nequipment?\n\n   A: Not if the person using the wireless phone is indoors and\nprotected, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation in Washington. It's not recommended when outdoors,\nhowever. A CTIA spokesman said you shouldn't have any piece of\nmetal touching or near your body when outdoors in a thunder or\nlightning storm. A mobile phone contains pieces of metal, and if\nyou're talking on it, you're holding the metal-containing device\nnext to your head. That's not a good idea, he said.\n\n   Q: What did Samuel R. Berger do before he became the national\nsecurity adviser for the United States?\n\n   A: During President Clinton's first term in office, Sandy\nBerger's title was deputy assistant to the president for national\nsecurity affairs. In that position, he served as chairman of the\nDeputies Committee of the National Security Council, the\nsub-Cabinet interagency group charged with coordination of foreign\npolicy. Before that, he was Clinton's senior foreign policy adviser\nduring the 1992 presidential campaign and assistant transition\ndirector for national security of the 1992 Clinton-Al Gore\ntransition.\n\n   Berger's prior experience in government includes having served\nas special assistant to former New York Mayor John Lindsay;\nlegislative assistant for former Sen. Harold Hughes (D-Iowa) and\nRep. Joseph Resnick (D-N.Y.); and deputy director of the State\nDepartment's policy planning staff.\n\n   He also worked in the State Department during the administration\nof President Jimmy Carter, and was a speechwriter in 1972 for\nGeorge McGovern's presidential campaign. Additionally, Berger\npracticed law with the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson\n(1973-77 and 1981-92). He received his BA degree from Cornell\nUniversity in 1967 and his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in\n1971.\n\n   Q: I saw that detectives in Texas were searching in a field for\nthe body of renowned atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Do you have any\ninformation?\n\n   A: On Easter weekend, federal authorities _ acting on\ninformation from seven-time felon Gary P. Karr, suspected as an\naccessory in the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair and her family _ dug\nup portions of a 5,000-acre ranch west of San Antonio. As last\nreport they were refusing to say what, if anything, they found.\n\n   The Austin Statesman-American reported that on March 24, Karr\nhad spent 13 hours voluntarily talking to investigators at his\napartment in Novi, Mich. While the newspaper said he didn't confess\nto the killings of O'Hair; her son, Jon Garth Murray; and the\ngranddaughter she adopted as her own daughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair,\nhe did admit to concealing bodies, hiding victims' property,\nacquiring vehicles and playing a key role in transferring $600,000\nto a San Antonio gold dealer. The San Antonio Express-News,\nmeanwhile, has quoted FBI agent William O'Leary as testifying that\nKarr has admitted an ``extensive role'' in the three deaths as well\nas that of one other person, and has told the FBI the city where\nthe victoms' bodies were buried.\n\n   Many questions in the case remain unanswered. David Roland\nWaters, a former O'Hair employee convicted in 1995 of stealing\n$54,000 from O'Hair's American Atheists organization, also is being\nquestioned. He is in jail in Austin after being arrested on weapons\ncharges and Karr, also arrested on weapons charges, is in jail in\nDetroit. Waters' Austin attorney, Patrick Ganne, said he believes\nauthorities are ``waiting for one to break,'' but he insisted that\nhis client has nothing to tell authorities.\n\n   Q: I've read a lot about NATO's military intervention in\nYugoslavia, but I haven't seen any explanation about its stated\nmotive or where it derives its authority. Can you elaborate?\n\n   A: The stated motive is safeguarding international peace and\nsecurity, as permitted under the U.N. Charter. Just before NATO\nbegan its bombardment campaign, A. Peter Burleigh, acting U.S.\nambassador to the United Nations, said the U.N. Security Council\ngave NATO that authority in October when it called for a cease-fire\nin Kosovo under the council's Chapter VII, or war-making,\nauthority.\n\n   Russia and China have voiced strong opposition, saying NATO's\nclaim to be safeguarding international peace and security is\nforbidden to regional alliances without specific authority from the\nSecurity Council. But 13 of NATO's 19 members are participating in\nthe attacks on Yugoslav military forces, and three of the five\nSecurity Council members with veto power over resolutions _ the\nUnited States, Britain and France _ are participants in the NATO\nbombing campaign. So Russia and China are making little headway.\n\n   Q: Is Andrea Koppel of CNN related to Ted Koppel? It's not a\ncommon name.\n\n   A: She's Ted's daughter.\n\n   Q: Equifax recently ran a full-page newspaper ad saying it has a\nhistory of ``100 years in business changing the shape of global\ncommerce.'' I've seen its headquarters building in Atlanta, but I\nhave no idea what the company does. Can you explain?\n\n   A: Its global operations involve the financial services, retail,\ncredit card, telecommunications/utilities, transportation,\ninformation technology and healthcare industries, as well as\ngovernment. Hoover's Handbook of American Business says Equifax,\nthe nation's largest consumer credit reporter, approves check\npurchases, processes credit card applications and transactions,\nprovides database marketing consulting services, and develops\ncredit-scoring software. Its customers run the gamut from banks and\nother financial institutions to hotels and retailers.\n\n   The company traces its roots to 1899, when brothers Cator and\nGuy Woolford started Retail Credit Co. in Atlanta. They compiled\ncredit records of local residences into their Merchants Guide,\nwhich they sold to retailers for $25 a year. The brothers extended\ntheir services to the insurance industry in 1901, investigating the\nbackgrounds of insurance applicants. After several decades, Retail\nCredit branched into other information sectors, and in 1976 changed\nits name to Equifax (short for ``equitability in the gathering and\npresentation of facts'').\n\n   There are two other large personal credit reporting bureaus are\nTransUnion and Experian, formerly known as TRW.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   Have a question about the news?
