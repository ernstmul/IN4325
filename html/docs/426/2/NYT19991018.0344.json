A couple of small\ndogs _ beagles wearing green coats with the words Beagle Brigade.\nThey're working the baggage claim area where international\ntravelers pick up their luggage before going through customs.\n\n   Those dogs _ and their handlers _ are employees of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService. They're looking for what the USDA calls invasive species _\ncritters from another place that can cause trouble here.\n\n   Over the past 200 years, we've seen several thousand foreign\nplant and animal species become established in this country. The\nUSDA estimates they cause about $140 billion a year in damage.\n\n   Today, most of those invasive species arrive in the luggage of\ninternational travelers. The USDA works closely with commercial\nimporters of food, for example, to hold down dangers there. The\nmango you buy in the grocery store has been treated with hot water\nto kill any pests it might contain. The mango you pick in someone's\nback yard in Mexico is the one that has the bad news.\n\n   But if you try it at Intercontinental, you're going to have to\ndeal with Sam and April. And Dennis and Pat.\n\n   That's Dennis Brillhart and his beagle partner Sam, and Pat\nSheffield and April, the beagle. They're plant protection K-9\nofficers at Intercontinental. All of them.\n\n   Sheffield and Brillhart get paid more. But then again, both go\nbeyond the basic requirements for their job and have science-based\nmaster's degrees. April and Sam? They work for dog treats.\n\n     \nTHE WAY TO A DOG'S HEART ...   \n  \n\n   That's one of the reasons why beagles were chosen to do the job\nof sniffing out food brought into this country by travelers. Like\nmost dogs, they have a keen nose for odors. But additionally,\nbeagles just love to eat. So when they successfully ferret out food\nthey get a small dog treat to encourage them to find more.\n\n   Since they tend to average about 20 hits a day, the officers\nhave to cut usual dog treats into small bits. ``Otherwise,'' quips\nSheffield, ``the dogs would get too fat to fit into their cages.''\n\n   The beagles are trained to find not just food, but specific\nkinds of foods. You may legally bring into this country fish,\ncheese, bread, candy and a wide range of other food items _ just as\nlong as they are processed and won't cause problems.\n\n   So, the dogs, who come mostly from animal shelters all over the\nnation, go to school for about three months to learn to distinguish\nwhat odors are no-nos. Dogs are then matched with their handlers to\nlearn how to work together. When the dogs reach two-thirds of their\naverage 15-year lifespan, they are retired and homes are found for\nthem _ often with their long-time handlers.\n\n   Of course the dogs are only a tool, like the large X-ray\nmachines other USDA staffers at airport use to look inside checked\nbaggage. Say the dogs spot something and it's bananas. Now,\nbringing in bananas from South America is OK. Bananas brought from\nother areas aren't. A two-legged USDA staffer makes the final\njudgment.\n\n     \n'FESS UP OR FACE A FINE   \n  \n\n   Last week, I watched April and Sam work the baggage. Tails\nwagging, they found friends everywhere. Who's afraid of a 20-pound\nbeagle _ another reason why they're chosen. Usually, their handlers\ndon't mind if you give them a pat or two. But don't pat the larger\ndogs looking for drugs. A drug dog's reward isn't food but play\nfrom their handlers. Patting them distracts them from their work.\n\n   If April or Sam finds something in your luggage or back pack,\nthey'll just sit down. Sheffield or Brillhart will look at your\ncustoms form to see if you've declared that food. If there's no\nmention of it, they'll ask. Tell them. If you do, and it's\nsomething that shouldn't be coming into this country, they'll just\nconfiscate and destroy it. Try to conceal it and and you're going\nto be hit with an on-the-spot fine up to $100.\n\n   That happened to a woman the day I was there who concealed some\nfruit in a fried chicken container.\n\n   The dogs find all sorts of weird things. A couple of weeks ago,\nsomeone decided to bring back a live chicken in carry-on luggage.\nNot something exotic like a fighting cock.
