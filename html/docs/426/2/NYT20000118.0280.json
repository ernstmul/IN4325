Driving\ndown a one-way residential street in Holyoke in November 1997,\nHector Rodriguez was caught in a ``drug interdiction'' roadblock\norganized by the Holyoke police department, State Police and the\nlocal district attorney's office.\n\n   Of the 58 drivers pulled over, only Rodriguez was arrested on a\nnarcotics charge: possession of the butt ends of two marijuana\ncigarettes, which were found in his car by drug-sniffing dogs.\n\n   Rodriguez later sought to suppress the marijuana evidence,\narguing that the roadblock violated his constitutional right to be\nfree from arbitrary interference by police. A District Court judge\nruled in Rodriguez's favor, but the Hampden County District\nAttorney's office appealed to the state Appeals Court. The SJC\nchose independently to review the case.\n\n   In its ruling, the high court noted that the US Supreme Court\nhas allowed ``blanket suspicionless searches'' in cases where ``the\nrisk to public safety is substantial and real,'' such as at\nairports and courthouses.\n\n   And in 1985, the SJC ruled that sobriety roadblocks, in which\ncars are randomly stopped and checked to screen for drunk drivers,\nare necessary to reduce the ``carnage'' caused by drunken driving.\n\n   While acknowledging that ``(t)he drug problem in the United\nStates is certainly grave,'' the court concluded that drug\nroadblocks do not achieve an immediate enough effect to warrant\nthem.\n\n   ``Unlike (sobriety) roadblocks, narcotics interdiction\nroadblocks do not provide immediate protection to the public using\nthe roadways,'' the court wrote. ``Although apprehending narcotics\ntraffickers may have an eventual impact on the public safety, that\nimpact will necessarily be more remote and tenuous than the impact\nof removing impaired drivers from the road.''\n\n   The SJC noted Article 14 of the state constitution, which\nprohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, was written in\nresponse to British authorities conducting blanket searches of\ncolonists.\n\n   ``Viewed in light of the Commonwealth's history, it is clear\nthat the Holyoke roadblock is precisely the type of search that the\ndrafters of article 14 sought to prevent,'' the court wrote.\n\n   Holyoke is believed to be the first community in the state to\nhave set up a roadblock to screen for suspected drug dealers. In\nthe early 1990s, the city of Lawrence set up police checkpoints in\nan effort to crack down on illegal drug activity, but did not\nrequire motorists to stop or submit to searches. Instead, police\nrecorded registration numbers of passing cars.\n\n   The danger of such roadblocks, said Newman of the ACLU, ``is\nthat people could be stopped for anything. The same analysis that\nthe Commonwealth used to justify this to could be used to justify\nstops for parents who are behind in child support, people carrying\npornography, immigrants.''\n","Headline":"\nDRUG ROADBLOCKS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, COURT SAYS \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court says roadblocks set up for\nthe sole purpose of snaring suspected drug dealers are\nunconstitutional, saying they violate state protections against\nunreasonable searches and seizures.\n","\n   In reaching its decision, the Supreme Judicial Court rejected a\ngovernment argument that intercepting illegal drugs outweighs any\ninvasion of privacy posed by a roadblock.\n","\n   At the same time, the court reaffirmed the legality of\nroadblocks to check for drunk drivers, stressing that they, unlike\ndrug dealers, pose an immediate danger to the public.\n","\n   ``Absent an emergency or imminent threat to the lives and safety\nof the public, roadblocks to interdict contraband,'' including\ndrugs, guns, pornography and other unlawful items, violate\nconstitutional protections against unwarranted searches and\nseizures, said Justice Ruth Abrams, writing for the court in its\n15-page opinion.\n","\n   Civil libertarians praised the ruling Tuesday, which they said\nprotects citizens from government abuses.\n","\n   ``A police state can set up roadblocks,'' said William Newman,\ndirector of the western regional office of the American Civil\nLiberties Union, which wrote a friend-of-the-court brief opposing\ndrug roadblocks. ``A democracy is not supposed to set up a\nroadblock, seize citizens, and subject them to inspection and\ninterrogation unless there is an appropriate reason.''\n","\n   The ruling stems from what is believed to be the state's first\nroadblock set up specifically to catch drug traffickers.
