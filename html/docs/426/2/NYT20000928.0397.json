The court docket now has 47 cases. Typically, it ends up\nwith around 75.\n\n   As its term begins, the court itself has become a major\npolitical issue. Since the next president will likely nominate two\nto four justices, whoever wins in November could shape the court,\nnow beginning its 15th year under Chief Justice William Rehnquist,\nfor decades to come.\n\n   Four cases focusing on police power lead the current docket.\nJulie O'Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor, says they\n``may not have high visibility, but for most people, they may have\nmore of an impact'' than some of last term's hot-button cases.\n``They may burden the law-abiding, as well as the law-breaking,''\nshe explains.\n\n   In one case from Lago Vista, Texas, Gail Atwater was driving her\ntwo children home from soccer practice in 1997 when a toy fell off\ntheir pickup truck. Atwater then drove slowly around the\nneighborhood, letting the children stand on the seat to look out\nthe window for it.\n\n   When a police car passed her truck, Atwater said later, she knew\nshe was going to get a ticket for failing to buckle the youngsters'\nseatbelts. What she didn't expect was that the police would\nhandcuff her in front of the children and search her vehicle.\nAlthough they found only soccer equipment, the officers took\nAtwater to the local police station, where she was booked,\nphotographed and put into a holding cell. She later paid a $50\nfine.\n\n   Atwater filed a federal lawsuit against the city, attacking its\npolicy allowing such searches after minor traffic violations. A\nfederal judge ruled for the city, but the 5th Circuit Court of\nAppeals overruled the decision, saying the search policy was\nunconstitutional.\n\n   ``The issue here concerns everyone because it looks at how far\ncan police go after picking someone up for something minor, which\nsooner or later happens to most people,'' says Steven R. Shapiro,\nnational legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n   In an Indianapolis case, the court will look at the use of\npolice roadblocks on city streets in which an officer checks\nlicenses and registration while a drug-sniffing dog walks around\nthe stopped cars in search of drugs.\n\n   The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the checkpoints,\nsaying they were not designed to ensure highway safety, which would\nhave made them legal, but were used as ``a pretext for a dragnet\nsearch for criminals.''The Supreme Court in 1990 upheld\ndrunken-driving roadblocks as a legal method of removing hazardous\ndrivers from the roads, but lower courts have disagreed about the\nconstitutionality of drug roadblocks, which seek to detect illegal\ntrafficking, not drug-using drivers.\n\n   In another case under the Fourth Amendment's ban on\n``unreasonable searches and seizures,'' the court will examine the\ncontroversial practice of prosecuting pregnant women who use drugs\nor engage in other practices that might endanger their babies. The\ncourt will review the policy of a Charleston, S.C., city hospital\nthat allows tests of pregnant patients suspected of drug use and\nthen turns the results over to police if they test positive.\n\n   The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the practice, ruling\nthat the health problems caused by maternal drug use outweighed the\nintrusion suffered by the women whose urine was tested for drugs\nwithout their consent.\n\n   Finally, the justices will go high-tech when they consider\nwhether Florence, Ore., police needed a search warrant before using\na thermal-imaging device to detect heat patterns inside a house.\n\n   The imaging device has become popular with police trying to\ndetect indoor marijuana-growing operations that use high-intensity\nlights to speed the plants' growth.\n\n   The Supreme Court also will wade into environmental issues in\ntwo cases that will test the constitutional limits of the federal\ngovernment.\n\n   The first involves the Environmental Protection Agency's\nadoption in 1997 of tough new rules on smog-causing ozone and soot\nunder the 1990 Clean Air Act. The regulations, which would have\nthrown hundreds of urban counties out of compliance, were\nchallenged by a coalition of industry representatives.\n\n   In 1998, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia ruled that the EPA had acted unconstitutionally in\nimposing sweeping air-quality standards for those pollutants.\n\n   In the case, the Supreme Court also will consider whether the\ngovernment must take costs into account as well as benefits to\nsociety before it sets national air quality standards.\n\n   The other environmental case stems from an effort by the U.S.\nArmy Corps of Engineers to prevent 24 communities near Chicago from\ndumping garbage into a proposed landfill. The area now has inland\nwaters that are home to blue herons and other migratory birds.\n\n   The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Corps has\njurisdiction over the area and may protect it under the federal\ngovernment's authority to regulate interstate commerce. The court\nsaid the wetlands area contributes to the economy because many\nout-of-state travelers drive there each year to hunt and view the\nbirds.\n\n   In a First Amendment free-speech case, the justices will decide\nwhether people may be sued for disclosing the contents of telephone\ncalls that were illegally intercepted and recorded by someone else.\n\n   The Wilkes-Barre, Penn., case is expected to help define the\nbalance between the First Amendment rights of Americans to\ndisseminate information and state and federal wiretapping laws\naimed at preventing people from intercepting private conversations.\n\n   The case involve a tape recording made illegally of a cell phone\nconversation that was later given to radio station WILK, which\nbroadcast it repeatedly.\n\n   The case could have an important impact on the press because\nnews reporters sometimes use information that may have been\nobtained by third parties through questionable means.\n\n   The court's decision could also affect a lawsuit brought by Rep.\nJohn A. Boehner, R-Ohio, against Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.\n\n   In December 1996, a Florida couple illegally taped a cell phone\nconversation in which then House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Boehner and\nother Republican leaders were heard discussing matters related to\nan ethics case against Gingrich. The couple gave the tape to\nMcDermott, who passed it on to the House ethics committee.\n\n   Several news organizations published transcripts of the\nconversations. A U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia later ruled that the Boehner suit could go forward.\n\n   In another case with First Amendment implications, the justices\nwill examine a voter-initiated amendment to the Missouri\nConstitution that required the state's 11-member congressional\ndelegation to either support a term-limits amendment to the U.S.\nConstitution or be labeled on future ballots as having\n``disregarded voters' instruction on term limits.''\n\n   The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found the law to be a form of\ngovernment-compelled speech that violates the First Amendment.\n\n   In a Tennessee case, the justices will examine whether a state\nhigh school association can bar coaches at private schools from\nrecruiting athletes from public schools.\n\n   A federal district court ruled that the association's policy\nviolated the coaches' First Amendment rights to free speech.\nHowever, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reversed\nthe district court ruling.\n\n   In another case involving athletes, the justices will decide if\nthe Professional Golf Association violated the Americans with\nDisabilities Act when it barred Casey Martin _ a partially disabled\ngolfer _ from riding a cart during tournaments.\n\n   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the PGA argument that\nall tournament golfers must play by the same rules, which includes\nwalking about five miles a day on sometimes hilly courses.\n\n   The high court will also explore a distinction in federal\nimmigration law between out-of-wedlock children born overseas to\nAmerican mothers and those born to American fathers.\n\n   Under the law, a child born to an unmarried American mother is\nconsidered a U.S. citizen at birth. But a child whose mother is a\nforeign national and whose father is an American is considered a\nnoncitizen. For the child to become a citizen, the American father\nmust formally acknowledge paternity before the child is 18 years\nold.\n\n   The case involves a 31-year-old man born in Vietnam and raised\nby his American father, who never asked the government to make him\na citizen. Now the son faces deportation to Vietnam after being\nconvicted on an assault charge. The father challenged the statute,\nsaying it violates the constitutional requirement that laws treat\nmen and women equally.\n\n   (Mark Helm can be reached at 202-298-6920 or at the e-mail\naddress mark(at)hearstdc.com)\n","Headline":"\n      POLICE POWER, ENVIRONMENT, SPEECH ISSUES TOP COURT'S DOCKET \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ After tackling such volatile issues as gay rights\nand late-term abortion during its last session, the Supreme Court\nopens a new season Monday with far-reaching but less dramatic cases\ninvolving police power, the environment and free speech.\n","\n   ``Last year was the fireworks, once-in-a-decade kind of term,\nwhereas this time around the court has slowed things down and is\nlooking at less controversial issues,'' says John Roberts Jr., a\nSupreme Court expert here.\n","\n   But he notes that the court still has time to add high-profile\ncases.
