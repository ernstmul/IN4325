Six other would-be death row escapees with Gurule\nsurrendered in the prison compound when guards opened fire.\n\n   Within minutes, correctional officers _ many who live in houses\nnext to the prison _ were racing to pre-arranged positions,\nfollowing a plan they routinely practice in escape drills.\nTelephones quickly rang in houses near the prison, notifying\nresidents that a prisoner was loose.\n\n   ``There is an extensive and comprehensive battle plan that\nswings into effect immediately'' after an escape, said Glen\nCastlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal\nJustice.\n\n   In the minutes and hours after the first shots rang out hundreds\nof corrections officers were deployed in a containment plan that\nthey hope has trapped Gurule within a 17,000-acre expanse of woods,\nbogs, and farmland bordered by three roads and an arching bend of\nthe Trinity River.\n\n   ``We don't search like you would for a lost child, where you\nlock arms in arm and search every square inch,'' Castlebury said.\nInstead, they have created a spider's web of trails throughout\ntheir search zone, and they are waiting for their missing killer to\ncross one of its strands.\n\n   ``The purpose becomes containment. As long as he's on that land\nand stays there, we will outwait him. We have more patience, we\nhave more food.''\n\n   The battle plan has been battle-tested, Castlebury said. The\nprison system has a perfect record in capturing escaped prisoners,\nhe said, and the inside joke at the prisons is that escapees are\nalways caught within three hours or three miles.\n\n   But Gurule, on death row for shooting Minas ``Mike'' Piperis\nwhile robbing Piperis' U&I Restaurant in Corpus Christi, has been\nmissing for four days, and nobody knows how far he has gone. Maybe\nhe raced to the nearest road and jumped into a car before the swarm\nof correctional officers could seal off the area.\n\n   Prison officials say they are exploring that possibility, but\nthey believe he's laying low nearby, playing the needle in the\n17,000-acre haystack surrounding the Ellis Unit, 12 miles north of\nHuntsville.\n\n   Dogs pulling long hours\n\n   Inside the Ellis Unit, at the command center set up to lead the\nsearch effort, prison officials coordinate the roughly 500 officers\nand 70 dogs who form the bulk of their force.\n\n   Most of the 500 officers involved in the hunt at any one time\nare kept out of the search area, so that their scent will not\nconfuse those doing the actual hunting: the dogs.\n\n   Eleven ``tracks,'' or trails have been set up within the\nperimeter, along with others skirting the riverbanks, Castlebury\nsaid. Dog teams _ 10 tracking hounds loping ahead of two officers _\nhave been tracing those tracks up to four times a day. Four teams\nat a time are out in the search area around the clock, Castlebury\nsaid, waiting for the dogs to sniff out evidence that the inmate\nhas moved across one of the tracks.\n\n   ``These dogs are not scent-specific, meaning you don't have them\nsmell the inmate's pillow case,'' Castlebury said. ``They will\nfollow any scent.''\n\n   Sgt. Tommy Freeman, who manages the dog teams at the prison,\nsaid his dogs tracked Gurule's scent to a highway about a\nquarter-mile east of the prison, where it abruptly stopped.\n\n   ``Unlike a lot of people think, there are a lot of situations\nwhere we can have a problem (tracking),'' Freeman said.\n\n   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said it was possible the\ninmate had stepped into a pile of cow manure, which would throw off\nthe dogs' ability to track his scent.\n\n   Castlebury said they can't be sure it was Gurule's trail.\n\n   ``It's a case of 'Who knows?' `` he said.\n\n   Meanwhile, officers are positioned every 25 yards on five or six\nmiles of farm roads and state highway on the southern and western\nsides of the perimeter, keeping an eye on the roads and checking\nevery passing vehicle.\n\n   Overhead, two helicopters _ one from the Texas Department of\nPublic Safety and one from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization\nService _ have flown intermittently over the area, hoping Gurule's\nbody heat will trip their infrared sensors.\n\n   Those sensors won't work if Gurule is dead, however. Prison\nauthorities found blood near the razor-wire-topped fence that\nGurule scaled, but they have said they don't think he was shot.\n\n   Until they find evidence that the 29-year-old convict somehow\nslipped out of the area before they could establish their perimeter\n_ or until enough time has passed to convince them he's gone _\nprison officials will stick to the plan.\n\n   Larry Todd, another prison spokesman, called it a ``combination\nof scent and tracks and good old country boy hunches.''\n\n   Hacksaw blade discovered\n\n   Prison officials have launched an investigation into how the\ninmates, who all had greater freedom of movement because they\nworked as orderlies on the cellblock, were able to slip into the\nexercise yard, cut through the fence around it, and remained\nundetected on a rooftop for hours.\n\n   After Gurule's escape, guards quickly discovered they'd been\nhad: the sleeping forms in the inmates bunks were really rolled-up\nbedding. On Monday, prison officials announced they found a hacksaw\nblade on the roof where the inmates hid before the escape attempt.\n\n   ``It was not brought in from the outside as far as we can\ndetermine,'' Fitzgerald said. ``It's the kind we have at our\nindustries. We have a bus barn here, a furniture shop. The fact we\nhave a saw blade is not unusual. We are concerned, obviously, how\nthis occurred, but first we have to find him.''\n\n   Another part of the search involves detective work. When a\nHuntsville resident reported the theft of a blue GMC pickup truck\nfrom the parking lot of a local business, the police passed on the\ninformation to the command center.\n\n   Investigators are checking ``every contact, every family member,\nevery friend'' for leads, Castlebury said. The investigation has\nalso included poring over Gurule's visitor list and correspondence\nlist, looking for evidence that he had help from the outside.\n\n   ``Frankly, they don't have any leads there,'' Todd said.\n\n   So they keep running the dogs, checking motorists' trunks, and\nwaiting for Gurule _ if he's in there _ to move.\n\n   ``It's very frustrating,'' Gary Johnson, director of the prison\nsystem, said late Monday afternoon after another full day of\nsearching. ``But we can't quit just because we're frustrated. We\njust have to be patient and press on.''\n\n   Johnson repeated his belief that Gurule remained within the\nsearchers' perimeter.\n\n   ``If I knew he was not here, we would pull out,'' he said. ``But\nwe have no plans now of pulling out.
