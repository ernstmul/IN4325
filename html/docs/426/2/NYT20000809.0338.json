Times News Service   \n\n   MOSCOW _ Russian law enforcement officials said Wednesday they\nhad detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the\nterrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed\nseven people and wounded 97 Tuesday evening.

The police and\nprosecutors also said they had no evidence of Chechen involvement.\n\n   Putin's admonition reflected the political sensitivities of\nRussian leaders who are trying to build a viable new government in\nChechnya, said Alexei Zudin, a political analyst.

At Moscow's Kazansky railway station police\nreportedly found nearly nine pounds of TNT as well as seven\ndetonators, which were not hooked up to the explosives.\n\n   Wednesday morning, Muscovites were back underground as usual,\nwith thousands of them passing through the reopened, though charred\npassageways beneath Pushkin Square, where vendors picked through\nthe debris in their shops.\n\n   ``Of course we will go back to work here,'' said one middle-aged\nwoman sorting through the lingerie in her darkened kiosk. ``And of\ncourse we are scared,'' she added.\n\n   The low granite walls along the exits from the underground\npassageways had already become memorial altars, where friends,\nrelatives and passersby laid carnations and lilies to express their\nsympathy for those who died.
