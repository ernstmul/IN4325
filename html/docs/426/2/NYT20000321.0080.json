Hank Sanders of Selma\nand J.L. Chestnut, according to the U.S. Marshal's Office.\n\n   Imfeld said three U.S. marshals were in White Hall looking for a\nToyota 4-Runner registered to Al-Amin at a White Hall address on\nMonday when, at about 5:30 p.m. CST, they were fired upon by\n.223-caliber rounds. The Fulton County deputies were shot with\nrounds from a .223-caliber assault rifle.\n\n   ``At that point, a 1985 Cadillac came by and picked up the\n(unknown) shooter, drove down County Road 40 and pulled into a\nhouse at 531 County Road,'' Imfeld said. Imfeld said he was not\nsure why the car pulled in at that house.\n\n   The car then circled around the town.\n\n   ``We found that very odd. We were looking to see if it was part\nof a scheme, if he was with them, or if it gave them an opportunity\nto draw attention away from where Al-Amin may have been,'' Imfeld\nsaid.\n\n   The FBI set up a roadblock and arrested six occupants of the\nCadillac, two of them juveniles.\n\n   Four were being held in federal custody in Montgomery today for\nquestioning for shooting at the marshals and possibly for harboring\nAl-Amin, Imfeld said. The juveniles were released to their parents.\n\n   About three hours after the marshals were initially shot at,\nmarshals were fired upon again, and Al-Amin was seen running into a\nwooded area at the corner of White Hall Road and County Road 80,\nImfeld said.\n\n   Vaughner said no one was injured in the exchange of gunfire.\n\n   About 100 law enforcement personnel, including dog teams, gave\nchase and Al-Amin ``basically ran out of the woods into the arms of\na deputy,'' Imfeld said. ``Within seconds there were about two\ndozen agents on him.''\n\n   The mayor of White Hall said today he has known Al-Amin since\nthe 1960s , when he was known as Black Panther leader H. Rap Brown.\n\n   Mayor John Jackson said he and Al-Amin met in 1965 and were\nmembers of the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, a nonviolent\nChristian organization that tried to put black candidates on the\nballot. The organization used the Black Panther emblem as a symbol.\n\n   ``About a year ago, (Al-Amin) came in to try to start up a\nmosque but there were not enough people,'' Jackson said. ``They\nopened a restaurant. It is the only one in town that does not sell\nalcohol.''\n\n   Jackson said Al-Amin came to White Hall ``about every two or\nthree months,'' but added that the last time he saw him was in\nJanuary.\n\n   Jackson said in the past he had Al-Amin talk to the children of\nWhite Hall about the dangers of drugs and alcohol.\n\n   ''We've been in the struggle for a long time but when someone\ncrosses the line, we have to deal with it,'' Jackson said.\n\n   FBI agents arrived in Lowndes County, Ala., about four days ago,\nsaid Vaughner. They suspected Al-Amin might return to his activist\nroots and knew that he had a vehicle registered in the area,\nVaughner said.\n\n   The Black Panther Party's origins are in Lowndes County. The\nanimal was adopted as a symbol of black voting rights after a mass\nmeeting in the county more than 30 years ago. The late civil rights\nactivist Stokely Carmichael left Lowndes County after that meeting\nand helped lead the Black Panther Party to national prominence.\n\n   Al-Amin had been the subject of a nationwide manhunt since\nThursday night. Deputy Richard Kinchen, 35, and Deputy Aldranon\nEnglish, 28, were trying to serve a warrant on Al-Amin. Kinchen\ndied; English is recovering from his injuries at Grady Memorial\nHospital.\n\n   Monday's arrest was the result of information investigators\nreceived soon after the deputies were shot, Atlanta Police Chief\nBeverly Harvard said at a late night news conference at City Hall\nEast.\n\n   FBI spokeswoman Celeste Armstead agreed: ``It was unbelievable\ncooperation between several agencies that worked hard to catch this\nman.''\n\n   After his arrest, FBI agents took Al-Amin, who was wearing a\nwhite shirt, sweat pants and sunglasses, to the Montgomery Police\nDepartment. He was fingerprinted and booked at the Montgomery City\nJail late Monday night.\n\n   Harvard said a handgun was found in the woods after Al-Amin's\narrest. She said it is not known whether the gun was used in the\nshooting earlier in the day.\n\n   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said English had expressed\nrelief about Al-Amin's arrest. ``He said, 'Tonight I can sleep.'''\n\n   ``I'm delighted that it happened in this time frame,'' the\nsheriff said, referring to today's funeral service for the slain\ndeputy. ``This will add a different air to the service. On a good\nday this would be a difficult service, this will help us through a\nbit.''\n\n   Harvard said Al-Amin will be arraigned in Alabama on federal\ncharges of firing on federal agents. A warrant has been issued in\nAtlanta charging him with murder and aggravated assault. He has\nalso been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.\n\n   Harvard said she does not know when Al-Amin will be returned to\nGeorgia.\n\n   Several other people were detained in White Hall, she said, ``as\nit relates to the possibility of their harboring a person that we\nhad a warrant on.'' About six people were being questioned but were\nnot under arrest as of Monday night, she said.\n\n   White Hall is a little country town located off State Highway\n80. It does not have stop lights or sidewalks.There is a town hall\nand church at the intersection of County Roads 23 and 30 and some\nhouses and general stores nearby in the town, which the mayor said\nhas a current population of about 1,800.\n\n   Cox writers Doug Payne and Mike Morris contributed to this\narticle.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   Law enforcement officers searched for a murder weapon today in a\nwooded area near White Hall, Ala., where Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin was\narrested Monday night.\n","\n   Authorities were still trying to determine how Al-Amin, who is\ncharged in the shooting death of a Fulton County sheriff's deputy\nand the wounding of a second deputy, got from Atlanta to White\nHall, said William Imfeld, special agent in charge of the FBI's\nMobile office.\n","\n   Al-Amin had been staying with a fellow Muslim in a rented house\nin White Hall, said Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner.\n","\n   Al-Amin was being represented at his arraignment hearing today\nin federal court in Montgomery by state Sen.
