For that reason, they have passed laws\nblocking seized property from going directly back to police, and\nmany states designate seizures to be used for other purposes, such\nas education.  \n\n   But a yearlong examination by The Kansas City Star reveals that\npolice agencies in every one of more than two dozen states checked\nby the newspaper have used federal law enforcement to circumvent\ntheir own laws and keep most of that money for themselves.  \n\n   It works this way: When police seize money, they call a federal\nagency instead of going to state court to confiscate it. An agency\nsuch as the Drug Enforcement Administration accepts the seizure,\nmaking it a federal case. The DEA keeps a cut of the money and\nreturns the rest to police. State courts _ and their generally\nmore-restrictive forfeiture laws _ are bypassed altogether.  \n\n   Law enforcement says that's not illegal and that without the\nmoney, police would be handcuffed in fighting crime. But millions\nof dollars that lawmakers in some states have designated for\neducation, drug treatment programs and other purposes instead end\nup back in the hands of police.  \n\n   For example:  \n\n   --A North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper stopped a driver\nlast year on Interstate 95 for tailgating. A police dog signaled\ndrugs were in the Toyota, where troopers found $105,700 and two\ngrams of marijuana. The driver denied owning either the drugs or\nthe money. The highway patrol gave the money to the DEA, which\nreturned more than $80,000 to the state patrol, even though North\nCarolina law generally requires sending seized money to education.  \n\n   -- In June a Georgia trooper stopped a 1996 Monte Carlo for\nspeeding on I-95. After the driver and passengers gave conflicting\nstories, the trooper searched the car and found a hidden\ncompartment containing $7,000, which the driver said was from\nsavings.  \n\n   The patrol turned over the money to the DEA, which in January\nreturned $5,440 to the patrol. Under Georgia law forfeited money\nshould go to the state's general fund.  \n\n   --In 1996, the Missouri Highway Patrol stopped a Volkswagen Golf\nfor speeding, searched it because the occupants seemed suspicious\nand found $24,000. No drugs were found and no one claimed the\nmoney. The patrol gave it to the DEA to be forfeited, the legal\nterm for confiscation.  \n\n   (The case took a bizarre turn last year when a family that\nbought the car at auction discovered an additional $82,000 in the\ngas tank. The DEA took that money, too.)  \n\n   Missouri law sends forfeiture money to a public school fund.  \n\n   Beyond the money diverted from public funds, critics are just as\ntroubled by the weakening of a basic American civil liberty _ the\nBill of Rights protection against improper search and seizure.  \n\n   Owners who want to recover seized property usually face a much\ntougher road in federal court than they would under their own state\nlaws. That continues despite a new federal law passed last month\nthat will place some limits on forfeiture.  \n\n   The federal hand-offs, critics say, also create an opportunity\nfor police to profit from their own actions. Indeed, they trace an\nincreasing outcry over aggressive or illegal searches by police\nnationwide back to the profit motive.  \n\n   ``If you think that by conducting an illegal search and seizing\npeople on the highway you can increase the number of times where\nyou can take assets, it is going to become a big motivating\nforce,'' said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil\nLiberties Union.  \n\n   This may be one of those rare issues that elicits protests\nacross the political spectrum _ from the ACLU to the National Rifle\nAssociation.  \n\n   Americans don't realize that forfeitures often occur to\n``ordinary people who happen to find themselves in a situation in\nwhich they are simply suspected of having been somehow involved in\ncriminal activity, whether those suspicions ever prove out or\nnot,'' said Roger Pilon, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a\nLibertarian think tank.  \n\n   ``The line between a free society and a police state is usually\nbroached in small steps.''  \n\n   But many police complain that state laws are too restrictive,\nsometimes preventing them from taking the money that fuels drug\noperations.  \n\n   Others readily admit they avoid state laws because they need to\nuse seized money to fight the war on drugs _ their own cities and\nstates may not provide the funding otherwise.  \n\n   ``A lot of state agencies, like the GBI, prefer to work federal\ncases because we know it will go directly into our asset forfeiture\nbank,'' said Mark Jackson, director of legal services for the\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation.  \n\n   Some federal officials contend the cases collected by the\nnewspaper prove nothing.  \n\n   ``In a country this big, you can find cases all over the lot,''\nsaid Jerry McDowell, director of the Justice Department's asset\nforfeiture and money laundering division. ``I don't think police\nagencies are in the business of profiting.''  \n\n   Besides, he said, it's legal for police to send seizures to\nfederal agencies because most state laws do not specifically\nprohibit that.  \n\n   ``We certainly don't want to subvert state law, and we don't\nwant states to subvert our law,'' McDowell said.  \n\n   But most states do prohibit simply handing off seizures _ their\nlaws give jurisdiction over seizures to state courts, The Star has\nfound.  \n\n   What that means, say legal experts and judges who have examined\nthe little-known state provisions, is that police cannot simply\nhand off seizures to federal agents to avoid state requirements.\nThey need a court order first.  \n\n   One federal court in a Louisiana case even derisively likened\nthe evasion maneuver to a trick football play. The court wrote:  \n\n   ``NFL sportscasters might call the handoff from the Sheriff's\nOffice to the DEA, followed by the lateral back from the DEA to the\nSheriff's Office, a `flea-flicker.' ''  \n\n   {( Begin optional trim )}\n\n   Forfeiture itself is not new _ many colonists fled England in\npart because the king's law allowed forfeiture, but it followed\nthem to America.  \n\n   John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of\nIndependence, was defended by John Adams when the Crown seized his\nship for failure to pay a despised tax on its cargo of Madeira\nwine.  \n\n   James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers\ndetermined forfeiture would be used only on a limited basis _ to\nseize foreign ships for failure to pay customs duties, for\nexample.  \n\n   As a result, the Bill of Rights protects Americans from illegal\nsearches and seizures: No person shall ``be deprived of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private\nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation.''  \n\n   Two hundred years later, much has changed with the advent of the\nwar on drugs.  \n\n   {( End optional trim )}\n\n   In passing a 1984 law, Congress thought that if federal and\nlocal law enforcement agencies cooperated more closely, they could\nshut down drug operations by confiscating dealers' money.  \n\n   Federal agencies would share assets they seized in drug busts\nwith local police who helped them.
