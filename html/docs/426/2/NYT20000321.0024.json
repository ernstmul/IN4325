Rap Brown, had been the subject of\na nationwide manhunt since Thursday night when two Fulton County\nsheriff's deputies were shot while trying to serve an arrest\nwarrant in Atlanta's West End.\n\n   Deputy Richard Kinchen, 35, died of his wounds; Deputy Aldranon\nEnglish, 28, is recovering from his injuries at Grady Memorial\nHospital.\n\n   Monday's arrest was the result of information investigators\nreceived soon after the deputies were shot, Atlanta Police Chief\nBeverly Harvard said at a late-night press conference at City Hall\nEast.\n\n   Al-Amin was located Monday afternoon at a house in White Hall,\nbetween Selma and Montgomery. As federal authorities closed in\naround 6:30 p.m., shots were fired, Harvard said.\n\n   Lowndes County Sheriff Willie Vaughner said no one was injured\nin the exchange of gunfire.\n\n   Al-Amin fled to some nearby woods, which were surrounded by law\nenforcement authorities. With the help of tracking dogs from the\nAlabama Department of Corrections, Al-Amin was flushed from the\nwoods and arrested without further incident, Harvard said.\n\n   FBI agents took Al-Amin, who was wearing a white shirt, sweat\npants and sunglasses, into custody at the Montgomery Police\nDepartment.\n\n   Harvard said a handgun was found in the woods after Al-Amin's\narrest. She said it is not known whether this gun was used in the\nshooting earlier in the day.\n\n   Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett said Deputy English had\nexpressed relief about Al-Amin's arrest. ``He said, `Tonight I can\nsleep.'''\n\n   ``I'm delighted that it happened in this time frame,'' the\nsheriff said, referring to today's funeral service for the slain\ndeputy. ``This will add a different air to the service. On a good\nday this would be a difficult service, this will help us through a\nbit.''\n\n   Harvard said Al-Amin will be arraigned in Alabama on federal\ncharges of firing on federal agents. A warrant has been issued in\nAtlanta charging him with murder and aggravated assault.\n\n   Harvard said she does not know when Al-Amin will be returned to\nGeorgia. She would not elaborate on how investigators tracked him\nto Alabama beyond saying that it was due to information they\nreceived early in the investigation.\n\n   Several other people were detained in White Hall, she said, ``as\nit relates to the possibility of their harboring a person that we\nhad a warrant on.'' About six people were being questioned but were\nnot under arrest as of Monday evening, she said.\n\n   Harvard said she does not know what connection Al-Amin has to\nthe White Hall area in general or specifically to the house where\nhe was found.\n\n   Al-Amin, as H. Rap Brown, was a field organizer for the Student\nNonviolent Coordinating Committee in Greene County, Ala., and\nworked to register voters in Lowndes County, then a segregationist\nand racist stronghold, in 1966 and 1967, according to historians.\n\n   The Black Panther Party had roots in Lowndes County. The panther\nwas adopted as a symbol of black voting rights after a mass meeting\nin the county more than 30 years ago.\n\n   The late civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael left Lowndes\nCounty after that meeting and helped lead the Black Panther Party\nto national prominence.\n\n   Auburn University history professor J. Wayne Flynt said the\nBlack Panthers capitalized on the Rev. Martin Luther King's\nSelma-to-Montgomery march, which passed through Lowndes County, and\norganized people who may have regarded the Panthers as part of\nKing's movement.\n\n   There is no Panther movement in Lowndes County today, Flynt\nsaid, but Al-Amin would likely still have friends there. ``What I'd\nthink you'd find is people who were personal friends of Brown and\nCarmichael.''\n\n   Harvard said she does not know how Al-Amin was able to travel\nfrom Atlanta to Alabama.
