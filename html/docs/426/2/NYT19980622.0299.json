Houston Chronicle \n\n   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court told the U.S.\ngovernment Monday to return most of the $357,000 in cash it seized\nfrom an international traveler who failed to report all the money\nhe was carrying.\n\n   In its 5-4 decision, the court struck down as unconstitutionally\nexcessive the U.S. government's seizure of $357,144 from Hosep\nBajakajian, who willfully violated a federal law that requires\noverseas travelers to tell federal authorities when they are\ntransporting more than $10,000 in currency.\n\n   The law, designed to trap drug dealers, requires that people\nfound to have violated the reporting requirement surrender any\nproperty ``involved in such offense'' to the federal government.\n\n   In a decision that united its most conservative and liberal\nmembers, the court said the amount of the forfeiture violated the\nEighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines because the total\nseized was ``grossly disproportionate'' to the offense of not\nreporting it.\n\n   The case arose on June 9, 1994, when Bajakajian, his wife and\ntwo daughters were waiting at Los Angeles International Airport to\nboard a flight to Italy. Customs inspectors, using\ncurrency-sniffing dogs, discovered about $230,000 in the family's\nchecked baggage.\n\n   Customs inspectors then approached Bajakajian and his wife,\ninformed them of the reporting requirement and asked them if they\nhad any more money. Bajakajian said he had $8,000 and his wife\nanother $7,000.\n\n   However, a search of their carry-on bags, wallet and purse\nbrought the total yield to $357,144. The inspectors seized the\nmoney and arrested Bajakajian.\n\n   Bajakajian, who admitted a ``distrust for the government'' after\ngrowing up as an Armenian minority in Syria, pleaded guilty to\nfailing to report the currency, but the government was never able\nto connect the cash to any illegal enterprise.\n\n   A federal district court ruled forfeiture of all the money would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment and ordered the government to return\nall but $15,000 of the seized currency.\n\n   The court also fined Bajakajian $5,000 and placed him on\nprobation for three years. Customs officials appealed the decision\nto try to keep all the seized cash.\n\n   Justice Clarence Thomas, among the high court's most\nconservative members, was joined in his majority decision by\nliberal Justice John Paul Stevens and three other colleagues.\n\n   Thomas said Bajakajian's offense was ``minimal;'' hurt no one\nand, if undetected, would have deprived the government only of the\ninformation that $357,144 had left the United States.\n\n   ``There is no inherent proportionality in such a forfeiture,''\nThomas wrote. ``It is impossible to conclude for example that the\nharm respondent caused is anywhere near 30 times greater than that\ncaused by a hypothetical drug dealer who willfully fails to report\ntaking $12,000 out of the country in order to purchase drugs.''\n\n   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.\nBreyer also concurred with Thomas' opinion.\n\n   In a vehement dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the court\nfailed to recognize the government's legitimate need to seize money\nin its fight against smugglers and illegal drug traffickers.\nKennedy also mocked the majority in noting that Bajakajian admitted\nto lying to customs officials and would lose only $15,000.\n\n   ``Money launderers will rejoice to know they face forfeitures of\nless than 5 percent of the money transported, provided they hire\naccomplished liars to carry their money for them,'' Kennedy wrote.\nHe was joined in dissent by Chief Justice William H.
