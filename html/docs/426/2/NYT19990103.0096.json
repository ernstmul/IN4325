Most of the other cases came\nfrom police reports about people whose names appeared on a Kansas\nCity police list of 120 money seizures.\n\n   A sampling of the cases:\n\n   - In January 1997, two Minnesota men were driving on Interstate\n35 in North Kansas City when a Missouri Highway Patrol trooper\npulled them over for speeding.\n\n   When the men refused to let the trooper search their car, he\ncalled for a drug-sniffing dog, first from North Kansas City, which\ndid not have a dog, and then from Kansas City police, whose dog was\nunavailable. The Clay County Sheriff's Department provided a dog,\nwhich indicated the possible presence of drugs toward the rear of\nthe car.\n\n   Finally, at least an hour after the stop, officers opened the\ntrunk and found $473,790. When both men said the money did not\nbelong to them, a federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent was\ncalled, according to a Highway Patrol report.\n\n   The DEA took the money, later returning more than $274,000 to\nthe Highway Patrol and more than $94,000 to Clay County. North\nKansas City raised donations to buy a drug dog so it wouldn't be\nunprepared the next time such a windfall occurred.\n\n   - Jason Higgs' pregnant girlfriend left the house after a fight\nin 1994 and called Kansas City police. She told them Higgs kept\ndrugs and a gun in the house.\n\n   Police obtained a search warrant for the house, where they saw\nseveral guns, cash, ``expensive-looking furniture,'' electronic\nequipment and a cornucopia of other items, including cocaine.\nPolice obtained a second search warrant to recover all of it.\n\n   Then they called the DEA.\n\n   ``Given the totality of the above circumstances I contacted the\nDEA to see if they would be interested in seizing the items inside\nthe house,'' Detective Steve Christensen wrote in a report.\n\n   A DEA agent took the $3,925 in cash, a BMW and all the\nelectronic equipment, according to police records. Later the DEA\nreturned more than $10,000 to police.\n\n   Higgs pleaded guilty to drug charges in federal court.\n\n   - Kansas City police arrested David Humphrey in 1992 and seized\nguns, drugs and $21,576 in cash. The drug charges were dropped, and\nHumphrey was convicted on a weapons violation.\n\n   Police held onto the money in a hidden account.\n\n   Soon after Humphrey was released from prison in 1996, he was\ncharged in the wounding of two Kansas City police officers and\nsentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\n   Police asked the DEA to adopt Humphrey's $21,576 from the\nseizure four years before, according to federal court records.\nHumphrey fought the move in federal court, but a judge approved a\nsettlement that gave $16,182 to the DEA, which returned $12,763 of\nit to police. Humphrey kept the rest.\n\n   - A Lafayette County sheriff's deputy stopped Bruce A. Wilson in\n1993 on suspicion of drunken driving. The deputy spotted white\npowder in a vial in Wilson's shoe and arrested him.\n\n   The car was towed to the Odessa Police Department, where a\npolice officer found $13,328. Two months later a cashier's check\nwas sent to the DEA. The DEA didn't complete the process to keep\nthe money, however, until three years later, in 1996, according to\ncourt records. The records do not tell how much the DEA returned to\npolice.\n\n   Wilson was convicted the same year in federal court of drug\ntrafficking.\n\n   - In 1996, Kansas City police searched the home of a restaurant\nowner after a confidential informant reported that the owner was\nselling marijuana, according to court and police records. Police\nseized a couple of plastic bags containing marijuana, $23,000 in\ncash and three cars.\n\n   A few months later, police arrested the owner at his restaurant\nand charged him with two counts of distributing a controlled\nsubstance.
