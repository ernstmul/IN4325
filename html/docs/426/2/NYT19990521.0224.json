The force is\nnow part of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n   Here in the shadows of the Franklin Mountains in West Texas the\npatrol was launched on May 28, 1924. It was also here that a\ncontroversial 1993 stand against illegal immigration _ known as\nOperation Hold the Line _ would become a blue print for modern\noperations from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n   With more than 8,000 agents in green uniforms, the largest law\nenforcement agency on the border has more manpower than ever. The\nincreased number of agents and a budget of more than $3 billion has\npermitted the patrol to make dramatic changes in the Old West\ntactics that made it famous.\n\n   As agents trade their uniforms for tuxedos this week to attend\nbirthday bashes, a fight over the patrol's future is raging in\nWashington.\n\n   The Clinton administration says the patrol has reached its limit\nfor now, and pushing ahead with mass hiring will result in\nlower-quality agents and too many rookies in the field.\n\n   Members of Congress, including Rep. Silvestre Reyes who as a\nBorder Patrol chief in El Paso introduced Hold the Line, contend\nthe administration shirked its responsibility when it recently\nbacked away from a congressional mandate to increase the agency's\nranks by hiring 1,000 new agents per year.\n\n   Lawmakers such as Reyes, D-Texas, want the patrol's strength to\nincrease to 20,000 agents.\n\n   Rugged vehicles and a fleet of $1.3 million high-tech\nhelicopters have all but replaced horses for working the severe\ncountry along the border. Night-vision scopes and underground\nsensors that detect movement have replaced watch towers with bells\nand strings attached to cans.\n\n   The patrol has flexed its new-found muscle to severely limit\nillegal border crossing in El Paso and San Diego and is now\nfocusing its strength in the Rio Grande Valley and near Tucson,\nAriz. Next up is the brushland surrounding Laredo, Del Rio and\nEagle Pass in Texas.\n\n   For the first time, officials believe, they have a shot at\ncontrolling places they long considered a no-man's land.\n\n   ``We have proven with the right support what was once a distant\npossibility is becoming a distinct reality,'' said Gus De La Vina,\nnational chief of the Border Patrol. ``We are making some huge\nstrides.''\n\n   Agents are stationed in 22 states, but most work along the\nMexican border, where 75 percent of the cocaine and marijuana in\nthe United States is believed to enter the country.\n\n   In 1998, agents seized more than 11 tons of cocaine and 435 tons\nof marijuana. That same year, 1.5 million illegal immigrants were\napprehended along the Southwest border.\n\n   The agency's budget of $3 billion today is a far cry from the $1\nmillion with which it started 75 years ago.\n\n   But critics charge the patrol is growing too fast. They say\nagents are trampling on civil rights as towns and cities along the\nborder become zones of occupation.\n\n   ``What these guys are doing is a raw exercise of power,'' Ray\nGil, a lawyer for the San Juan-based South Texas Civil Rights\nProject, has said of the military-like presence that would be\nunheard of away from the border.\n\n   In addition to patrolling in vehicles, agents walk the streets\nand ride bicycles through border cities and towns.\n\n   Traffic heading north is stopped at highway checkpoints where\nagents often use drug-sniffing dogs to search vehicles.\n\n   A 1998 Amnesty International report chastised the patrol over\nallegations of sexual abuse and beatings of those in its custody.\nThe agency promised to investigate the complaints.\n\n   ``Allegations of ill treatment collected include people struck\nwith batons, fists or feet, often as punishment for attempting to\nrun away from Border Patrol agents,'' the report noted.\n\n   A message scrawled in blood-red pen on a cement levee for the\nRio Grande near downtown El Paso warns ``Ojo Migra,'' Spanish slang\nfor ``Watch Out Border Patrol,'' along with a telephone number to\nreport abuse.\n\n   ``A lot of people have considered them a rough law enforcement\nagency, but it is part of their jobs,'' said Pete G. Flores, who is\nwriting a book dedicated to agents who lost their lives on the job.\n\n   ``These people have to be a lot more careful than your average\nlaw enforcement agency,'' Flores said. ``They do not know if they\nare up against people smugglers or dope smugglers who do not think\ntwice about exchanging gunfire.''\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
