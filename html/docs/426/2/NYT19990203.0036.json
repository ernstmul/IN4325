What else\nare you going to name a termite dog? Aluminum Siding? Langford has\nbeen using Woody for about a month to sniff out the wood-eating\nbugs. He says Woody's the only termite dog in Austin.\n\n   ``He's got a nose on him,'' Langford said. ``I'm going to get\nhim his own business cards with his picture on it that says,\n'Woody, termite finder.' ''\n\n   Woody is getting this special treatment because he's already\nhelped Langford land six extermination jobs.\n\n   He'll have to keep up the pace to pay his way, though.\nLangford's company has invested about $12,400 in Woody. Langford\nsays it cost $7,900 to have Woody trained to sniff out termites at\nthe Beacon Academy for dogs in Annapolis, Md. The program lasted 3\n1/2 months.\n\n   Langford also had to buy plane tickets to and from Annapolis for\nhimself and Woody. Langford spent a week at the school to learn how\nto work as Woody's termite-finding handler.\n\n   ``We train the handler to carry out a very thorough house\ninspection,'' said Andrew ``Doc'' Solarz, vice president and\ntrainer at Beacon Dogs Inc. in Annapolis.\n\n   Then there was the $2,400 for a full-page color advertisement in\nthe Austin Yellow Pages to plug his business as the ``HOME OF\nWOODY! Austin's Only Beacon Trained Termite Detection Dog!''\n\n   ``It's called marketing; we've got something no one else has,''\nLangford said. He added that Woody really can find termites,\ncarpenter ants and wood-boring beetles.\n\n   ``He will alert on them by pawing at the wall,'' Langford said.\n``If there's some other kind of bug around, he just passes it by.''\nThat's nice, because you'd hate to tear down a wall for a couple of\nroaches.\n\n   It's all done by smell, Solarz said. A properly trained termite\ndog, he said, can smell the termites that are eating your house\nfrom the inside out. Termites release methane, Langford said.\n\n   Termite dogs ``respond to the odor that's coming out from that\ntermite infestation,'' said Solarz, who has trained 34 dogs to\ndetect termites. ``It's like if you had an onion, and that odor is\ngoing out from that onion.''\n\n   People can't smell termites, because we don't have the amazing\nsniffers that doggies have. ``A dog's olfactory system contains\nsome 200 million olfactory cells,'' Solarz said. ``Man has only\nabout 5 million olfactory cells.''\n\n   Langford ran the dog through his paces at a vacant apartment\nTuesday in Southeast Austin. Langford hid three small plastic\ncontainers with a few termites in each one at various places around\nthe apartment. The dog found all three in short order.\n\n   So what's the advantage of having a dog search for termites\ninstead of looking for them yourself? Langford said it's that the\ndog can tell you they're in the wall before the damage shows up on\nthe outside.\n\n   ``Termites are working inside walls, inside floors; termites\nnever come out into the light,'' Solarz said. ``So a visual\ninspection isn't effective until the termites have done quite a bit\nof damage.''\n\n   ``Short of cutting holes in walls, he can pick up on things that\nyou can't see going on,'' Langford said.\n\n   Besides, it's cuter to watch Woody work than some guy with\nplumber's cleavage.\n\n   Woody has one drawback. Like any dog, he is distracted by\nhigh-priority doggie items such as, say, Fifi.\n\n   ``There would be a reason to abort an inspection with him,''\nLangford said. ``For instance, if they'd had a female dog around in\nheat in the last 30 days.''\n\n   John Kelso writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,\nTexas.
