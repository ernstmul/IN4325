Gurule, 29, had been\noutside the prison walls for more than 60 hours, eluding\nbloodhounds and avoiding detection by the sparsely inhabited woods\nsouth and east of the prison.\n\n   ``We still believe he is inside the perimeter,'' said Johnson,\nreferring to the six-square-mile area that was cordoned off within\nan hour of the escape.\n\n   Martin went over two razor-wire topped fences and fled into the\nwoods shortly after midnight Friday, authorities said. Six other\ndeath row inmates also attempted to flee but surrendered when\nguards fired at them.\n\n   The inmates have been interviewed extensively by investigators,\nJohnson said, and they have not indicated that the escape included\nplans beyond getting outside the walls _ one factor that leads\nauthorities to believe that Gurule has not gone far.\n\n   TDCJ officers have continued to maintain the original perimeter\nand the search was stepped up on Sunday as state troopers began\nstopping and searching cars entering and exiting settlements and\nsubdivisions in the area.\n\n   If Gurule is still in the area, he may try to hide under a\nvehicle, officers said.\n\n   ``At some point, he's going to get tired,'' Johnson said. ``He's\ngoing to get cool at night and hot during the day and he couldn't\nhave had much sleep since Thursday.''\n\n   There have been no reliable sightings of the escapee, Johnson\nsaid, but that could change as residents of the area return home\nfrom holiday trips.\n\n   ``Some of them could discover their house(s) have been broken\ninto or cars were stolen _ things we don't know about now,''\nJohnson said.\n\n   Since the escape, officers have been called to three residences\nin the area, but none produced a lead, they said.\n\n   A house was broken into but the only missing items were a pillow\ncase and some silverware, authorities said. In another, a mobile\nhome was believed to have been burglarized but nothing was taken,\nthey added.\n\n   On Saturday night, a resident of Riverside reported that he had\nfound an intruder _ matching Gurule's description _ under his house\nand fired several shots at him with a semiautomatic pistol,\nauthorities said.\n\n   Dogs picked up a scent, and officers said they found no spent\ncasings. Shortly before midnight, they withdrew from the location\nand there was speculation it was a ``crackpot call.''\n\n   Johnson said that he was disappointed but not surprised by the\nabsence of sightings. Escapees often find a place to ``lie down''\nand try to wait out a search, he added.\n\n   Like others involved in the manhunt, Johnson said he is counting\non the elements and the terrain to force Gurule's surrender.\n\n   ``Sleep deprivation is a big thing,'' Johnson said. ``He\n(Gurule) couldn't be getting any sleep out there. We've had three\nhelicopters providing air cover. We've had dog teams out there\nevery two or three hours.\n\n   ``When you hear dogs yelping, you don't know where they are\ngoing or where they are coming from.''\n\n   Gurule, 29, was awaiting execution for the 1992 slaying of two\nmen during a restaurant robbery in Corpus Christi.\n\n   Authorities said he and the other six death row inmates cut a\nsmall hole in a recreation yard fence, made their way to the roof\nof their cell block and hid there for three hours before\napproaching the fences.\n\n   Officials said prison guards fired at least 18 shots at them.\nWhile the others dropped to the ground and surrendered, Gurule\nscaled the two outside fences using clothing or a blanket to help\nprotect him from the razor wire, authorities said.\n\n   They said that blood on the wire indicated that Gurule may have\nbeen injured.\n\n   Investigators said that they believe that the hole in the\nrecreation yard's fence was cut with a hacksaw, which has not been\nfound.\n\n   ``It might have just been a hacksaw blade,'' TDCJ spokesman Glen\nCastleberry said. ``It might have been just a small piece of a\nhacksaw blade.''\n\n   The manhunt has involved an estimated 500 law-enforcement\nofficers but Johnson said they are not beating the bushes on foot.\n\n   ``That would contaminate the area,'' he said.
