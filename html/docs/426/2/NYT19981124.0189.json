{"DocumentId":"NYT19981124.0189","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-BABE-FILM-REVIEW-NYT \n`BABE, PIG IN THE CITY': GOODBYE GREEN ACRES, HELLO WILD SIDE \n\n   (Production notes at end)  \n(JT) \n By JANET MASLIN   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout,\nspends his second film in considerably more daunting surroundings\nthan those of the Hoggetts (James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski) and\ntheir farm. In ``Babe: Pig in the City'' his new friends include\nchimps and a pit bull, signaling the obviously less lighthearted\nquality of this sequel.\n\n   As directed once again by George Miller, Babe remains a cute\nlittle porker, but his fanciful new backdrops are less beguiling.\nDespite his mandate (from his dog mother, with the voice of Miriam\nMargolyes) to demonstrate ``how a kind and steady heart can mend a\nsorry world,'' Babe must contend here with many discouraging urban\nwoes. Chief among them is Mickey Rooney as a dissipated circus\nclown, possibly cast here to show how much more refreshing Babe is\nthan many human beings.\n\n   This film's occasional taste for dark moments and unappetizing\nsights makes its G rating somewhat questionable for very young\nchildren. The plot contrives to send Farmer Hoggett down a well in\na nasty accident. Then Babe and Esme Hoggett head for the city,\nhoping to save the farm. Much fun is made of Ms. Szubanski's sturdy\nEsme, who becomes the subject of endless fat jokes as well as a\npolice strip-search at the airport. It seems that a drug-sniffing\ndog has detected contraband somewhere, and anyone eager to explain\nthat to tots should have no problem with the rest of the story. It\nbrings Babe and Esme to a fleabag _ the Flealands Hotel _ where\nanimals are officially outlawed but actually welcome.\n\n   Here, at this menagerie-filled version of the Chelsea, Babe\nfinds the kind of urban demimonde he never saw on the farm. There\nis an orangutan named Thelonius (get it?) and a family of\nworld-weary chimps (with Steven Wright providing the wise-guy\nfather's voice, and Glenne Headly as the pregnant, floozyish\nmother). Continuing his walk on the wild side, Babe also meets a\npink poodle with Blanche DuBois tendencies and squads of cats and\ndogs who behave like members of rival gangs. Sheepherding contests,\nanyone? There's plenty to be said about the urban troubles seen\nhere, but it's not best heard out of the mouth of Babe.\n\n   This visually ambitious film does concoct an elaborate\npan-metropolis including traces of New York, Hollywood, San\nFrancisco, Paris, Venice and so on. And the Flealands Hotel becomes\nan enveloping setting, even if its gloom spoils some of the fun.\nThere's some good news in the fact that Babe's mouse friends come\nalong for the journey, and that their musical tastes (``Non, Je Ne\nRegrette Rien,'' ``That's Amore,'' ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'')\nremain as adorably eclectic as ever. The cats who greet them with a\nchorus of ``Three Blind Mice'' are also a nice touch.\n\n   But by the time Esme has wound up in the clown's purple suit and\nis swinging from a chandelier across a ballroom, this ``Babe'' has\nall but lost its bearings.\n\n   It will work as a sequel only hard-core ``Babe'' fans willing to\nfollow this four-legged hero (or heroine, as Babe obviously is in\nsome scenes) anywhere. Had ``Pig in the City'' been made first, it\nby no means could have prompted a sequel of its own.\n\n   PRODUCTION NOTES\n\n   BABE, Pig in the City\n\n   Directed by George Miller; written by Miller, Judy Morris and\nMark Lamprell; director of photography, Andrew Lesnie; edited by\nJay Friedkin and Margaret Sixel; music by Nigel Westlake;\nproduction designer, Roger Ford; produced by Miller, Doug Mitchell\nand Bill Miller; released by Universal Pictures.
