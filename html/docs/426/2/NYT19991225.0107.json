Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ Against a backdrop of almost daily government\nwarnings about potential terrorist acts around the country, the\nauthorities are readying an elaborate plan to keep Times Square's\nmillennial celebration safe.\n\n   Eight thousand police officers _ a force larger than most\nmunicipal police departments around the country _ will be assigned\nto an area around Times Square about half the size of Central Park.\nThe police plan to tow every car parked on the streets anywhere\nwithin the mile-long, three-block-wide strip of Midtown, both to\nclear the way for throngs of revelers and to thwart a possible car\nbombing in the area, which will be closed to traffic.\n\n   Consolidated Edison and Bell Atlantic have welded manhole covers\nshut, and the Sanitation Department will remove garbage cans from\nevery street corner in the so-called frozen zone around Times\nSquare.\n\n   The authorities also are locking mailboxes in the area.\n\n   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, appearing confident that the\nelaborate preparations and the huge deployment of uniformed and\nplainclothes officers will keep the New Year's celebration safe,\nhave sought to reassure New Yorkers despite the escalating series\nof warnings about possible millennial terrorist attacks.\n\n   Since the arrest in Washington State two weeks ago of an\nAlgerian charged with possessing bomb materials, and the arrest\nthis week in Vermont of a couple the authorities say have ties to\nterrorists, federal agencies have increased airport and border\nsecurity and issued alerts about travel and possible mail bomb\nattacks.\n\n   Safir has emphasized that there is no specific intelligence\ninformation suggesting that terrorists are planning to strike in\nTimes Square or any other locations or events in New York City.\n\n   ``There are no guarantees, but we can take every precaution\nthat's humanly possible, and that's what we're going to do,'' Safir\nsaid. ``I think the public should come to Times Square, and I think\nthey should not be deterred by all of this terrorist hype that is\ngoing on.''\n\n   In an interview, Safir described what he said was a painstaking\nplan for Times Square this New Year's Eve, three years in the\nmaking. It covers everything from keeping the Police Department's\nsix helicopters aloft for surveillance to extra training for\nofficers in the street to identify suspicious people as they file\nthrough tightly controlled channels allowing access to Times\nSquare.\n\n   Officers also have been trained to watch carefully for revelers\nbringing alcohol into the area, as part of the Giuliani\nadministration's strict enforcement of the open-container law.\n\n   Safir said about 7,000 uniformed officers will be in the area,\noverseen by nearly 700 supervisors, while about 300 plainclothes\nofficers mix with the revelers. Special surveillance teams with\nbomb-sniffing dogs also will check the crowd.\n\n   But at the same time, the Police Department and other law\nenforcement agencies are working to track and monitor potential\nterror suspects in the New York area and prepare for the worst case\nscenario, a large-scale assault somewhere in the city.\n\n   These measures, seldom discussed and often cloaked in secrecy,\nare the outgrowth of concerns that a terrorist attack could occur,\nrather than of suspicions or specific information about a\nparticular threat, city and law enforcement officials said. The\nconcerns are rooted in the knowledge among senior law enforcement\nofficials that, as one put it, ``There are people out there who\nhate us, who want to destroy us and have proven they have the means\nto hurt us.''\n\n   FBI agents and police detectives assigned to the Joint Terrorist\nTask Force have been reviewing reports of interviews with\nconfidential informants and intercepted communications looking for\nclues that could have been missed, clues that may point to possible\nplanned terrorist actions, according to several law enforcement\nsources. The task force, which includes over 100 agents, detectives\nand other federal agents, also are keeping close surveillance on a\nnumber of suspected terrorists in the New York area.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   A Police Department plan, code-named Archangel, also will be in\neffect on New Year's Eve, the sources said. The plan puts the\ndepartment on its highest alert possible and includes detailed\nmethods for responding to and investigating terrorist acts,\nincluding biological or chemical assaults, the sources said. Safir\nwould not discuss the plan.\n\n   The city's five district attorneys also have a plan to operate\nin the event of a massive power outage or terrorist attack,\naccording to city and law enforcement officials. People arrested in\nManhattan and Staten Island, would be arraigned in Brooklyn, where\none of the borough's courthouses can be powered by a generator, and\nBronx suspects would be taken to Queens, where there is a\ncourthouse with its own limited power source, officials said.\n\n   Prosecutors have been stockpiling pens, legal pads and copies of\nthe criminal procedure law _ now usually read on computer terminals\n_ to write up complaints by hand, officials said. Prosecutors'\noffices have either purchased new carbon-copy complaint forms or\ndug out boxes of the old forms that had been used before operations\nwere computerized, the officials said. Bottled water and other\nsupplies have also been stockpiled so the offices can operate\nwithout interruption.\n\n   Safir said the Police Department has made similar plans to\noperate without power, stockpiling supplies, including more than\ntwo dozen typewriters, military rations and magnesium lights.\n\n   But the visible preparations will begin in the days before Dec.\n31, as No Parking signs in the Times Square area go up, warning\nmotorists that come early Friday morning, cars parked there will be\ntowed.\n\n   Then, shortly after 12:01 a.m. on the 31st, police will halt the\nflow of traffic into the frozen zone around Times Square, from West\n43rd to West 47th Streets and along Broadway and 7th Avenue,\nofficials said. They will expand the area, and tow any remaining\ncars, up to West 59th Street, down to West 35th and east to Sixth\nAvenue and west to Eighth Avenue during the afternoon as the crowd\ngrows.\n\n   In that area, the police will set up emergency lanes down the\nmiddle of each street so that in the event of an emergency,\nambulances and fire trucks can move through the crowds.\n","Headline":"\nSECURITY PLAN   FOR TIMES SQ.
