The escapee, who\nscrambled up a tree as officers closed in, was asked to come down\nand give himself up, which he did, Fitzgerald said.\n\n   Jones, at first thought to be hiding out in the woods naked, was\nwearing his white prison-issue boxer shorts when he was captured.\nHe appeared to be suffering from dehydration and mosquito bites,\nand asked for food and water, which he was given when he was\nreturned to the prison, Fitzgerald said.\n\n   ``Considering where's he's been, he's in good condition,''\nFitzgerald said. ``He wasn't a walking welt,'' he added, referring\nto earlier indications that the inmate had climbed a poison\nivy-infested oak tree Sunday night.\n\n   Jones, 33, was serving a 26-year sentence _ 20 years for killing\na Dallas man and attempting to kill a police officer, and six for\nassaulting a prison guard. He now faces charges for escape and will\nbe transferred to another prison unit for medical treatment,\nFitzgerald said.\n\n   Allan Polunsky, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice,\nmeanwhile, ordered an internal investigation of Jones' escape from\nthe 2-year-old prison, which was built as a prototype for prisons\nhousing some of the state's most dangerous offenders. Already,\nprison officials have modified plans for four more prisons under\nconstruction to take into account flaws that allowed Jones to\nescape.  \n\n     On Sunday, as Jones was being led from his cell to a caged\nrecreation area, he slipped out of his handcuffs and shoved a guard\nout of the way before climbing a 25-foot fence and squeezing\nthrough an 8- to 10-inch gap between the top of the fence and the\nroof.\n\n   After scaling a second fence and a camera tower, he vaulted over\nthe razor wire atop the prison's outer fence. A perimeter guard in\na van fired two shots at Jones, but missed.\n\n   Security cameras recorded Jones shedding his shoes and stripping\noff his prison uniform about 100 yards from the prison before\nrunning into the woods. Search dogs followed Jones' trail to an oak\ntree covered in poison ivy vines, where officials believe the\nkiller spent the night.\n\n   On Sunday and Monday, as crews worked to shore up security at\nEstelle, welding additional fencing to fill the gap through which\nJones escaped and adding razor wire to the camera towers, about 300\nsearchers used dogs, boats and helicopters to hunt for Jones.\n\n   They had few leads until about 3 a.m. Tuesday, when a helicopter\nequipped with heat sensors detected the prisoner in chest-deep\nwater near the prison. The helicopter was running low on fuel and\nwasn't able to land because of the wooded and swampy terrain,\nofficials said.\n\n   ``Once the helicopter spotted him, we redoubled our efforts in\nthat area and were closing in when a guard saw him,'' Fitzgerald\nsaid. ``He was found in the area where we were searching all the\ntime.''\n\n   Jones was the first inmate to escape from a Texas prison this\nyear. Last Thanksgiving, seven condemned killers escaped death row\nat the nearby Ellis I unit. One of them, Martin Gurule, cleared the\nprison's outer fences, but was found dead in a creek near the\nprison after a massive weeklong manhunt. An autopsy showed that he\nhad drowned shortly after his escape.\n\n   Prison board member Mac Stringfellow of San Antonio, who will\nlead the investigation into Jones' escape, also investigated\nGurule's break-out. In that case, investigators concluded that\nnegligence by prison employees was to blame.
