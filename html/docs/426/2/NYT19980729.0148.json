DOWDY  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   BOSTON _ Massachusetts State Police thought they had sniffed out\na big-time drug trafficker when Manuel Espinola of Tewksbury put\nhis bag through an airport X-ray machine.\n\n   There, buried in his luggage, was a bundle of cash totaling\n$14,665.\n\n   When police questioned him, Espinola became nervous, saying he\nwas flying to Las Vegas to buy a house. Yet he couldn't give police\nhis broker's name or employer's telephone number.\n\n   Then, a specially-trained dog detected cocaine on the money.\n\n   Espinola was not arrested at the airport during the incident in\nNovember 1996 because police lacked enough evidence to build a case\nagainst him as a trafficker. But State Trooper Stephen G. Lynch\nseized the money under federal drug forfeiture laws, which allows\nconfiscation of property thought to be gained from or used in drug\ndeals.\n\n   The government has had the money ever since.\n\n   But on July 2, US District Court Judge Nancy Gertner ordered the\nmoney returned to Espinola and delivered a blistering critique of\npolice, saying they may have relied on ``blatant ethnic\nstereotyping.''\n\n   African-American and Latino civil rights groups say\n``profiling,'' the process by which drug agents and police decide\nwho to stop and search in airports and along highways, has resulted\nin unfair use of race and the disproportionate stopping of black\nand Latino travelers nationwide.\n\n   During the last decade, the Supreme Court and lower federal\ncourts have granted police wide latitude to size up suspects as\npart of the ``war on drugs.''\n\n   But Gertner, in one of the first major blows against profiling,\nsaid police violated Espinola's rights.\n\n   ``The government's showing of probable cause is completely\ninadequate,'' Gertner wrote, ``based on a troubling mix of baseless\ngeneralizations, leaps of logic or worse, blatant ethnic\nstereotyping.''\n\n   To Gregory Nojeim, general legislative counsel for the American\nCivil Liberties Union, the case ``signals to law enforcement that\npassengers are not to be treated as if they are criminals unless\nthere is probable cause of crime.\n\n   ``In the airport, passengers check their luggage, not their\nrights to privacy.''\n\n   George Festa,      special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration in New England, said law enforcement would continue\nits aggressive patrol of airports. He said such efforts have cut\ndown on drug trafficking at Logan.\n\n   ``I'm not happy with this decision because the officer did what\nhe is paid to do,'' he said. ``No one stood back and said, `That\nman looks like a criminal! Let's stop him.' The trooper went step\nby step to build probable cause. We weren't satisfied with\nEspinola's responses.''\n\n   Espinola, a salesman for Equinox International, an Amway-like\nconsumer products company, has declined comment, saying he feared\nretaliation from the government. His lawyer, Blaine DeFreitas,\nsaid, ``Just because a young Hispanic male carries a large amount\nof money doesn't mean that money was ill-gotten.''\n\n   Gertner made her ruling in the midst of a national controversy\non profiling, or what some have dubbed ``DWBs _ Driving While\nBlack.''\n\n   Strip searches at customs at Chicago's O'Hare International\nAirport have led to a federal lawsuit by 18 African-American women.\nLast week, US Senators Dick Durbin and Carol Moseley-Braun, both\nDemocrats of Illinois, released data showing black women are the\nmost singled out group for strip searches.\n\n   In addition, the ACLU says it has received hundreds of\ncomplaints regarding computerized airport screenings from travelers\nto the Middle East, travelers who have Arab names, and\nAfrican-Americans.\n\n   ``Profiling is lazy law enforcement,'' Nojeim said.\n\n   The Justice Department is investigating possible civil rights\nviolations in traffic stops and the House recently passed a bill to\nmonitor stops. The bill has stalled in the Senate under lobbying by\npolice associations.\n\n   Last week, the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People announced it would begin studying traffic stops made\nby police. In an interview with the Globe this week, NAACP Chairman\nJulian Bond said he was approached a few months ago at a turnpike\nrest stop between Washington and Philadelphia by a state trooper.\nBond said the trooper's hand was on his revolver.\n\n   ``The trooper said, `You resemble a suspect in a robbery,' said\nBond, who said he felt ``enormous fear'' at that moment. ``The\ntrooper looked back at the woman who was with him and asked her if\nI looked like the robber.\n\n   ``The woman said, `I told you it was a kid.'''\n\n   Bond is 58 years old.\n\n   In recent years, authorities have stopped and interrogated\nprominent African-Americans and Latinos such as Harvard Law School\nprofessor Charles Ogletree, former Virginia governor Douglas\nWilder, Texas appeals court Justice Linda Reyna Yanez, and baseball\nHall of Famer Joe Morgan.\n\n   Air travelers who have been stopped report everything from\nhaving underwear put on display to missed flights and assault.\nWilder was grabbed by the throat by a security guard at the\nRaleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina in 1995. Morgan was\nawarded $796,000 by the city of Los Angeles after being thrown to\nthe floor and handcuffed at the Los Angeles Airport in 1988.\n\n   Ogletree said he has been stopped about 12 times since 1980,\nwhile dressed casually and when wearing a suit, at airports in\nBoston, Miami, New York, Newark, and Baltimore.\n\n   ``When I came back from Jamaica, the only thing consistent was\nthat all of the people being stopped had dark skin,'' Ogletree\nsaid. ``It is a situation of terror. You're so vulnerable. When\nagents start searching and bring the dogs to sniff your bags you\nhave no recourse.\n\n   ``It's the embarrassment of having fellow travelers all around\nyou who don't know you thinking you are guilty. You go away and the\nfirst thing that happens when you come home is that you are\nreminded of your status in this society.\n\n   Judge Reyna Yanez and her teenage daughter, Amparo, were walking\nthrough an airport in Harlingen, Texas, in 1995 when a border\npatrol agent grabbed her daughter, suspecting her of being in the\ncountry illegally.\n\n   ``They tried to intimidate me,'' said Reyna Yanez in a telephone\ninterview. ``I knew that my daughter and I were being singled out\nfor an immutable trait, our race, so it made me remember when I was\na little girl in school where they used to punish us for speaking\nSpanish.''\n\n   Amparo Yanez, now 21, said she could hardly hold back her tears.\nShe said she has been stopped at least three times.\n\n   ``I was tired and harassed and completely terrified,'' Amparo\nsaid, also on the phone. ``I was embarrassed and scared and I felt\ndiscriminated against because of my skin color.''\n\n   In the Espinola case, Gertner originally granted police a\nwarrant to seize the money based on an affidavit Lynch submitted\nafter the incident. In her 30-page decision, she said she was wrong\nto have done so, saying she was misled by the affidavit and did not\nhave a chance to hear Espinola's side.\n\n   She dismissed the fact that Espinola's cash contained traces of\ncocaine, citing several studies that show that 90 percent of all US\ncurrency is tinged with the drug.\n\n   US Attorney Donald K.
