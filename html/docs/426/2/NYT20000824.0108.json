And it's good news for Fido, because the discovery could\nlead to mechanical sniffer dogs replacing the real thing for\ndangerous tasks such as detecting land mines.\n\n   Gary Settles, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University in\nUniversity Park, says the military asked him and his colleagues to\ninvestigate the sniffing powers of man's best friend. The Defense\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency was working on land mine\ndetection, says Settles, ''and asked if we could understand how a\ndog can do what it does so well''.\n\n   To find out, Settles took pictures of dogs smelling various\nscents. As dogs breathe, they draw in cooler air, which is then\nwarmed by their bodies and exhaled. Using a technique called\nSchlieren photography, which records how gases of different\ntemperatures refract light, the researchers obtained images showing\nthe air currents produced by the noses of the sniffing dogs.\n\n   They found that a dog's astounding olfactory success comes\npartly from its ability to divert exhaled air away from a target\nscent. When a dog exhales, it moves its nose so that the air is\ndeflected through slits on the side. As a result, the exhaled air\nflows backward, away from the smell. This prevents the scent being\nconfused with exhaled air, and sets up a current that pulls new air\nacross the target, launching odor molecules into the air. When dogs\ninhale they shift their noses into an entirely different shape to\ndraw in a large volume of air. Settles is submitting the results to\nThe Journal of Experimental Biology.\n\n   ''Their work has helped motivate ours,'' says Joel White, a\nneuroscientist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. White is part\nof a team working with the Penn State researchers to develop an\nartificial nose that is just as good at detecting land mines as\ncanine sniffers.\n\n   White says Settles' results are helping them redesign their\ndevice, so that it mimics the way a dog samples air. The machine\n''breathes'' air in and out, instead of drawing it straight\nthrough. Because its sensors remove most of the odor molecules from\nthe air it draws in, the machine can use the exhaled air as a\nbaseline. The contrast between this baseline and the inflowing air\nis what allows the system to detect a particular smell.\n\n   White says his group's artificial nose has successfully detected\nmines in a test field. Now he is working on improving it _ and it\nstill has some catching up to do, as its canine competitor is\nbetween 10 and 50 times more sensitive.   \n\n     (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.)     \n","Headline":"\nLAND MINE SNIFFER TO WORK LIKE A DOG  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF AUGUST 24, 2000)\n","Text":["\n   The secrets of a dog's extraordinary sense of smell have been\nunlocked.
