Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether a\nSouth Carolina public hospital conducted unconstitutional searches\nwhen it tested pregnant women's urine for drugs so it could report\nillegal drug use to the police.\n\n   The case is an appeal on behalf of 10 women who sued after being\narrested as a result of the policy, some while they were still weak\nand bleeding from childbirth. It presents the Supreme Court a\nnarrow but important aspect of a legal and public policy debate\nthat began in the peak years of the crack epidemic of the 1980s:\nthe extent to which a state may intervene to protect fetal health\nand the circumstances under which pregnant women may be held\ncriminally responsible for behavior that endangers their fetuses.\n\n   A federal appeals court ruled last year that while the\nurinanalysis was a search, it was not unconstitutional because it\nwas justified by ``a special need beyond normal law-enforcement\ngoals,'' namely protecting the health and safety of fetuses and\nnewborn babies.\n\n   In their appeal, lawyers for the women are arguing that this\nconclusion amounts to a drastic expansion of what the Supreme Court\nhas previously treated as a ``special-needs exception'' to the\nFourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.\n\n   ``Nearly every application of the criminal law serves some\nhealth or safety purpose'' and so could be placed outside the\nprotection of the Fourth Amendment under this approach, the women's\nbrief said. The appeal is supported by a coalition of public health\ngroups, which told the justices that women who need prenatal care\nthe most will be deterred from seeking it if their drug abuse is\ntreated not as a medical problem but as a criminal one.\n\n   None of the women who filed the lawsuit were actually\nprosecuted, and the particular program they are challenging ended\nin the mid-1990s, after suits were filed and the U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services began an investigation.\n\n   However, Lynn Paltrow, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers and\ndirector of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, a program of the\nWomen's Law Project in Philadelphia, said Monday that drug testing\nof pregnant women remained widespread in South Carolina under the\nstate Supreme Court's interpretation of the state child\nendangerment law as applying not only to children but also to\nviable fetuses. The U.S. Supreme Court refused two years ago to\nreview that state court interpretation.\n\n   ``No other state has gone as far as South Carolina,'' Paltrow\nsaid in an interview, adding: ``No other state has made it a crime\nto be pregnant and addicted. These women had a health problem and\nneeded medical care, but they were taken to jail.''\n\n   The lead plaintiff in the case, Crystal M. Ferguson, tested\npositive for cocaine during a prenatal visit to the hospital at the\nMedical University of South Carolina, in Charleston, in June 1991.\nShe agreed to attend a drug abuse counseling program, but tested\npositive again when she gave birth in August. She was arrested\nthree days later. According to the city's statistics, 30 women were\narrested under the program. Charges against all but two were\ndropped when the women entered treatment. Some of the women were\ntaken from their hospital rooms in handcuffs or leg shackles. The\nplaintiffs are seeking damages and an injunction against future\ndrug testing.\n\n   Analytically, the case is quite similar to another Fourth\nAmendment case the Supreme Court accepted for review last week, on\nwhether police checkpoints that subject motorists to drug-detecting\ndogs are constitutional. The lower court in that case, Indianapolis\nvs. Edmond, rejected the government's argument that the need to\ndetect and deter drug trafficking was a ``special need'' that\njustified the warrantless searches.\n\n   In the new case, Ferguson v. City of Charleston, No. 99-936, the\ncity asserts that the hospital adopted its policy, in cooperation\nwith the police and local prosecutor's office, in 1989 in the face\nof ``an epidemic of cocaine use'' among its maternity patients.\n\n   ``The clinical necessity for the drug screens, the health\nproblems associated with maternal cocaine use, and the astronomical\neconomic costs of caring for infants suffering from the effects of\ncocaine use by their mothers all created special needs beyond\nnormal law enforcement goals,'' the city maintains. That was the\nanalysis endorsed in a 2-1 decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court\nof Appeals, in Richmond, Va., which affirmed a jury's verdict in\nfavor of the hospital.\n\n   The hospital did not test all its patients, instead singling out\nthose it regarded as most likely to be using drugs. The criteria\nincluded having received no prenatal care or care that was late or\nincomplete; displaying certain physical symptoms; unexplained\npreterm labor; and known drug or alcohol abuse in the past. Many of\nthe public hospital's patients are poor and black; of the 10\nplaintiffs, nine are black and one is white.\n\n   As the crack epidemic hit its peak, states adopted varying\napproaches to the issue of drug use by pregnant women. Because a\nnumber of state courts ruled, unlike the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt, that a fetus could not be considered a child for purposes of\nprosecuting pregnant women under child abuse laws, some prosecutors\nargued that mothers delivered illegal drugs to their newborn babies\nthrough the umbilical cord during the brief moments between birth\nand the cutting of the cord.\n\n   A woman was convicted in Florida under this theory in 1989, but\nthe Florida Supreme Court overturned the conviction three years\nlater, ruling unanimously that when the state Legislature made\n``delivery'' of illegal drugs a crime, it did not contemplate a\nprosecution of this sort.\n","Headline":"\nSUPREME COURT TO CONSIDER LEGALITY OF TESTING PREGNANT WOMEN FOR\nDRUGS\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether a\nSouth Carolina public hospital conducted unconstitutional searches\nwhen it tested pregnant women's urine for drugs so it could report\nillegal drug use to the police.\n","\n   The case is an appeal on behalf of 10 women who sued after being\narrested as a result of the policy, some while they were still weak\nand bleeding from childbirth.
