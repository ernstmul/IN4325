She\nis trying to finish a novel)\n\n     By DAHLIA LITHWICK      \n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)     \n\n   Here's a tip for everyone involved in transporting illegal drugs\nover interstate lines: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says\nbuy hard luggage.\n\n   It's all in the context of things state agents can and cannot do\nto you under the Fourth Amendment prohibition against\n``unreasonable searches and seizures.''\n\n   The current jurisprudence of criminal procedure holds that a\npolice/border patrol/FBI agent may:\n\n   _Conduct a search of your home, body, or personal effects if\nthey have a warrant.\n\n   _Conduct a frisk or ``pat-down'' of your body without your\nconsent or a warrant if you have given them ``reasonable\nsuspicion'' to do so.\n\n   _Peek into your open windows and/or root through your garbage\ncans without your consent or a warrant.\n\n   _Detain you at the border but only to question you or check\ncitizenship status.\n\n   _Fly over your backyard in their big, black ``X-Files''\nhelicopters looking for your hash crop without consent or a\nwarrant.\n\n   _Give your luggage to Cheech the drug-sniffing dog without\nconsent or a warrant.\n\n   The things police cannot do to you and your bags, absent your\nconsent or a warrant, are measured against your ``reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.''\n\n   Tuesday's case before the Supreme Court, Bond vs. United States,\nwas about whether you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when\nyou place your drugs in the overhead compartment of a Greyhound\nbus.\n\n   Stephen Dewayne Bond and his drugs left California on a bus\ntraveling to Arkansas at approximately 65 miles an hour. Bond had a\n``brick'' of methamphetamine in a soft bag he stowed in the\noverhead compartment. The bus was pulled over in Texas and border\npatrol agent Cesar Cantu boarded the bus for a routine immigration\ninspection.\n\n   As you know from the handy guide above, Cantu's behavior was\nlimited to asking questions and checking documents. But once he did\nso, Cantu made his way back to the front of the bus, squeezing and\nfeeling the luggage in the overhead compartments.\n\n   Cantu felt Bond's brick and grew suspicious, Bond consented to a\nsearch, drugs were found, and Bond confessed.\n\n   Bond tried to suppress the drugs (and resulting confession) on\nthe grounds that Cantu's fondling of his bag violated his Fourth\nAmendment guarantee against unreasonable searches. Both the\ndistrict court and the Fifth Circuit disagreed, and Bond got 57\nmonths in prison.\n\n   The question before the Supreme Court Tuesday was whether public\nbag-squeezing by state officials constitutes a search under the\nFourth Amendment.\n\n   The court must locate this case within a continuum of existing\ncase law by deciding whether Cantu's act was closer to permissible\ngarbage-rooting or impermissible frisking. And that will turn on\nthe rather mushy notion of what we consider ``private'' when we\ntake our bodies and our stuff out for walks in public spaces.\n\n   Bond's attorney, Carolyn Fuentes, tries to analogize the Bond\nfacts to a frisk. She says we expect people to move our luggage on\noverhead racks, but we have no expectation they will squeeze and\nfeel it, just as we don't expect strangers to squeeze and feel us\n(unless we're in Paris).\n\n   But Justice Scalia is itching to put forth his ``reasonable\nexpectation of privacy'' theory, and it's this: We don't expect\nreasonable, polite people to squeeze our overhead bags any more\nthan we expect reasonable, polite people to peep in our windows.\n\n   But, he continues, the privacy standard isn't limited to our\nexpectations of nice people. He hypothesizes ``nasty passengers''\nwho joyfully squeeze strangers' bags. Why have an expectation of\nprivacy that excludes them?\n\n   (Scalia returns to this theme several times and it puzzles me\ndoes he really believe the world to be so teeming with nasty\nbag-squeezers that they create a reasonable social expectation that\nit happens?)\n\n   Justice Stephen Breyer, inspired perhaps by Bond's unsolicited\nconfession to Cantu, almost immediately confesses that he\nfrequently flies to Boston and pushes other people's bags around\nthe overhead bins in order to shove his own in. He asks how one can\nexpect privacy in those bags if everyone is moving them.\n\n   To prove that irony is alive and thriving in the Supreme Court,\nBond asserts that Cantu's search was excessive because his drugs\nwere so well disguised _ the brick was wrapped in duct tape until\nthe package was oval. Then wrapped in a pair of pants. Then packed\nin a canvas bag.\n\n   Cantu's search had to have been wildly intrusive to discern the\nbrick under all that illegal concealment of an illegal substance.\nFuentes gets impressively aggrieved on his behalf.\n\n   Scalia tells her flat out that if she's asking for a test based\non ``degree of manipulation,'' he's unlikely to go along. Kennedy\nis bothered because the case law says the subjective purpose of the\nsearcher is irrelevant, yet Fuentes' test seems to require it. She\nreplies that the case is not about the ``motive'' of the squeezer\nbut the ``manner.''\n\n   In other words, we may reasonably expect strangers to move our\nbags for any number of reasons but not to ``squeeze and shake''\nthem, as Cantu did. Put another way, Bond's contention is that bags\nshould only be stirred, not shaken.\n\n   It's at this point that Scalia interrupts to tell Fuentes that\nhe'd ``feel a lot sorrier for your client if there weren't an easy\nway to avoid this. It's called hard luggage.''\n\n   Justice Anthony Kennedy is hung up on the fact that Bond never\nasked Cantu to stop searching his bag and is unimpressed when\nFuentes suggests border guards tend to have a rather intimidating\nair of authority. Kennedy asks how you can have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy if you refuse to avail yourself of the power\nto protect it.\n\n   Scalia cuts in to ask whether fellow passengers have the right\nto sniff your luggage.\n\n   Jeffrey A. Lamken represents the solicitor general's office, and\nhe reels off long, long sentences, frequently without breathing. He\nalmost immediately gets tangled up in a colloquy with Kennedy over\nwhether Bond might have some civil tort remedies against\nbag-squeezers. He says Bond has suffered no harm. Kennedy tells him\nBond's attorney will probably beg to differ since her client is in\njail.\n\n   A gloriously funny moment arrives when Scalia asks: Suppose\nidentifying the item in the bag would have required pulling and\nsqueezing beyond foreseeable pulling or grabbing by other\npassengers? Since honesty is a virtue, Lamken replies, ``Then we\nwould lose.'' To which Scalia rejoins, ``Then you may lose.''\n\n   Judge David Souter tries to press him on the difference between\n``touching and looking'' for Fourth Amendment purposes. We\nreasonably expect strangers to look at us or our stuff. We do not\nexpect them to touch us.\n\n   Kennedy wonders if the issue is the length of time the officer\ntakes to manipulate the bag. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asks him\nto read something from the record, and Lamken scrambles to find it,\nemitting a sigh so loud it almost wakes Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\n   Breyer warns (echoing Scalia's earlier point) that it would be\n``a mistake to generate a jurisprudence of hard squeezes.'' Unless\nthis is Charmin Court.\n\n   Justice John Paul Stevens reels off a list of hypotheticals that\nleave Lamken breathless: What if Bond kept his bag in his lap\n(can't touch); what if he kept it under the seat (also can't\ntouch); well what if he was sharing the space under the seat (still\ncan't)? What, Stevens asks, about that shared compartment\nunderneath the bus?\n\n   ``I'm not understanding the situation you're describing,''\nreplies Lamken.\n\n   ``You never ride on buses? Only airplanes?'' asks Stevens.\nLamken replies that this compartment can presumably be searched if\nother passengers touch the bags.\n\n   Scalia: ``How about if only the driver can touch the bags? If he\ntakes them out, one by one. 'Jones! Jones!' This is a slow bus.''\nLamken looks like he's been beaten to within an inch of his life\nwith blunt hypotheticals.\n\n   Wherever the court draws the line between ``good touch'' and\n``bad touch'' today, one pragmatic point is clear: If you ever have\nto pick which justice to sit beside on a plane, go with Ginsburg.\nBreyer is a self-confessed luggage-mover, and Scalia may well be a\ncloset luggage-sniffer.\n\n   -------\n\n   Visit Slate on the Web at: http://www.slate.com\n\n   Copyright 2000 Slate\n\n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)\n","Headline":"\nSUPREME COURT GUIDE TO DRUG-SMUGGLING AND BAG-SQUEEZING \n","Text":["\n   (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York\nTimes Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA\nWEYDERT at 732-390-4480)\n","\n   (Dahlia Lithwick covers the Supreme Court for Slate.
