{"DocumentId":"NYT19980619.0387","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-BORDER-OVERLOAD-HNS \nRECORD NUMBER OF CRIMINAL CASES ON BORDER \n\n\n  \n (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK \n1998c. Houston Chronicle \n\n   The federal justice system along the U.S.-Mexico border is\nexperiencing record criminal caseloads, with drug and immigration\noffenders clogging courts and crowding prisons.\n\n   From San Diego, Calif., to Brownsville, the surging caseloads\nare the result of tougher drug and immigration laws, more agents\nenforcing them and perhaps more illegal activity. The government is\nalso spending more money than ever to prosecute offenders in\nfederal court, a signal that drugs and immigration are a nationwide\npriority.\n\n   The problem may best be illustrated here in El Paso, where the\nmore than 800 federal criminal indictments in the 12 months\nfollowing Oct. 1, 1996, comprised nearly half of those in the\nentire western district of Texas, an area that includes both Austin\nand San Antonio.\n\n   The indictments here are expected to double in the current\nfiscal year, delaying civil proceedings and forcing federal\nofficials to rent county jail space in far-away locales such as\nGroesbeck, some 650 miles to the east.\n\n   ``We're inundated,'' said Sam Ponder, an assistant U.S. attorney\nwho heads the El Paso office. ``I've got five attorneys who handle\nthe international bridges, each with about 100 cases. They can't\neven remember who the defendants are.''\n\n   In tiny Pecos, whose jurisdiction is the Big Bend borderlands,\nthe federal criminal caseload jumped to 253 in the 12 months\nfollowing Oct. 1, 1996, from 47 the year before, an increase of\nmore than 400 percent. The numbers could go higher this year.\n\n   The western district of Texas, which includes the border from El\nPaso to Del Rio, and the state's southern district, which includes\nthe stretch of international boundary from Del Rio to Brownsville,\nnow rank second and third respectively behind Southern California\nin criminal cases filed.\n\n   While the numbers of indictments along the border are\nunprecedented, they have not yet reached the levels of Houston,\nwhere this year's caseload has already topped 1,900. Still,\nconsidering that Houston dwarfs the border cities in size, the\nincrease in places like El Paso is astonishing.\n\n   ``Border crime has always been there,'' said Bill Blagg, U.S.\nattorney for the western district. ``The difference is that now,\nour resources are having an impact.''\n\n   While the mushrooming statistics are encouraging to some,\nsignaling success in the war on drugs and illegal immigration, they\nare alarming to others.\n\n   At issue is not only whether the federal system can handle the\ncrush, but also the cost of it. The crackdown along the nation's\nsouthern flank, which requires everything from a bigger Border\nPatrol to more prosecutors to more prison space, is draining\nhundreds of millions dollars from federal coffers.\n\n   Then there is the question of equity. Border cities such as El\nPaso say they have more than their share of the criminal burden but\nnot of the resources. El Paso has far fewer U.S. attorneys and\nfederal judges than San Antonio, for example, a city whose criminal\ncaseload is much lighter. (San Antonio's civil backlog does exceed\nthat of El Paso, however.)\n\n   The biggest question may be whether the crackdown is indeed\nstemming the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants. Despite the\nnumbers, the flow of drugs in particular remains a pressing\nproblem, and some at the center of the justice system are doubting\nthe government's strategy.\n\n   ``Are we making progress?'' said Harry Lee Hudspeth, one of two\nfederal judges in El Paso, which lies across the border from Ciudad\nJuarez, Mexico, a city of more then 1.5 million.\n\n   ``I'm skeptical.''\n\n   Measuring the success in the drug war is not easy. But increased\ninterdiction along the U.S.-Mexico border does not appear to have\nforced the price of narcotics up, which would likely be the case if\ndemand surpassed supply. Nor does America's hunger for illegal\ndrugs seem to have subsided.\n\n   ``It's depressing all the way around,'' said Hudspeth. The\ngovernment, the judge said, is mistaken in thinking that more\nseizures and stiffer drug penalties in federal court can address\nwhat he believes is a more complicated problem.\n\n   The same issue is being debated on an international stage. At a\nUnited Nations special session earlier this month, drug-producing\ncountries demanded that the United States address its own appetite\nfor narcotics rather than wage a global war on drugs. Nationally,\nthe war on drugs is also catching flak.\n\n   ``The problem is demand,'' said Daniel Abrahamson, director of\nlegal affairs for the Lindemith Center, which advocates more\nliberal drug policies. ``This is a public health issue, not a\ncriminal justice issue.''\n\n   To the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the\nissue is one of public health and criminal justice, with the latter\ngetting the bulk of the resources. Some of that money is earmarked\nfor drug enforcement in El Paso, one of several federally\ndesignated priority areas in Texas.\n\n   Likewise, Congress is opening up its pocketbook for border\nenforcement, authorizing a 118 percent jump in the Border Patrol's\n$818 million operating budget since 1994. In El Paso, that means\nnearly 1,000 agents policing the international boundary, compared\nwith some 600 four years ago.\n\n   Seizures are up, as are arrests along the border. The problem is\nthat most of these drug and immigration offenders are bit players.\nThis is especially true in narcotics trafficking, with so-called\nmules hired to carry drugs clogging the courts and the kingpins\ncarrying on.\n\n   Some prosecutors say they are so consumed with routine drug and\nimmigration cases that they lack the time to build more\ncomprehensive cases that presumably could strike closer to the\nheart of the problem.\n\n   A typical defendant, ``plain vanilla,'' in the words of an El\nPaso federal public defender, was Ricardo Ruvalcaba Vera, a\ncollege-bound 19-year-old from Juarez who was offered $500 to drive\n1982 Chrysler Le Baron through the Ysleta port of entry and leave\nit, keys and all, at a nearby convenience store.\n\n   From there, prosecutors presume, the car was to be driven to an\nEl Paso warehouse where the drugs would be stored.\n\n   But the car was searched at the bridge last January and, with\nthe help of drug-sniffing dogs, U.S. agents recovered 70 pounds of\nmarijuana. As for Ruvalcaba, he was sentenced last week in\nHudspeth's courtroom to about a year in prison.\n\n   ``It was foolish,'' said Ruvalcaba, a polite, somewhat shy young\nman who lately has been shuttling back and forth between El Paso\nand Kermit, some 250 miles away, where some of the 500 or so\noverflow El Paso federal prisoners are held during their court\nproceedings. If convicted, they are sent to a federal prison.\n\n   ``I've never before had a problem with the police,'' he said.\n``It's been quite an experience.''\n\n   Ruvalcaba will probably be of little help to U.S. officials\nwanting to break Mexican smuggling rings. He knows the man who made\nthe $500 offer one night at the ElectriQ nightclub only as\n``Lalo.'' U.S. officials say that's the way the Mexican traffickers\noperate _ no questions asked.\n\n   While Judge Hudspeth sees little benefit in jamming the federal\njustice system with prisoners like this, U.S. Attorney Blagg says\nthey can lead to good tips. Last month, he said, prosecutors used\ninformation gleaned from drug haulers to return indictments on two\nsizable rings operating near Pecos.\n\n   What's more, law enforcement agents say, every ounce of\nnarcotics and every laundered dollar seized is a skirmish won in\nthe war on drugs. Last year, in fact, U.S. Customs agents at El\nPaso's Bridge of the Americas confiscated $5.6 million in a\ntractor-trailer headed south, thought to be a drug payoff.\n\n   Law enforcement agents say such seizures can put drug\ntraffickers on the run. While the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency does\nnot take credit for the fall of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the\ninfamous Juarez kingpin who died last year while apparently trying\nto disguise himself with plastic surgery, agents say they played a\nrole.\n\n   ``Would Amado Carrillo have tried to change his looks if we\nweren't making a difference,'' said Thomas Kennedy, assistant\nspecial agent in charge for the DEA office in El Paso. ``Obviously\nwe were having some impact if he was trying to hide from us.''\n\n   U.S. officials hope the same sort of incremental strategy will\nturn the illegal immigration tide. Armed with technology that\nallows them to identify deportees trying to return and call up\ntheir criminal history, officials are prosecuting immigrants who\nbefore simply would have been bused back to Mexico.\n\n   One is Javier de la Torre Reyes, who last week appeared before a\nfederal magistrate in El Paso. Having been previously been deported\nafter serving time for shoplifting, he was nabbed at a port of\nentry when he tried to pass himself off as a U.S. citizen. Now the\n32-year-old Juarez man is looking at up to eight months in prison.\n\n   Immigration law is especially harsh on felons, who can get up to\n20 years for trying to enter the United States illegally, even\nafter they have served their time in U.S. prisons. Federal public\ndefenders say this is excessive, particularly in a community like\nEl Paso, where the back-and-forth from Mexico is part of daily\nlife.\n\n   But Blagg said the harsh immigration laws, and the federal drug\nstatutes, have prompted a decrease in theft and violent crime along\nthe border _ at least on the U.S. side.\n\n   ``If we target the right people, if we prosecute them, if we put\nthem in jail for a significant time,'' he said, ``we can have an\nimpact.''\n\n     \n   \nXXXXXXEND OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nRECORD NUMBER OF CRIMINAL CASES ON BORDER \n\n","Text":["\n   The federal justice system along the U.S.-Mexico border is\nexperiencing record criminal caseloads, with drug and immigration\noffenders clogging courts and crowding prisons.\n","\n   From San Diego, Calif., to Brownsville, the surging caseloads\nare the result of tougher drug and immigration laws, more agents\nenforcing them and perhaps more illegal activity.
