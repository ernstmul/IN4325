Times News Service   \n\n   PINE HILL, N.J. _ When Shayna Barford was transferred from a\nparochial school to Overbrook Regional Senior High School here last\nApril, she had never experienced a bomb threat.

Last year, there were more than 30 such\nevacuations, all sparked by anonymous telephone calls to 911. And\nlast week, Overbrook High received a bomb threat every day, causing\nstudents to lose eight hours of class time.\n\n   ``It's dumb because it takes away from the kids who want to\nlearn,'' Shayna said.\n\n   But to law enforcement authorities and school administrators, it\nis more than stupid, so when students arrived for class on Monday,\ntheir campus resembled the scene of a hostage standoff: Armed\nofficers wearing black combat pants stood guard atop the roof,\nwhile four patrol cars and uniformed police officers monitored the\ngrounds, amid video cameras and microphones.\n\n   Police Chief Judd Booker said the show of force was intended to\nease the fears of students and parents who have threatened to keep\ntheir children at home. But it apparently did little to deter the\nhoaxers, who issued two more bomb threats during the day. ``Enough\nis enough,'' Booker said. ``I mean we have to end this pattern of\nevery day. We'll do whatever it takes.''\n\n   Until the spate of bomb threats began last year, the Camden\nCounty school, situated about half way between Atlantic City and\nPhiladelphia, was known for little more than its successful\nfootball team, the Rams, which this weekend won the Group Four\nstate championship.\n\n   In fact, when the first calls trickled in a year ago, the\ntemptation was to write off the hoaxes as a symptom of suburban\nennui _ a nuisance, but far more manageable that the guns and\nviolence plaguing many inner-city districts. But the threats have\npersisted for so long and involved so many different students that\neven those not given to introspection wonder what has made\nOverbrook the bomb threat capital of New Jersey.\n\n   Superintendent Michael Shreiner said the threats did not seem to\nbe the work of students angered by particular grievances but rather\na snowballing series of pranks that had left faculty members\nfrustrated and angry. ``We pride ourselves in our teacher-student\ncontact,'' he said. ``That's what education is all about, teachers\nworking directly with kids.''\n\n   Some students theorized that the hoaxes were a diversionary\ntactic carried out by those who wanted to avoid class.\n\n   Joe Rodgers, an 11th-grader who had skipped class to smoke a\ncigarette with friends Monday morning, said he hoped the school\nwould be evacuated again because it was ``perfect bomb-threat\nweather.''\n\n   ``We sit out there in the field and do nothing,'' he said.\n``It's time off from class, and they can't do nothing about it.''\n\n   But some students said they had grown weary of the disruption.\nKaren Abernathy said she had to make up three papers as homework\nlast week after missing three straight world history classes. She\nalso complained that the police presence made it harder for her to\nskip class.\n\n   Booker said the police had had difficulty tracing the calls,\nwhich were made from various pay phones around the county and from\ncellular phones. To check students' phone records, officials have\nbeen forced to obtain search warrants, he said. The department has\nalso relied on undercover surveillance, including stakeouts, he\nsaid.\n\n   So far, the department has identified dozens of suspects,\nlargely through other students' informing on them.
