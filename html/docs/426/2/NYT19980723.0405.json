Times News Service   \n\n   ANDREWS, N.C. _ There is a part of this town that is rooting for\nEric Robert Rudolph to elude the camouflaged G-men and their\ndroopy-eared bloodhounds, and not just because the six-month search\nfor the man accused of bombing an Alabama abortion clinic has been\ngood for business.\n\n   As search teams of rifle-toting agents fan through the dense\nrhododendron of the Nantahala National Forest, there is a degree of\nlocal pride in the ability of a ninth-grade dropout to outwit more\nthan 200 investigators equipped with motion detectors and\nhelicopters with heat sensors.\n\n   Factor in an underlayer of anti-abortion sentiment and the\ninnate distrust of government that is native to the mountains of\nwestern North Carolina and it begins to explain why a local man has\nsold more than 200 T-shirts bearing the chant: ``Run Rudolph Run.''\n\n   Rudolph has been charged in the Birmingham, Ala., attack, which\nkilled an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse.\nThe authorities want to question him about three other bombings in\nAtlanta in 1996 and 1997, including the pipe-bomb explosion at\nCentennial Olympic Park on July 27, 1996, that killed one woman and\ninjured 111 people.\n\n   Sukey S. Reid, a 55-year-old artist who lives in Nantahala,\nRudolph's boyhood home, said she was one of those who hoped that\nthe fugitive would be found and safely captured. But as she watched\nsix heavily armed agents climb into the woods this morning to begin\ntheir daily search, she acknowledged feeling a certain empathy for\nRudolph, who has been on the FBI's list of the 10 most wanted\nfugitives since May.\n\n   ``I think it's human nature,'' she said. ``Yeah, we all know\nhe's bad. But there's something about a human being being hunted\ndown by dogs in the woods. It's like he's an animal. People say,\n`Oh, the poor little guy.' ''\n\n   Like many people here, Laurie D. Barlow, a 30-year-old tanning\nsalon owner, questions the case against Rudolph and argues that\nsome of the evidence linking him to a series of bombings must have\nbeen planted.\n\n   ``He's running now because he knows they're looking for a\nscapegoat,'' she said. ``But he's a heck of a lot smarter than 200\nFBI agents. They might be smart in the city but they sure don't\nknow the mountains.''\n\n   Town leaders and others entrusted with protecting the area's\nimage are not proud of such sentiment, and they assert that it does\nnot represent anything close to a majority view.\n\n   ``People around here don't condone what he's done,'' said Jim C.\nHutto, one of three barbers in Andrews and a member of the town\nboard. ``But the longer it goes on the more people lean toward him.\nThey think he's one man and they've got all these people and all\nthis sophisticated equipment looking for him. It sort of makes him\nan underdog.''\n\n   The perception of Rudolph as a sympathetic outlaw is prevalent\nenough that the widow of the police officer who was killed in the\nBirmingham attack came here Wednesday to confront some local\nresidents who in TV interviews have called Rudolph a folk hero.\n\n   ``He's a murderer, a terrorist,'' said Felecia Sanderson, whose\nhusband, Robert, was killed in an explosion Jan. 29 at the New\nWoman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham.\n\n   The Asheville Citizen-Times, the nearest daily newspaper, also\ntook note of the area's ambivalence about Rudolph's capture in an\neditorial on Tuesday. ``There's a natural inclination to root for\none man against the odds,'' the editorial observed. But in this\ncase, the newspaper said, such attitudes ``should dismay anyone who\nwants to continue living in a country governed by law rather than\nanarchy.''\n\n   The division of opinion here is simply the latest oddity in a\ncase that has been bizarre from the beginning. This is the same\ninvestigation that led Rudolph's older brother, Daniel, to produce\na videotaped message to the FBI in March that showed him using a\npower saw to amputate his left hand.\n\n   The FBI has offered a $1 million reward for Eric Rudolph, a\n31-year-old carpenter whose family moved from south Florida into\nthese foggy hills when he was a teen-ager. He has been on the run,\npresumably in the woods, since the day after the Birmingham\nbombing, when police first identified him by tracing the license\nplate number of a car seen by witnesses.\n\n   Last week, the multiagency task force that is pursuing Rudolph\nannounced that a hungry Rudolph had emerged from the woods on July\n7 and made contact with George O. Nordmann, the owner of a health\nfood store in Andrews who has known Rudolph for years. Two days\nlater, Rudolph returned to Nordmann's house, which is deep in the\nwoods, and took a large quantity of food and Nordmann's blue 1977\nNissan pickup truck.\n\n   nn\n\n   Nordmann, who was not home when the food and truck were taken,\ndid not report the encounter or the theft until July 11.\nInvestigators found the abandoned truck at a nearby campground on\nJuly 13, setting off the nonstop, day-and-night manhunt.\n\n   On Wednesday, Woody Enderson, the FBI agent leading the task\nforce, said that search teams had found a number of small campsites\nthat Rudolph may have used. At one such site, they found buried\ntrash that bore Rudolph's fingerprint. Enderson did not say how\nlong ago Rudolph may have been at the site, but other\nlaw-enforcement officials said they believed he might have used it\nmore than two weeks ago to surveil Nordmann's house.\n\n   Among the qualities that some residents find endearing about\nRudolph is his apparent consideration for Nordmann. He left five\n$100 bills to pay for the food he purloined and left a handwritten\nnote in the truck identifying Nordmann as its owner,\nlaw-enforcement officials have said.\n\n   By now, the search has taken on the surreal quality of a daily\nritual, as has the interaction between the investigators and a\nsizable encampment of journalists. Federal, state and local agents\ngather each morning at the U.S. Forest Service's Appletree\ncampground, which has been transformed into a command post.\n\n   As teams of six to eight agents leave the post for trails in\nTellico Gap or at the top of Winding Staircase Road, they are\nfollowed by tire-screeching convoys of reporters and cameramen\ndesperate to send CNN and NBC their daily footage of agents with\ntheir guns and dogs. The journalists film the agents as they\nembark, but have respected the agents' requests that they be\nallowed to search the woods alone.\n\n   Not surprisingly, false sightings and fruitless leads have\nbecome commonplace. On Tuesday night, a reported sighting _ later\nproven erroneous _ sent investigators and reporters racing into the\ndarkness. On another day, when a gunshot was heard within the\n30-square-mile search area, agents descended on a farmer who\nexplained that he was trying to exterminate a meddlesome rabbit.\n\n   Here in nearby Andrews, the town of 2,500 where the\ninvestigation is based, residents long for a return to the sleepy\nnormalcy of their purposefully peaceful lives. They complain that\nthe crush of television satellite trucks has made it hard to get a\nparking spot near the post office. Motels are so booked that one\ngiddy proprietor joked that he was hiding Rudolph in a second-floor\nguest room.\n\n   ``It's been good for business,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said. ``It's\nhelped the motels, the bed and breakfasts, the restaurants.''\n\n   But some business owners fear that the Rudolph case and its\naccompanying publicity may hurt the area in the long run. Already,\nsaid John Paul Jones, the owner of the Bradley Inn in Andrews,\ninnkeepers and river rafting outfitters have received cancellations\nfrom people who are scared to visit.\n\n   Rudolph's recent contact with Nordmann has revived the area's\nfavorite parlor game, in which people debate whether they would\nturn Rudolph in if he showed up on their doorsteps.
