He\nloved to play around,'' Lomax said before the funeral.\n\n   ``I really loved that dog. It's just kind of hard to let it go.\nIt really hurt to find out he had cancer,'' he said.\n\n   Besides his fellow canines, Hamlet's funeral was attended by his\nveterinarian and other agents from Customs, the U.S. Border Patrol,\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Eagle Pass police,\nand Mexican Customs. Eagle Pass is 150 miles west of San Antonio.\n\n   Most agents were dog handlers, and the Customs dog teams working\nthe two international bridges in Eagle Pass Thursday morning were\npulled off duty to attend the ceremony.\n\n   The common bond of the officers who attend was their four-footed\npartners and their shared sense of grief, and the loss was as real\nas the tears that appeared on Lomax's cheek.\n\n   ``It's like a parent-child relationship. In the Customs Service,\nwe take a new handler and put him with a new dog, and they work\ntogether, so after a few years, they develop a strong bond,'' said\nRobert Cagle, the team leader for the Customs' 14-dog canine squad\nand partner of Crocket, a chocolate lab.\n\n   ``He's your buddy, he's your pet, and he's your partner, and\nyou're taking care of him. The dog will defend the handler, take a\nbullet for him,'' said Trinidad Sanchez, an INS dog handler, whose\npartner is Eros, a German shepherd.\n\n   ``A good dog makes the handler look good, and a good handler\nmakes the dog look good. And when you lose one, it's like a death\nin the family,'' he said.\n\n   But for the failure of a bugler to show up and play taps, the\nfuneral service went off without a hitch. After the crowd has\ndispersed, calm returned, broken only by the sounds of eager\nbarking of the drug dogs waiting to go to work.\n\n   ``It wasn't very long, but I think it was appropriate. And I\nthink it meant a lot to Mr. Lomax. We all would have felt the same\nway if it had been our dog too,'' Cagle said.\n","Headline":"\n      A SEVEN-GUN SALUTE, AND WHIMPERS, FOR OFFICER'S LAST RITES \n","Text":["\n   EAGLE PASS, Texas _ At the first blast from the seven-gun honor\nguard on Thursday, the barking and whimpering spectators fell\nsilent, as Labrador retrievers, German shepherds and dark-faced\nBelgian Malanois looked anxiously at their handlers.\n","\n   By the third and final blast, they were petrified.\n","\n   As service funerals go, the one observed outside the Canine\nEnforcement Section kennels near the Camino Real International\nBridge was short and to the point, but not without pathos.\n","\n   ``We are gathered here today to honor a fallen comrade, not an\nofficer, but Hamlet, a loyal canine,'' began the eulogy by John\nSalazar, the U.S. Customs Service port director for Eagle Pass.\n","\n   At Salazar's right on a small table, was an urn containing\nHamlet's ashes, a bouquet of flowers, and the wooden badge, bearing\nnumber 6C-66, that until recently had been attached to Hamlet's\nkennel door.\n","\n   ``Hamlet had not been in the field very long, barely two years,\nbut he had already made his mark, intercepting over $7 million in\ndrugs, with excellent seizures of cocaine and marijuana,'' he said.\n","\n   The four-year-old yellow Labrador retriever died of cancer on\nMarch 15.\n","\n   The funeral was held at the suggestion of Hamlet's handler,\nCustoms agent Percy Lomax, who had trained with him at the\nservice's canine school in Virginia, and then worked with him in\nEagle Pass for the last two years.\n","\n   ``He was mellow, the mellowest dog here, but fun-loving.
