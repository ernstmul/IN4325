Times News Service   \n\n   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Because of the risk to the soldiers, the\nPentagon has refused to allow U.S. troops to return to northern\nMitrovica, the section dominated by Serbs in the divided town that\nhas become a flash point of ethnic tension in Kosovo, senior United\nNations and Western officials say.\n\n   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany, the commander of the NATO-led\npeacekeeping forces in Kosovo known as KFOR, said negotiations were\ncontinuing.\n\n   Asked directly in an interview here Sunday whether the United\nStates had refused to send troops back to northern Mitrovica,\nReinhardt paused for a time and then said: ``Your question comes a\ncouple of days too early. We're working on this question.''\n\n   Reinhardt has pushed hard to internationalize the KFOR troops in\nMitrovica, which is in the French zone of Kosovo. When American\ntroops first entered the north to search for weapons a week ago,\nangry Serbs hurled snowballs, stones and bricks at them, and they\nfinally withdrew. The soldiers were criticized for aggressive\ntactics such as breaking down doors.\n\n   The general said that because he did not want the Serbs to\ndictate who would patrol northern Mitrovica, he sent U.S. and\nGerman troops back into the north a few days later, but at 5 a.m.,\nto do a weapons search.\n\n   But officials here say the Americans, who are in charge of the\ntense eastern sector of Kosovo, do not want to send troops back to\nMitrovica. Reinhardt said many countries in the peacekeeping force\nthat had refused his requests to help patrol Mitrovica in November\nand December were now willing to take part after violence this\nmonth killed at least 11 people, most of them Albanian.\n\n   ``Today a lot of the restrictions on me that were in place in\nDecember are gone,'' the general said, praising the Swedes, Finns\nand Danes in particular for their willingness to take on the risks\nof Mitrovica. ``We'll see when the Americans go back there.''\n\n   Despite the Pentagon's reluctance, officials say that Secretary\nof State Madeleine Albright has been on the telephone almost daily\nwith Bernard Kouchner, the head of the U.N. mission here, urging a\nsolution to the Mitrovica issue.\n\n   Reinhardt also said he had pressed the Americans hard in the\nlast month to do a better job of securing Kosovo's eastern border\nwith the rest of Serbia. The goal there is to prevent armed\nAlbanians, some of them in uniform, from attacking targets inside\nSerbia proper, especially in the 3-mile-wide demilitarized zone\nwhere Serbian troops are not allowed to enter, although the police\nare.\n\n   Asked why such armed groups _ offshoots of the supposedly\ndismantled Kosovo Liberation Army _ were allowed to enter Serbia\nfrom Kosovo, the general bristled.\n\n   ``We're not allowing it,'' he said firmly, noting that KFOR had\narrested six armed people on Saturday trying to go across the\nborder. ``I told people to arrest anyone who tries to go out of our\nsector into eastern Kosovo. We close down the border as much as\npossible. We recognized that something was brewing, and my\ninstructions were to seal that border more hermetically before\nthere is a real crisis.''\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   American troops have now built watchtowers along the border with\nSerbia, near the towns of Bujanovac, Presevo and Medvedja, which\nhave majority Albanian populations and which more radical Albanians\nrefer to as ``eastern Kosovo.''\n\n   Armed Albanians wearing uniforms with shoulder patches like\nthose of the KLA, but representing an organization dubbed the\nLiberation Army of Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja, have been seen\nin the demilitarized zone. In response, the government of\nYugoslavia put four more militarized police units into the area,\nalarming NATO officials.\n\n   The area is also known as an entry point for drug smuggling, and\nReinhardt said he was still asking capitals for specialized\nofficers in drug interdiction. The U.N. police, badly under\nstrength, has also requested officers with such expertise, but in\nvain.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The official Yugoslav press agency, Tanjug, reported Sunday that\na Serbian policeman and an ethnic Albanian guerrilla were killed on\nSaturday night and three Serb policemen were wounded in a shootout\nnear the village of Konculj, when Albanians ambushed a police\npatrol with automatic weapons and hand grenades.\n\n   It was the third recent attack against the police in the area.\nThe Serbian police said a bomb damaged the courthouse in Bujanovac\non Friday night, in an attack they blamed on ``Albanian\nterrorists.''\n\n   Western officials have accused Belgrade of trying to destabilize\nKosovo, while the Yugoslavs accuse KFOR of not stopping the\ninfiltration of armed Albanians from Kosovo.\n\n   nn\n\n   Reinhardt said the Kosovo peacekeeping force was now operating\nmore intensely to check the province's northern border with Serbia\nproper, above Mitrovica, to prevent the flow of arms and undercover\npolice or intelligence officers into Kosovo from Serbia.\n\n   Danish and Belgian battalions are checking vehicles more\nvigorously, he said, and last week the peacekeepers began to use a\ncomputer at a checkpoint to register who goes in and out. Although\nKosovo is formally part of Yugoslavia, KFOR says it has the right\nto deny entrance to suspicious people or to deport them.\n\n   ``Normally the military does not do such work,'' Reinhardt said.\n``But there is no point in complaining. This is an area of big\nconcern for me, and I have sent officers with specialized training\nto assist in this job, and I have sent my deputy to supervise, and\nI'm feeling very comfortable'' about the security of northern\nKosovo.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The general said he had been getting most of the money and\npersonnel he needed for his military operation, but that the NATO\ngovernments ``that decided to get us here'' were less supportive of\nthe U.N. civilian administration here.\n\n   In particular, he said, the failure to send promised funding for\nthe civilian budget and to send promised international police\nofficers has meant that his troops must do a great deal more\npolicing than they want to do, or are trained or equipped to do.\nWith only 2,000 international police officers here, he said,\nconsiderably fewer than 800 are on the streets on any given day.\n\n   ``We're missing 3,000 police officers,'' said the general, who\nhas initiated joint patrols by his troops with the police. ``But\nthere's no use complaining. It won't change the situation, so I\nhave to make the best out of it.''\n\n   The lack of international prosecutors and judges also annoys\nhim, and he acknowledged the reluctance of Albanian prosecutors and\njudges to convict other Albanians.\n\n   Last week, he said, two Serbs were killed and KFOR soldiers\nimmediately arrested suspects, having tracked them with dogs, and\nfound the weapons used. ``They turned these guys over to the police\nand the prosecutor, and the prosecutor released them the same\nday,'' he said. ``How can we enforce law and order if this takes\nplace?''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Reinhardt admitted with a degree of embarrassment that someone\nin Mitrovica had stolen his personal revolver while Albanians were\ncheering him last Monday, as he sought to defuse a large Albanian\ndemonstration. Normally the weapon is secured to his holster on a\ncable, but the day before, the ring attaching the pistol and the\ncable broke, he said.\n\n   ``People were touching me and pulling me and shaking my hands,\nand it just went,'' he said. ``It happened. So what? For me the key\nthing was to prevent the crowd from becoming violent, and when we\ntold them to go home, they went.''\n","Headline":"\nNATO GENERAL HOPES GI'S WILL RETURN TO KOSOVO TOWN\n","Text":["\n   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Because of the risk to the soldiers, the\nPentagon has refused to allow U.S. troops to return to northern\nMitrovica, the section dominated by Serbs in the divided town that\nhas become a flash point of ethnic tension in Kosovo, senior United\nNations and Western officials say.\n","\n   Gen.
