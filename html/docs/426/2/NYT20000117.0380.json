Times News Service clients)  \n BY PAT FLANNERY AND DENNIS WAGNER  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n     \n(PHOENIX) - Smugglers will do anything, use anyone, to get drugs\ninto the United States.\n\n   They stitch cash into a cadaver and drive across the border.\n\n   They hide a load of marijuana under the seat of a car and place\na sick old man on top, his intravenous drip by his side.\n\n   They hide drugs on their own kids, or hire poor children off the\nstreets. Kids, they rationalize, won't be punished much if they're\ncaught.   \nTHE TACTICS\n\n   They buy hair spray, empty the cans and stuff drugs inside, or\nthey cut open boxes of Tide, empty most of the detergent and\nreplace it with drug cash to send south.\n\n   They hollow out car doors, the backs of seats and the insides of\ncushions. They hide pot in removable dashboards, in false pickup\ntruck beds and fake fenders, in tires, around motors and over\ntransmissions.\n\n   They buy a new Nissan Sentra and weld vacuum-sealed metal\ncontainers, each containing 14 pounds of cocaine, to wheel rims.\nThey buy a used Ford Explorer, weld a small fuel container inside\nthe gas tank, then jam the rest of the tank with 50 pounds of\ncocaine.\n\n   They build false ceilings into tractor-trailers, false walls\ninto railroad cars and false floors into airplanes.\n\n   They fly bales of marijuana over the desert and kick them out to\nallies waiting below.\n\n   They tunnel under the border and into U.S. homes, hoisting\nbundles of cocaine to allies waiting above.\n\n   Even their own bodies are not sacred.\n\n   Hikers strap 30- to 50-pound bales to their backs and navigate\nperilous desert and mountain trails into Arizona. They conceal\ntheir tracks every way possible, crossing dirt border roads on\nplanks _ even pole vaulting across.\n\n   They hide everything from heroin to anabolic steroids in the\nhollowed heels of running shoes. They stuff balloons of cocaine\ninto every human orifice _ or swallow them, and hope they pass\nthrough their bodies before the balloons burst.\n\n   They tape cash to their torsos and cocaine to their crotches.\n\n   One man rolled an old tire across the Naco border road and let\nit flop to the ground in a dusty American trailer court. A Border\nPatrol agent checking it out could hardly lift the tire. It was\nstuffed with drugs.\n\n   But unlike the tire roller, most smugglers are using\nincreasingly sophisticated ways to send hot cargoes over the line,\nsaid Jesus Cruz, chief Customs inspector at Nogales' commercial\nport.\n\n   And with the increase in border traffic spurred by the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, ``they're even using (legitimate)\ncargo to hide drugs,'' Cruz said.   \nTHE HIDING SPOT\n\n   Last year, inspectors were suspicious of two tractor diesel\nengines headed to Michigan for refurbishing. Disassembling the\nmotors, they found the pistons and oil pans missing. Packed tight\nin their place: a load of cocaine.\n\n   That kind of creativity is no longer unusual. Inspectors found\nelectrical transformers headed to Fargo, N.D., gutted and refilled\nwith cocaine. On one memorable occasion, Nogales inspectors drilled\ninto a northbound lumber load and found the timber had been\nhollowed and stuffed with more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine.\n\n   Customs Inspector Peter Bachelier, an expert on rail smuggling,\nsaid traffickers have been known to bury narcotics in the bottoms\nof U.S.-bound hopper cars loaded with commodities. They've hidden\nloads in or on brand new Ford Escorts being delivered by rail from\nHermosillo to Arizona. Now, every train and its cargo are searched\nat the border.\n\n   Yuma police Lt. Doug Lee said it's impossible to profile\nsmugglers because their tactics are so varied.\n\n   Sometimes, they use old junkers and sometimes brand new cars to\ndrive drugs across the border. The drivers usually know very little\nabout who the drugs came from or where they're going. The system\nkeeps Mexican sources and U.S. warehouses from being discovered if\nthe drugs are busted en route, Lee said.\n\n   Often, a small load is sent across the border near a big load,\nwith smugglers using it to distract inspectors.   \nTHE DECOY\n\n   On a cool evening last February, Douglas Customs Inspector Jim\nPower had his dog named Once sniffing for dope haulers.\n\n   Cars in seven lanes were backed up into Agua Prieta, spewing\nfumes. It was quiet until a young Hispanic suddenly leaped from a\nbeat-up Mazda near the inspection booth and took off running south.\n\n   Uniformed men and women swarmed the car, tapping it with density\nmeters, looking underneath with mirrors, reaching behinds seats.\n\n   They rolled the Mazda aside for a more thorough check as Once\nmoved in, tail wagging. The dog went nuts around the left front\nbumper, scratching and whining.\n\n   The hood popped open and a single brick of marijuana rested in\nplain view behind the headlight. Instead of celebrating, one of the\ninspectors shouted, ``It's a decoy. Stop the lines! Close it\ndown!''\n\n   Within minutes, scores of cars were backed up and dogs were\nrunning up and down the lines.\n\n   Inspector Clarissa Velasco used a fiber-optic medical scope to\npeer inside the Mazda's gas tank. Others combed the sedan's\ninterior, finding only a beer can and a key, still in the ignition.\nThat was another tip-off: Most people have a bunch of keys on their\nchain.\n\n   A second brick of pot was in the trunk.\n\n   ``This is a throwaway,'' Velasco said. ``I'll betcha a big load\nof coke went in right ahead of this, and we lost it.''\n\n   Everyone nodded. The Mazda and cannabis were sacrificed by\nsmugglers, written off as a cost of doing business.\n\n   Soon, traffic was moving again. The inspectors took their posts,\nwaiting for the next load.   \n   \nABOUT THIS SERIES   \n   \nDuring a seven-month investigation, Arizona Republic reporters\nspoke to dozens of drug officers, smugglers, counselors and\nresidents on the Mexican border.
