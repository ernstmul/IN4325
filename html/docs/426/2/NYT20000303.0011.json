PETTERSON  \n c. 2000 Kansas City Star  \n\n   HIAWATHA, Kan. _ Law officers in Kansas and New York searched\nfor clues Thursday that might explain what led a runaway from\nBuffalo, N.Y., to a deadly encounter with a part-time sheriff's\ndeputy halfway across the country.\n\n   Vincent A. Smith, 16, the son of a Buffalo police lieutenant,\napparently shot and killed Todd Widman, 21, a deputy sheriff in\nBrown County, Kan., on Wednesday night in Hiawatha. About three\nhours later, Smith was shot to death by two Kansas Highway Patrol\ntroopers.\n\n   Smith was reported missing Tuesday afternoon by his father, Lt.\nThomas C. Smith, a 29-year police veteran in Buffalo. A\nmissing-person report said the youth had taken his mother's 1988\nFord Tempo and a Walther PPK semiautomatic pistol owned by his\nfather, according to Lt. Larry Baehre, a Buffalo police spokesman.\n\n   ``We're all scratching our heads as to why he was heading that\nway and what this was all about,'' Baehre said.\n\n   He said there was no indication of problems in the Smith home.\n\n   The Buffalo News reported that Smith apparently was distraught\nover bad grades, but authorities in Kansas and Buffalo said they\ncould not confirm that.\n\n   ``He was a nonviolent kid,'' said Sam Carroll, a classmate at\nBuffalo's Bishop Timon-St. Jude High School. ``Never got in\nscuffles. He was just easy to get along with.''\n\n   The Brown County Sheriff's Department said early Thursday\nevening that there were no reports that Smith was involved in any\nother incidents as he made his way toward Kansas. His mother's car\nwas found abandoned just off Interstate 29 in northwest Missouri,\nnear the Kansas state line, according to Special Agent Scott\nTeeselink of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.\n\n   Early Wednesday evening, Widman responded to a report of a\nsuspicious person walking along U.S. 73 north of Hiawatha, a town\nof about 3,600 in extreme northeast Kansas.\n\n   ``Believing the individual was a runaway juvenile, the deputy\nattempted to transport the individual to the Brown County sheriff's\noffice for further investigation,'' Sheriff Lamar Shoemaker said.\n\n   Minutes later, about 7 p.m., Widman radioed from his car that he\nhad been shot. Emergency medical crews took him to the Hiawatha\nCommunity Hospital, where he died from gunshot wounds, authorities\nsaid.\n\n   Sgt. John Eichkorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol said Widman was\nshot while in his car.\n\n   It was not clear whether Smith had been searched before the\nshooting. The gun may have been in a duffel bag Smith was carrying,\nauthorities said.\n\n   State and local law enforcement agencies converged on the area\nafter the shooting.\n\n   Smith was spotted near a Wal-Mart store at the west edge of\nHiawatha, and there was an exchange of gunfire. No one was hit, and\nSmith escaped, Shoemaker said.\n\n   Minutes later, Shoemaker said, Smith was seen walking west of\nHiawatha along U.S. 36. A Highway Patrol helicopter and airplane\njoined in the search, and tracking dogs were brought in.\n\n   About 9:45 p.m., officers who were searching the area were fired\non by the suspect after he emerged from a field.\n\n   ``The officers immediately returned fire,'' Shoemaker said. ``In\nthis exchange of gunfire, the suspect was struck and fatally\ninjured.''\n\n   Two veteran Highway Patrol troopers have been placed on\nadministrative leave while the shooting is investigated. The\nprocedure is routine in such cases.\n\n   A day after the shootings, the American flag outside the Brown\nCounty sheriff's office flew at half-staff, and officers wore\nstrips of black tape across their badges.\n\n   Speaking at a midmorning press conference on Thursday, Shoemaker\nsaid Widman had worked part time for the department for the last\nseveral months, serving court papers and working in the jail.\n\n   He was a 1997 graduate of Hiawatha High School and was\ncompleting a degree in criminal justice at Washburn University in\nTopeka, Kan. He had not yet taken the state-mandated law\nenforcement training course.\n\n   ``He was a very fine young man,'' said John Severin, Hiawatha's\nschool superintendent. ``He was well-liked by the students in his\nclass and the students in the school.''\n\n   Widman's sister is a junior at Hiawatha High School, and his\nmother is employed there.\n\n   Since graduating from high school, Widman had worked for the\nschool district's maintenance crew during the summers, Severin\nsaid.\n\n   Counselors were available for students and staff at the school\nand for Widman's colleagues in the Sheriff's Department.\n\n   Asked about Widman's colleagues, the sheriff said, ``They are\nholding up as well as they can.''\n\n   Eichkorn said: ``We all tend to take law enforcement for\ngranted.
