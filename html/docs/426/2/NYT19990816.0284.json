Times News Service   \n\n   FRONT ROYAL, Va. _ Abbey loved to play, so much so that her\ndistraught owner gave her to a dog pound. Who, after all, wanted a\nChesapeake Bay retriever whose notion of fun was chewing up the\ncurtains?\n\n   The United States Customs Service did. It recruited Abbey, who\notherwise might have been destroyed, and taught her to sniff out\nillegal drugs. During her three-year tenure at Miami International\nAirport, Abbey _ or more accurately, Abbey's nose _ has been\nresponsible for more than 155 seizures of smuggled cocaine and\nheroin, worth $25 million on the street.\n\n   How dogs like Abbey can find anything in the confusion of an\nairport terminal is explained not just by their keen sense of\nsmell, developed over thousands of years of hunting for food and\nfleeing predators, but also by scientists' increasing understanding\nof this olfactory ability, and the sophisticated training\ntechniques developed to exploit it.\n\n   Customs trains its dogs to respond to a variety of odors, all of\nthem associated with a rolled towel saturated with the scent of a\npseudo-narcotic. ``In their mind, they're looking for the towel,''\nsaid Tim Spittler, another canine enforcement officer. ``They don't\nthink they're looking for narcotics.''\n\n   The Customs Service recruits about 1,000 dogs a year, 90 percent\nof whom are plucked from animal shelters. Most are Labrador\nretrievers, goldens and other breeds that are inclined to hunt and\nfetch and are large enough to jump onto cargo and baggage\ncarousels.\n\n   ``The dog that sits in front of the fireplace is a dog we can't\ntrain,'' said Officer Spittler, who recruits from animal shelters\nand kennels in Ohio and Michigan. ``We want the dog that wants to\nplay hide and seek.''\n\n   The affability of the favored breeds, he said, makes them less\nthreatening to travelers. Customs rejects dogs that look aggressive\nor are spooked by loud noises and sudden movements.\n\n   At the Customs Canine Enforcement Training Center in Front\nRoyal, in the rolling foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the\ndogs undergo 12 weeks of repetitive training. The first two weeks\nare largely spent playing with the rolled towel, as the dogs get to\nknow their handlers.\n\n   The towel is then doused with a narcotic scent and hidden inside\njunk cars or in suitcases rotating on a carousel. Whenever the dog\nfinds the towel, it is rewarded with lavish praise and a tug-of-war\nthat the handler deliberately loses.\n\n   ``Any time the dog smells the odor, he thinks the towel is\nhere,'' said Carl A. Newcombe, the director of the training center.\n\n   ``But we can't make a dog smell,'' he added. ``You've got to\ncreate the environment that makes the dog want to do it.''\n\n   Clearly, dogs use their noses far more than humans. But how much\nbetter is a dog's sense of smell?\n\n   ``Nobody knows,'' said Dr. Lawrence J. Myers, an associate\nprofessor of psychology and pharmacology at Auburn University's\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine. ``It's going to be different for\ndifferent odors.''\n\n   Myers, who has been investigating the sensory abilities of\ndetector dogs since 1982, is convinced their olfactory abilities\nfar outstrip those of their human counterparts. But are they\n``twenty, a thousand or a million times better? I don't know,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   When scientists dissected the nose of a German shepherd, Myers\nsaid, they found 20 times as many olfactory receptor cells as in a\nhuman nose. These complex sensory organs reside within mucous\nmembranes in the canine nasal cavity and are connected to the\nbrain's olfactory bulb.\n\n   Sniffing, he said, increases sensitivity to an odor by widening\nthe dog's nostrils to pull in more air. ``A sniff straightens the\nnasal cavity so the odorant hits straight to the olfactory\nmucosa,'' he said.\n\n   But Myers seemed more impressed by a dog's ability to sort out\nscents. ``That discrimination capability has to be something\nphenomenal, because they're doing this task around a lot of\ncontaminating odors,'' he said.\n\n   The customs training center teaches dogs to recognize heroin,\ncocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\n   ``If dogs are trained in all these odors, they can differentiate\nbetween them,'' Newcombe said. ``The dog identifies the individual\nodor. As long as the odor is present, the dog will be able to\nrespond to it.''\n\n   They respond so well that the training center stopped using\ndetergent to wash the towels used by the dogs for fear they might\nhome in on the laundry of returning travelers.\n\n   Some dogs specialize in detecting smuggled United States bank\nnotes by identifying the scent of currency paper and ink at amounts\nof around $10,000. ``We're training the dog on various levels of\ncurrency,'' Newcombe said, adding that the customs service uses\nshredded money from the Mint in training exercises.\n\n   Other dogs learn to sniff out explosives and weapons for the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\n   ``The ability to train dogs to detect odors is really subject to\nour own limitations,'' Officer Newcombe said. During a mission to\nSaudi Arabia, he said, ``We trained a dog on explosives, weapons\nand narcotics, and he did just fine.'' (Customs trains dogs for\nabout 30 countries, as well as for other government agencies in the\nUnited States.)\n\n   Dogs have uncovered new trends in smuggling like cocaine molded\ninto plastic machine parts from Argentina. And they continue to\nexpose older tricks. Officer Newcombe told of a customs dog in\nChicago that appeared to be obsessed with some imported concrete\nstatues. Inspectors took one statue to a hospital, where a CAT scan\nfound a lump of heroin inside.\n\n   ``The handler has got to believe what the dog is doing,''\nOfficer Newcombe said. ``He's got to trust it.'' Dr. Kenneth G.\nFurton, the chairman of the chemistry department at Florida\nInternational University in Miami and the director of the\nInternational Forensic Research Institute, has found detector dogs\nremarkably selective, even when smugglers try to mask a scent with\nmore pungent odors. ``If you put cocaine with coffee grounds,'' he\nsaid, ``dogs will find the cocaine.''\n\n   The dogs, Furton explained, ``are not smelling cocaine, but the\nodor of chemicals which dissipate from cocaine,'' notably\nmethylbenzoate, a tell-tale chemical emitted as cocaine breaks\ndown.\n\n   In a study comparing the performances of dogs and electronic\ndrug detectors, Furton, the dogs, he said, beat the detectors\n``hands down.''\n\n   Electronic detectors also are more prone to false alerts, he\nadded.\n\n   Dogs and electronic detectors both identify cocaine's signature\nodor, he said, but the dog processes it faster. ``Even though\ncomputers are very sophisticated now, they're not as sophisticated\nas a canine brain,'' Furton said.\n\n   nn\n\n   Except for marijuana, the dogs do not train with real narcotics,\nonly with synthetic scents because of the dangers of heroin and\ncocaine.\n\n   ``If they bite into that, it would kill them,'' said John H.\nKrob, a course developer at the training center.\n\n   Before a detector dog is certified for duty, it must identify\nreal heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine borrowed from the center's\nlocked vault.\n\n   Some detector dogs are trained to be active, scratching and\nbiting at containers in the baggage tunnels. Others are passive,\nsitting down and wagging their tails when a drug scent emanates\nfrom a suitcase.\n\n   The Customs Service is working with its Australian counterpart\nto develop a so-called ``super-sniffer'' though the dogs are being\nbred more for physical dexterity than for increased olfactory\nsensitivity. Last year, the Australian Customs Service sent a dozen\nLabrador retrievers to be inseminated with sperm from Labradors at\nFront Royal.
