Defense\nattorneys estimate it costs at least $10,000, so many won't even\naccept a case unless the value of the seizure is large.  \n\n   {( Begin optional trim )}\n\n   Although many people whose property is seized are no doubt\nguilty of a crime, that doesn't mean all are.  \n\n   Charlotte Carroll, a disabled, 64-year-old Maryland woman, could\nlose her house because police found a third of an ounce of cocaine\nand other drugs that some of her children left there.  \n\n   Under Maryland law, a house usually can't be forfeited without a\ncriminal conviction. Police tapped the federal government to\nforfeit the three-acre property, which has been in Carroll's family\nfor a century.  \n\n   ``I got sick, so sick in my stomach and started crying,''\nCarroll said. ``I'm just praying.''  \n\n   Carroll, who has osteoarthritis and receives $500 a month from\nSocial Security disability, has never been convicted of a crime,\nher attorney said.  \n\n   ``The state can't take her house, so they run to the feds,''\nsaid the attorney, Stephen F. Allen.  \n\n   Carroll continues to live in the home while Allen fights the\nforfeiture.  \n\n   David Salem, Assistant U.S. Attorney, described the forfeiture\nas a ``hybrid adoption'' because federal agents were aware of the\npolice investigation but were not involved in the searches.  \n\n   Salem also said the forfeiture would be justified because\nCarroll didn't take enough steps to protect her property, even\nthough she says she evicted her children and changed a lock before\nproceedings began.  \n\n   ``She claims she changed a lock on a door though I'm unclear\nwhich door it is,'' Salem said. ``She claims she took steps that\neven if I would credit them as true, the government believes them\nto be insufficient to justify innocent ownership. There was no\neffect. That didn't keep the children out of the house.''  \n\n   {( Begin optional trim )}\n\n   It's no accident that many state laws have tougher forfeiture\nstandards than federal law, legislators say.  \n\n   ``We have tried to make sure that people who are subject to\nforfeitures have some basic rights,'' said Georgia Rep.

The officer found $611,500 in a hidden compartment.\nA dog signaled the presence of drug residue on the cash.  \n\n   To forfeit the money under state law, police usually need a\nfelony conviction.  \n\n   But police found no drugs and sent the driver on his way.  \n\n   Soon after, the department gave the money to a federal agent.  \n\n   ``The reality is there are situations under which California law\nwill not permit forfeiture, and federal law will,'' said Andy\nCuellar, a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, Calif.  \n\n   ``There is very little California can do about it.''  \n\n   An Alaska case shows just how strong federal powers are.  \n\n   Fairbanks police had seized $44,850 in cash from Perry Johnson\nafter finding cocaine in his home.
