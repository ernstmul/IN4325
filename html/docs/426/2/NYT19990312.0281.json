Even the peppers' pungent smell couldn't fool\nthe drug-sniffing dog brought in by police.\n\n   On Thursday, the Missouri Highway Patrol announced what might be\nthe largest seizure of marijuana in the state's history, more than\n6,500 pounds taken from a tractor-trailer near Springfield. The\nmarijuana has a street value of about $7.5 million.\n\n   Missouri Highway Patrol Lt. Chris Ricks said officials at a\nstate weigh station along Interstate 44 in Strafford became\nsuspicious of a tractorload Wednesday evening and called in Highway\nPatrol officers, who brought a drug-sniffing dog along.\n\n   ``During routine questioning about the load, the driver wasn't\nable to tell the weigh station officials exactly what his load\ncontained,'' Ricks said. ``He also said he wasn't exactly sure\nwhere he was taking the load. On top of that, his paperwork wasn't\nin order. Normally, a truckdriver has this type of information in\norder. When he doesn't, it's a good sign that further inspection\nmight be needed.''\n\n   Police have arrested Abbas Amir Shambayaty, 28, an Iranian\nnational, and charged him with one count of possession with intent\nto distribute marijuana. He was ordered held without bond pending a\nhearing March 22. He faces up to 10 years to life in prison without\nparole and $4 million in fines if convicted.\n\n   Ricks said: ``A lot of times, smugglers think the smell of red\npeppers or onions will throw off police. And if you or I stepped\ninto the back of that trailer, the smell would probably be\noverpowering.\n\n   ``But the dog, he hit on the marijuana immediately.''\n\n   Apparently, the driver had picked the load up somewhere in Texas\nand was en route to the Chicago area, Ricks said. Once there, the\ndriver was supposed to make a phone call for instructions.\n\n   Ricks said the driver has been turned over to the U.S. State\nDepartment because he's a foreign national. Next, the patrol will\ninvestigate the source of the drugs and their destination.\n\n   ``The driver usually isn't the person we want the most anyway,''\nhe said. ``He's usually just some poor guy who's made a very bad\ndecision on how to make a living.\n\n   Ricks added that a check of records indicated this was the\nbiggest marijuana seizure in Missouri's history.\n\n   The arrest marked the second time in a month that authorities\nhave seized a huge load of marijuana at the Interstate 44 station\nnear Strafford. About 5,700 pounds was found in a truck there two\nweeks ago.\n","Headline":"\nDOG SNIFFS OUT MARIJUANA HIDDEN IN TRUCK FILLED WITH PEPPERS \n","Text":["\n   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Turns out red chili peppers weren't the\nhottest item inside the big rig authorities stopped in southern\nMissouri earlier this week.\n","\n   That honor would go to the 3 tons of marijuana hidden among\nboxes of red peppers.
