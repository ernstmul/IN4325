Fainberg said that the goal was to have\ndetectors at every terminal.\n\n   Part of the reason for using this technology, he said, is that\nexplosives do not always show up on X-ray machines. He added that\nwhile the FAA did still sometimes use dogs, the animals needed\nfrequent breaks, were not efficient in checking a large volume of\npassengers and were considered by some to be intrusive.\n\n   So far, the FAA has yet to find any actual bombs using the\ndetectors, said Rebecca Trexler, a spokeswoman for the agency.\nRather, she said the technology serves as a deterrent and is in\nplace just in case someone does try to smuggle explosives aboard a\nplane.\n\n   Other agencies like the Customs Service and the Coast Guard also\nuse particle detectors. But unlike the FAA agents, they search for\ndrugs as well as explosives, often by wiping steering wheels,\ntravel documents and door handles.\n\n   Customs has had some modest success in detecting drugs with the\ntechnology, according to Robert Armstrong, the agency's director of\nresearch and development. However, he said that inspectors have yet\nto find a bomb using a detector.\n\n   Of course, no technology can guarantee that contraband will be\nfound discovered every time, Armstrong said. Smugglers often try to\ncircumvent detection, he said, by wearing rubber gloves, packing\ndrugs in plastic, and not letting the person who carries the load\never touch it directly.\n\n   ``Nothing is 100 percent,'' he said, and added that efforts at\nevasion like wrapping illegal substances in thick plastic wrap\ncould make smugglers more vulnerable to other technologies, like\nx-rays or send them searching for other routes.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nELECTRONIC DOGS GUARD AIRPORTS \n","Text":["\n   It does not bark, wag its tail or scratch when sniffing for\ndrugs and explosives at the nation's airports and border crossings.\nRather, this device flashes a red light when it has detected\ncontraband and, on a display screen, tells what kind.\n","\n   Call them electronic dogs.
