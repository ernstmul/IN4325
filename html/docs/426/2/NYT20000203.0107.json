We're staying alert.''\n\n   The State Police are bringing troopers from other areas of the\nNew York to beef up patrols during the four-day event, which begins\nFeb. 17.\n\n   In addition, FBI and State Police SWAT teams will be stationed\nat a command post near the village outskirts. A counterterrorism\nFBI unit in Washington, D.C., has been tracking any potential\nthreats to the Goodwill Games.\n\n   ``That threat assessment will continue right through the\ngames,'' Warburton said.\n\n   Louie F. Allen, special agent in charge of the FBI's Albany\nfield office, said the FBI has worked at previous Goodwill Games.\nThis is the first Winter Goodwill Games.\n\n   ``From the beginning we were going to be there because we\nclassify that as an FBI special event because a number of people\nare going to be there from outside the country,'' Allen said.\n\n   At Canadian-border entry points, U.S. Customs agents already are\non alert. Much of the agents' work will be to get athletes across\nthe border swiftly, said Tim Meshinelli, assistant port director\nfor U.S. Customs in Champlain.\n\n   As they did for the 1980 Olympic Winter Games here, numerous\nathletes and spectators are expected to drive into Lake Placid from\nCanada. A biathlete bringing a high-powered rifle across the border\nfor a competition might normally result in a bureaucratic delay.\nBut Meshinelli said agents have reviewed applicable tariff laws so\nathletes with proper credentials will be processed quickly at the\nborder.\n\n   ``As far as the security end of it, our people have been\nbriefed,'' Meshinelli said. ``They are aware and certainly are in\nthat (high-security) mode based on what they've been through.''\n\n   Border security was heightened two months ago amid concerns\nabout terrorism tied to New Year's celebrations. The alert followed\nthe Dec. 19 arrest of a Canadian woman and an Algerian man at a\nVermont border crossing. The two were driving a car that\nbomb-sniffing dogs indicated may have once carried explosives, and\nthe woman, Lucia Garofalo, has been linked to what federal\nprosecutors have described as a terrorist group operating in Europe\nand Algeria.\n\n   For the games, several U.S. Border Patrol agents will be in Lake\nPlacid. Agents also will be deployed at isolated locations along\nthe border.\n\n   ``It would be logical to assume they increase security at the\npoints of entry,'' said Border Patrol Assistant Chief Mark Henry.\n``It would also be logical to assume (any terrorists) are not going\nto come through points of entry, but through the woods. ... We\nbelieve we're prepared.''\n","Headline":"\n      SECURITY FORCES ON ALERT FOR WINTER GAMES \n","Text":["\n   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Security along the Canadian border is being\ntightened as police and counterterrorism SWAT teams move into Lake\nPlacid for the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games.\n","\n   The authorities said the heightened law enforcement presence is\nprecautionary because thousands of spectators and more than 500\nathletes from around the world will arrive in the Olympic village\nstarting next week.\n","\n   ``There is no perceptible (terrorist) threat to the Goodwill\nGames yet, which isn't to say that one may not arise,'' said Maj.\nWilliam Warburton of the New York State Police. ``But we've planned\nfor all kinds of security contingencies. ...
