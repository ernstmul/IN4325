Her computer told her it wasn't\nhis car. Then a drug dog caught a scent.\n\n   Bland yanked up the back seat. Instead of a foam cushion, there\nwere bricks of pot. Compartments under the carpet and in back of\nthe seat held more stashes.\n\n   Flipping out a pocketknife, Bland dug into an oil-coated brick\nand ran the blade slowly under his nose. ``Positive!'' he said,\ngrinning.\n\n   Border warriors treat drug catches like game fish. Bland's,\nsnagged one morning last spring, weighed in at 67 pounds.\n\n   Often, it's the instincts of people such as Tellez and Bland,\nplus basic, good detective work, that deliver the best payoffs.\n\n   These days, it takes technology as well.\n\n   The swarms of agents deployed along the border are equipped with\nenough gizmos to embarrass the Pentagon.\n\n   They roam southern Arizona wearing a new generation of\nnight-vision gear that turns night into day. Ground sensors and\nlive, low-light cameras planted along the border tell them when and\nwhere people are moving.\n\n   Infrared night scopes are posted on hills, letting agents spy on\nseveral square miles of desert in the dead of night while staring\nat consoles in their truck cabs.\n\n   A remote-controlled drone with a videocamera patrols\nsoutheastern Arizona and western New Mexico from the sky, hunting\nfor traffickers while an operator in a trailer miles away watches\nthe images on a screen.\n\n   Sophisticated new radio equipment allows the many federal, state\nand local law enforcement agencies chasing drugs to speak to each\nother on a common frequency. Encryption gear keeps traffickers from\nintercepting radio chatter.\n\n   Vapor-tracing machines detect the presence of minute particles\nof drugs or explosives at ports of entry.\n\n   Last year, the Customs Service spent $130 million for new\ndope-finding gear. A fair share of it is going into Arizona's busy\nports.\n\n   Two things explain the evolution. The North American Free Trade\nAgreement boosted traffic at major ports along the Southwestern\nborder. At the same time, the buildup of Border Patrol agents\nbetween ports made smuggling through the ports themselves more\nattractive.   \nNEW ENFORCEMENT TOOLS\n\n   The U.S. Customs Service responded with Operation Hardline,\nputting new tactics and gadgets into use at border ports. The idea\nwas to improve inspections and make them faster at a time when tons\nof narcotics were moving through America's ports because smuggling\nseams elsewhere were being zipped up.\n\n   In Nogales, semi rigs line up two-by-two, deep into Mexico,\nrunning a gantlet of inspection points. Inspectors swipe hand-held\ndensity readers along trailers, looking for drug hollows as the\nrigs roll by.\n\n   Trucks pass through a drug screening building under a catwalk\nthat provides a bird's-eye view. Eventually, undercarriage cameras\nwill film the chassis. New databases track every vehicle's crossing\nhistory, ownership and cargo manifest.\n\n   If inspectors see something awry or get a hunch, trucks are\nunloaded, drilled, tapped and X-rayed. Up to 80 a day get pulled\nthrough a long metal shed that looks like a carwash. Inside, a $3\nmillion scanner sends X-ray images to four video screens.\n\n   Recently, a $1 million mobile gamma ray scanner also was\ninstalled to pass over 150 to 200 trucks daily as they roll into\nArizona. Another is planned over railroad tracks crossing the\nborder into downtown Nogales.\n\n   Michael Lovejoy, Customs' anti-smuggling director, says the\n``non-intrusive'' inspection technology means that vehicles aren't\nbeing ripped apart by inspectors as often and that traffic lines\nare speeding up.\n\n   Marijuana and cocaine seizures are also on the rise. In 1995,\nthere were 54 seizures using imaging equipment. In 1998, there were\nnearly five times that many.\n\n   It's still a drop in the bucket. At most, only two in five rigs\nrolling through Nogales are fully scanned for drugs, even with the\nnew gear in place. Many inspectors say that high-tech gear is nice\nbut that human eyes and instinct still make the difference.\n\n   ``A lot of your good inspectors out on the line, they live for\nthat seizure,'' said Jimmy Tong Jr., Douglas' port director. ``The\nbig payoff is just sheer experience and determination.''   \nDETAILS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n   For the most part, the job is monotonous. Eight hours on your\nfeet. Freezing nights in January. Murderous afternoons in August.\nPerpetual auto exhaust.\n\n   Inspectors watch drivers' nervous twitches or odd looks. Using\nmirrors, mallets and electronic scopes, they poke and prod cars to\ncheck for fresh paint, suspicious bulges, new welds, missing\nscrews.\n\n   They scour immigrant documents, scan computerized crossing\nhistories and study regular crossers for unusual patterns.\n\n   The watchers rotate every hour or so, moving from primary\ninspection booths to secondary stations to the pedestrian lines.\nSome teams are made up entirely of rovers. They stay on the move\nthroughout the port, so smugglers never know how to avoid them or\nwhich lanes are safe.\n\n   ``There's nobody who knows where we're going to be or when,''\nsays Rick Gill, head of the Mobile Port Enforcement Team in\nNogales.\n\n   Sometimes, a blitz is called, and every lane in the port is\nstopped cold. Nobody is waved on. Drug-sniffing dogs dash in and\nout of the traffic jam, noses alert for drugs on the move.\n\n   In southbound lanes, teams of inspectors eyeball pedestrians and\ntraffic for contraband _ mostly stolen cars, drug money and guns _\nheading to Mexico. Portable X-ray machines scan suspicious luggage.\nThe inspectors once found $102,000 inside a brand new stereo that a\nman was taking into Mexico.\n\n   During a four-month period last winter, the Nogales southbound\nteam nabbed more than $500,000 heading into Mexico.   \nNO SUCH THING AS AVERAGE\n\n   The inspector's job demands vigilance. It's impossible to\nanticipate the next load. It's just as impossible to categorize the\naverage smuggler.\n\n   Few would have suspected the old Datsun carrying a Mexican man\nand his two daughters through the Nogales port one evening last\nspring. With a doll in a pink dress perched in its back window, the\ncar looked every bit like it was taking an average family to visit\nrelatives.\n\n   Yet Inspector John Landers had a hunch. The driver's hands shook\nslightly, and the 12-year-old girl was sprawled across the back\nseat, taking up as much space as possible.\n\n   Landers leaned inside to feel the seat. He got a whiff of\nsweet-scented soap. The seat was rock-hard. Underneath were 24\npackages of pot wrapped crudely in cellophane, mustard and soap\nshavings.\n\n   ``The question we get is, `Do I look like a coker?' '' Douglas\nInspector Nicholas Castillo said. ``We don't answer that. Cokers\nlook young, old, female, male, Hispanic, Anglo.''\n\n   They look like everyone.   \n  \n","Headline":"\nSMUGGLERS OFTEN BETRAY THEMSELVES \n","Text":["\n     \n(PHOENIX) - Patting down a driver at the Nogales port of entry,\nthis is what Inspector Paul Bland noticed most: The guy's heart was\npounding out of his chest, and he was sweating like crazy.\n","\n   There were other signs as well.\n","\n   Brenda Tellez, another U.S. Customs inspector, had noticed the\ndriver's nervous tics when he pulled his maroon Volkswagen Golf\ninto her lane at the port of entry.
