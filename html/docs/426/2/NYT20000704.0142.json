{"DocumentId":"NYT20000704.0142","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"2","Body":" BC-WORKING-DOGS-NYT \nCOMMENTARY: SOME DOGS ARE PROFESSIONALS \n\n   By FRED BROCK   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I\ntried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living.\nCanines that can hold their heads high as they approach their\nsupper dishes. Animals whose vet bills could be a tax-deductible\nexpense for their owners.\n\n   My dogs yawned as their attention drifted to a chattering\nsquirrel. They gave me their how-long-until-we-are-fed look and\nwandered deeper into the backyard.\n\n   I sighed and returned to my growing list of what working-class\ndogs do for a living. I was helped by a new book, ``Dogs With Jobs:\nWorking Dogs Around the World,'' by Merrily Weisbord and Kim\nKachanoff (Pocket Books, $24.95). The possibilities are impressive.\nThere are dogs that work as actors and guards; there are dogs that\naid the blind, the deaf and the ill. There are dogs that work for\nthe police sniffing out drugs, bombs and missing bodies. Then there\nare racing dogs, rescue dogs and show dogs. There are dogs that\nherd cattle and sheep, and dogs that serve as companions for\npatients in nursing homes and hospitals.\n\n   Of course, most dogs do duty as family pets, and that role\nshould not be made light of. These stalwarts provide love and\nsecurity to tens of millions of Americans.\n\n   But I wanted to check out some working dogs _ dogs with real\njobs, that work each day in a particular place with a particular\ngoal. I was interested in canines that, if they had two legs\ninstead of four, would be entitled to the minimum wage. Dogs like\nSmokey, who works as a fire department mascot and guard dog in\nPaterson, N.J.; Pearl, who herds cattle in New Mexico; Royce, who\nsniffs out illegal drugs for the sheriff's department in Essex\nCounty, N.J.; and Moki, who works as a companion to residents of a\nnursing home in California.\n\n   BEATING THE FLAMES\n\n   The firefighters at the Northside Firehouse on Temple Street in\nPaterson, N.J., call Smokey, a friendly 9-year-old mixed breed who\nlooks mostly like a German shepherd, a ``Paterson street dog.'' But\nit's a compliment to his street smarts, not a slur on his lineage.\n\n   Smokey has lived and worked at the firehouse since he was a\npuppy and two firefighters brought him there from an animal shelter\nin Newark.\n\n   Dave Coughlan, a Paterson firefighter who usually watches after\nSmokey, says the dog doesn't go on as many fire calls as he did\nwhen he was younger.\n\n   ``We watch him a little more carefully now,'' he said. ``We\ndon't want him to get hurt.''\n\n   But that hasn't stopped Smokey from working: When he's not on a\nfire call, he stays behind and guards the firehouse until the\nfirefighters return.\n\n   ``He's had his share of battle wounds _ stitches for cuts from\nbroken glass and stuff like that,'' Coughlan said.\n\n   When Smokey goes to a fire, he often beats the firefighters\ninside a burning building.\n\n   ``He's looking for people and pets,'' Coughlan said. ``Many\ntimes he's beaten me into a building and then come out choking\nwhile I'm still getting my gear on. Later, he'll check to make sure\nwe're all safe.''\n\n   Coughlan sometimes takes Smokey to his house for a visit. ``But\nafter a few hours, he wants to get back to the firehouse,''\nCoughlan said. ``It's his home.''\n\n   ROUNDING UP CATTLE\n\n   Wherever John Gard goes, Pearl is usually right by his side. Or,\nmore precisely, by the side of his cattle.\n\n   Pearl, a 10-year-old bluish-black-and-white Scottish border\ncollie, helps Gard, who is 80, run cattle on 9,000 acres near\nGladstone, in northeastern New Mexico.\n\n   Whether Gard is working from the back of a horse or behind the\nwheel of a truck, Pearl stays busy helping him round up stray\ncattle and move herds into corrals or from pasture to pasture.\n\n   ``She's a big help,'' Gard said. ``She really works.''\n\n   Gard got Pearl when she was a puppy and trained her himself.\n\n   ``Pearl and border collies like her are only happy when they're\nworking,'' he said. ``They want to work, and they learn easily.''\n\n   He said that like many border collies, Pearl is a master of\ngetting cattle to do her bidding without hurting them. ``These dogs\nare best for working cattle, I think,'' he said. ``They mainly snap\nat the heels, just enough to scare the cattle.''\n\n   For many years, Gard has used border collies on his ranch and\ncan't imagine being without one. ``Pearl takes care of me,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   DETECTING THE DRUGS\n\n   Gabe Rispoli, a detective with the canine unit of the Essex\nCounty sheriff's department, had carefully hidden two plastic bags\nof cocaine and marijuana in an abandoned building next to his\nunit's offices in Belleville, N.J. Then, when detective Chris\nDi-Rocco gave the command, Royce _ a 3-year-old black mixed\nLabrador and retriever _ bounded into action. Within seconds he had\nfound the first stash in a discarded file cabinet; with equal\ndispatch he found the second in the drawer of a old desk. In both\ncases he signaled his discovery by frantically pawing at the hiding\nplaces.\n\n   Royce is a specialist in sniffing out narcotics. He is one of\nthree dogs used for that purpose by the canine unit. Ten other dogs\nof various breeds, including bloodhounds and German shepherds, are\nused to find bombs, detect arson, track suspects or missing people,\nor help in search-and-rescue operations.\n\n   Royce came to the sheriff's department from Morristown, N.J.,\nafter the Seeing Eye Inc., which trains guide dogs, rejected him\nbecause of a short attention span. But this characteristic made him\nperfect for rapid police searches.\n\n   ``Royce is an amazing dog,'' said DiRocco, who is the dog's\nhuman partner and takes him home when the two aren't on duty. ``He\nloves to work and he loves to play. And he knows the difference.''\n\n   SPURRING THE SMILES\n\n   Moki is on duty 24 hours a day at the Vista Del Sol Care Center,\na nursing home in Culver City, Calif. During rounds each morning,\nhe visits patients; later, he meets them in an exercise room.\n\n   Moki, who is 1 year old, is a black and white peekapoo, a cross\nbetween a Pekingese and a miniature poodle.\n\n   Stella Henry, a nurse who is a co-founder and director of the\nnursing home, says Moki has had an extremely positive effect on the\npatients. She cites examples of usually unresponsive patients who\nhave reacted to Moki by petting him and talking to him.\n\n   She says attendance and laughter at activities programs increase\nas Moki ``works the room'' and ``earns his keep.''\n\n   ``Moki sees no age, no wrinkles, no tremors and no tubes,'' she\nadded. ``His expertise lies in giving unconditional love.''\n","Headline":"\nCOMMENTARY: SOME DOGS ARE PROFESSIONALS \n","Text":["\n   My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I\ntried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living.\nCanines that can hold their heads high as they approach their\nsupper dishes.
