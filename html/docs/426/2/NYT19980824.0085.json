Originally filed on Saturday, August (ATTN: N.C., Utah)  \n IN A SUMMER OF SEARCHES, A RETURN TO LOW TECH  \n(The Week in Review) \n(lb) \n By TIMOTHY EGAN   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   For much of the summer, hundreds of searchers dressed in\ncamouflage and armed with tracking devices that detect the\nslightest motion of warm-blooded bipeds have been scouring the\nwoods of North Carolina and the slick-rock canyons of Utah looking\nfor three of the United States' most-wanted fugitives.\n\n   They have used helicopters, night-vision scopes, heat sensors,\nmotion detectors, smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers, small\nplanes and radios with encrypted transmissions _ all for naught.\n\n   The technology may be James Bondian. But what the searchers\nreally need, says one frustrated sheriff, is a snitch and a good\nbloodhound.\n\n   The searches are among the biggest ever mounted, authorities\nsay, and they have relied heavily on technology and gadgetry that\nmake the manhunts in movies like ``Cool Hand Luke'' seem quaint.\n\n   ``These motion detectors, they're largely worthless as near as I\ncan tell,'' said Sheriff Mike Lacy, of San Juan County, Utah, where\na dragnet has been used in an attempt to find two men suspected of\nkilling a police officer and wounding three others. ``You pick up\nsomething and you can't tell if it's a cow or a deer or a dog or a\nman.''\n\n   At one point, nearly 500 people were involved in the search for\nAlan Pilon and Jason McVean, the fugitives who vanished into the\nred rock country of the Southwest in late May. But the search party\ndwindled to a few sheriff's officers and amateur bounty hunters who\nkeep bumping into the deputies.\n\n   In the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, an army of more\nthan 200 people were engaged at the height of the hunt for Eric\nRudolph, who has been charged with the death of a security guard in\nthe bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.\n\n   Rudolph, a white separatist, had disappeared into the woods\nshortly after the bombing on Jan. 29. He is also wanted for\nquestioning about three bombings in Georgia, including one during\nthe 1996 Olympic Games.\n\n   As the North Carolina task force dwindled, that search became\nentangled with freelance bounty hunters and volunteers _ notably\nJames ``Bo'' Gritz, the former Green Beret colonel who makes his\nliving selling survivalist gear and railing on his radio talk show\nabout millennial conspiracies. On Friday, even Gritz gave up and\nordered his troops to prepare to break up their paramilitary camp\nnear Andrews, N.C.\n\n   Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the Nantahala National\nForest, south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He has a\n$1 million bounty on his head.\n\n   Bloodhounds are still used. But heat has been a hindrance to the\ndogs, particularly in the arid West. The hot weather _ in Utah,\ntemperatures have reached 106 degrees _ has also hobbled some of\nthe heat-seeking devices.\n\n   ``If you don't have people giving you tips, or you don't do\nbasic police work, it can get pretty tough to find a guy,'' said\nCapt. Terry Blue of the Montgomery County sheriff's office in North\nCarolina.\n\n   Earlier this summer, officers from Blue's small office nabbed a\nfugitive who was wanted in the killings of two campers. The\nsuspect, James A. Finley Jr., had bragged to friends that he could\nelude authorities as well as Rudolph. But after a six-day search,\nhe was caught by men on foot, with dogs.\n\n   Members of the search party had done their homework, reasoning\nthat Finley might return to an old hunting hideout he had used\nbefore. They also had a tip from a person who reported him trying\nto enter a cabin.\n\n   ``He came running right to where we were waiting,'' said Blue.\n``But we had everybody helping us. You've got a little different\nmind-set up there with Rudolph. A lot of people aren't so eager to\nturn him in.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   T-shirts that say ``Run Rudolph Run'' have sold not far from the\nsearch base for Rudolph.\n\n   A 31-year-old carpenter with survivalist skills, Rudolph has\nleft money behind after stealing groceries, and is said to have a\npolite demeanor _ endearing qualities to some in the Appalachians\nwho resent the show of force by state and federal law-enforcement\nofficers.\n\n   Rudolph is a ninth-grade dropout who is on the FBI's 10\nmost-wanted list.\n\n   For a long time, the search has centered on a relatively small\n30-square-mile area in the mountains. But it is a thicket of\nrhododendrons and hardwood brush, with plenty of caves and hollows\nin which to hide.\n\n   By contrast, the Utah search has centered on 5,600 square miles\nof public land _ an area bigger than the state of Connecticut _\nthat contains part of the Navajo Indian Reservation, the canyons\naround Lake Powell, the expanse of Monument Valley, the high\nreaches of the Henry Mountains and two areas whose names say it\nall: the Dark Canyon Primitive Area and the Grand Gulch Primitive\nArea.\n\n   ``I could go hide out there now and nobody could ever find me,''\nsaid Lacy, whose office is leading the search. ``There's plenty of\nwater, and food and old mine shafts to hide in if you know what\nyou're doing.''\n\n   Despite the aid of the National Guard and the array of\ntechnology, the Utah search is back to square one, with few\nsubstantial leads, said the sheriff.\n\n   ``We're down to trying to do the leg work and following up on\ntips,'' Lacy said. ``One day we'll catch them, or find them dead.\nCould be a long time, though.''\n","Headline":"\n22.)\n","Text":["\n   For much of the summer, hundreds of searchers dressed in\ncamouflage and armed with tracking devices that detect the\nslightest motion of warm-blooded bipeds have been scouring the\nwoods of North Carolina and the slick-rock canyons of Utah looking\nfor three of the United States' most-wanted fugitives.\n","\n   They have used helicopters, night-vision scopes, heat sensors,\nmotion detectors, smoke bombs, armored personnel carriers, small\nplanes and radios with encrypted transmissions _ all for naught.\n","\n   The technology may be James Bondian.
