Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The Mets needed this miracle.\n\n   Silly as it may sound on one night of a 162-game season, the\nMets made a major claim on posterity.\n\n   The Mets were down, 8-1, going into the bottom of the eighth\ninning Friday night at Shea Stadium. The Braves were on the verge\nof taking the Mets' heart. They had already trounced them on\nThursday, and now they were moving in for the kill. Atlanta\nmanhandled Mike Hampton, the multimillion-dollar pitcher whose sole\npurpose in baseball life was to carry the Mets over the top. Melvin\nMora, the rock-solid everything player, made an error Friday night\nand Mike Piazza made his second in three days.\n\n   More than that, Atlanta was toying with the Mets. The Atlanta\nplayers were on the bench laughing and guffawing, sitting on the\ntop step of the dugout, backs turned to the Mets as if the game\nwere over.\n\n   Then came the eighth inning, when the Mets loaded the bases with\ntwo out. In a fitting turnabout for a team that was eliminated from\nthe National League Championship Series by Atlanta on a\nbases-loaded walk, the Mets scored three runs on three consecutive\nwalks. They tied the game, 8-8, on a two-run single by Edgardo\nAlfonzo and then finally won it on a three-run homer by Piazza.\n\n   Friday night's victory did so much to cut through a depressing\nfunk that was enveloping this franchise.\n\n   Earlier in the day, a man wearing a jacket and a badge\napproached me and asked how he might get the key to Wilpon's suite\nand Doubleday's suite. Two other men were holding a pair of dogs by\nleashes. The man with the jacket and badge explained that they were\npart of the New York City Police Department's bomb detail. ``We\nhave to sweep Wilpon's suite, but we need the key.''\n\n   Why he was asking me how to get the key, I had no idea, but\nsearching for bombs in the suites of the Mets' co-owners was\nunsettling. With walkie-talkies, the police officers left with the\ndogs to sweep other parts of Shea Stadium but said they would\nreturn.\n\n   Take me out to the ballgame.\n\n   Outside Shea, waves of New York City police officers lined up\nand received instructions for deployment inside the stadium.\n\n   All this because a 25-year-old Atlanta Braves relief pitcher\nnamed John Rocker pushed the limits of his constitutional right to\nfree speech.\n\n   The dogs went sniffing and the police officers went to their\nposts.\n\n   This was Day 2 of a four-game Atlanta-Mets series. But the men\nwith blue coats and badges and dogs created an atmosphere that\nintruded on the hallowed space of a baseball game.\n\n   Earlier in the day Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, finished\nhis pre-game interview with reporters, looked around the stadium\nand shook his head. He said the Rocker affair made him feel\nuncomfortable.\n\n   ``I have a 17-year-old who just brought three friends up from\nTexas,'' he said. ``I gave them free rein, after he spent a month\nin the city, battling the subway when he's downtown, taking the No.\n7 coming out here, leaving when he wants to leave. Going to Times\nSquare, going to SoHo on his own, with his buddy.\n\n   ``Now their parents are in Texas going: `What's this idiot doing\nwith my kids? They took the train home from the game.' And just the\nfact that my wife had to say `Are you sure it's OK for them to do\nit?' bugs me.\n\n   ``Freedom is a wonderful thing,'' Valentine added. ``People say\nit's not free, but it definitely isn't for anyone to take away from\nanyone else.\n\n   ``I don't think this police state is what we're all about,''\nValentine said. ``I understand protecting the individual, but the\nguarded statements, closed clubhouses _ what is all that?''\n\n   Rocker made disparaging remarks about Valentine, New York City\nand its ethnic groups in a Sports Illustrated article six months\nago. ``I almost think he was saying what he thought was cool,\ntaking that persona when he runs out of that bullpen, what I think\nof as a WWF mentality.`\n\n   Baseball has apparently cautioned the Mets and the Braves to\nwatch what they say.\n\n   ``We're held to a higher standard than everyone else,''\nValentine said. ``Our sport and the rest of society are going in\ndifferent directions. We're under more restrictions as the rest of\nsociety becomes more free. What is that? I feel resentment of the\nfact that I do feel restrained.''  \n\n   There was something unsettling about all the police, the\nbomb-sniffing dogs, the layers of cameras. The scene was\ndepressing.
