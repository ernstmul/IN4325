It's a photograph familiar to most people who\nhave picked up a newspaper or watched a TV news program during the\nlast couple of weeks.\n\n   ``I took off my glasses so the deputy could get a better look\nand I said, `It's not me,''' said Bermea, a 35-year-old Mexican\nnative who lives in Houston but often drives his pest control truck\nto outlying towns for work. ``She laughed and drove away.''\n\n   ``I understand,'' said Bermea, who also is local coordinator of\nthe Association for Residency and Citizenship of America. ``They're\ndoing their job.''\n\n   Others are not so understanding.\n\n   Resendez-Ramirez, a Mexican national linked to at least eight\nslayings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas, is on the FBI's Ten Most\nWanted list. As the manhunt grows, some Hispanics are complaining\nthat any man ``who looks like a Mexican'' is considered a suspect.\n\n   ``We as Hispanics are stereotyped anyway,'' said Maria Jimenez,\nlocal director of another immigrants' rights group, the American\nFriends Service Committee. ``So with thousands of calls coming from\nall over the country, law enforcement and others need to be\ncautious while engaging in a search. They need to make sure they're\nindividualizing their search instead of generalizing a whole\npopulation.''\n\n   Fernando Garcia, coordinator in El Paso of the Immigration Law\nEnforcement Project, said the phenomenon is most intense along the\nborder.\n\n   ``The climate is that the sheriff's deputies and Border Patrol\nare stopping almost everyone if they look like a Mexican,'' Garcia\nsaid. ``People are getting arrested for just walking on the\n(railroad) tracks. It's getting out of hand.''\n\n   Garcia fears the search for Resendez-Ramirez could hurt Hispanic\nimmigrants in the long run.\n\n   ``Here on the border, it's almost normal to be detained,'' he\nsaid. ``But we are worried that the government will use this for\npolitical gains to make tougher immigration laws or argue again for\ntroops on the border.''\n\n   A Marine Corp patrol, deployed during an anti-drug surveillance\noperation in 1997, shot and killed an 18-year-old goat herder in\nWest Texas. The use of Marines on anti-drug operations along the\nborder was later suspended, and the troops were withdrawn.\n\n   Immigration and law enforcement officials say they are being\ncareful to protect the rights of innocent people. But they vow an\naggressive search, noting that the suspect is accused of\nparticularly vicious crimes.\n\n   Union Pacific Railroad Co. police are teaming up with the FBI,\nthe U.S. Border Patrol and other law enforcement agencies in the\nsearch for Resendez-Ramirez. The victims were all killed in homes\nnear railroad tracks, and the suspect is believed to travel the\ncountry by hopping on and off freight trains. Most of the victims\nwere bludgeoned to death, and most of the women were sexually\nassaulted. Fingerprints and other physical evidence point to\nResendez-Ramirez, police say.\n\n   Union Pacific police are inspecting trains and yards along\nroutes in 23 states, looking for people who illegally ride the\nrails. They are stopping trains whenever they get a tip, said\ncompany spokesman John Bromley.\n\n   ``We stop an average of 10 to 12 trains a day,'' Bromley said\nfrom Union Pacific's Omaha, Neb., headquarters. ``We have had 14\nsuch incidents in the last 24 hours on reports of trespassers on\nthe yard or rail.''\n\n   In most cases, agents walk alongside the trains with dogs\nsniffing each car. If a dog signals that something is wrong, the\nagents will open a car and search it.\n\n   Union Pacific police removed about 97,000 trespassers from rail\nproperty last year, Bromley said. Half of those were illegal\nimmigrants, he said, mostly Hispanic males.\n\n   ``We had a zero tolerance for trespassers even before this\nsearch,'' he said. ``But before, we would just order them to leave\nthe property. Now we're taking more time to identify them.''\n\n   Railroad police for Fort Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern\nSanta Fe Corp. also are working with the Border Patrol to search\ntrains. Spokesman Richard Russack said the FBI has requested that\ncompany to remain on the lookout for the suspect.\n\n   In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss said there were no new\ndevelopments in the case, adding that the multi-agency task force\nsearching for Resendez-Ramirez continues to follow up on some of\nthe many leads it receives each day.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nSOME HISPANICS COMPLAIN THAT MANHUNT FOCUSING ON ANY MAN `WHO LOOKS\nLIKE A MEXICAN' \n \n\n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ Exterminator Francisco Bermea was on a recent call\nwhen he noticed a sheriff's patrol car drive slowly by.\n","\n   The deputy had a wanted flier in her hands and was comparing\nBermea's face to the photo of accused serial killer Rafael\nResendez-Ramirez.
