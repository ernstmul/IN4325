Times News Service   \n\n   SAN DIEGO _ From a hillside overlooking the border with Mexico,\nyou can see the many obstacles that illegal aliens and drug\nsmugglers must navigate to enter the United States. There is a\nsteel fence cutting across miles of scrub, stadium lights that\nilluminate the night and hundreds of government agents posted in\nvans and inspection booths.\n\n   But increasingly, the border is being fortified with yet another\nline of defense that even the fastest sprinter may have trouble\neluding. Whether using stealth or crossing legally by car, citizens\nand noncitizens alike must now overcome a barrier of computer\nchips, copper wires, video monitors and camera lenses.\n\n   To bolster its effort to stop lawbreakers from entering the\ncountry and to speed along the law-abiding, who sometimes wait for\nhours to cross the border with a truck or car, the government is\nenlisting the help of technology. Within the first moments of\nentering the United States, most travelers become the focus of\nelectronic scrutiny.\n\n   ``We are clearly coming into the 20th century just in time,''\nsaid Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service.\n\n   Nowhere is that more true than here in San Diego, where\nthousands of people cross the border, legally and illegally, each\nday. The federal agencies that oversee the frontier have installed\nan array of gadgets that can, for example, find hidden compartments\nwhere drugs may be stashed, scan license plates to see if a car is\nstolen and help law enforcement agents see people concealed in the\nbushes.\n\n   The investment in border technology is part of a larger effort\nto control the nation's frontier with an infusion of personnel,\nfences and aircraft. While critics say that the buildup has merely\nshifted the stream of illegal traffic from urban areas like San\nDiego to more remote locations, officials say that they are gaining\nthe upper hand.\n\n   But some supporters of immigrants rights complain that\nelectronic deterrents are intrusive and not very neighborly. Some\nquestion whether it is necessary to ``militarize'' a border shared\nwith a friendly nation.\n\n   Among the most sophisticated systems on the border is one at the\nOtay Mesa crossing, a bustling port of entry on the outskirts of\nthis seaside city. Frequent commuters can avoid long car lines of\nup to two hours by using what is called an automated driving lane.\nIt is the difference between traveling first class and suffering in\nsteerage.\n\n   Cars in the program are equipped with transponders that emit a\nsort of radio fingerprint. As a car approaches the border, the\nlicense plate number, along with the names of the authorized\noccupants and their photographs, appear on a monitor inside the\ninspector's booth. Inspectors compare these images with the faces\ninside the cars to see if there are any impostors.\n\n   Leaning outside her booth into the car fumes on a recent\nafternoon, Christine Aranita, an INS inspector, found people who\nhad shaved their beards or gained weight, but nothing out of the\nordinary.\n\n   As drivers swiped an identity card through a machine, she asked\nif they had brought anything with them from Mexico and, when told\nno, wished them a good day. A few people chosen at random were\nreferred to the inspection area by the computer as a precaution\nagainst smuggling, but most quickly continued on their way.\n\n   ``In the other lanes, you have to check the immigration\ndocuments and make sure that they actually belong to them because\nwe have a lot of fraud,'' Ms. Aranita said. ``The good thing about\nthe automated lane is that they've already gone through a\nbackground check, so it's much faster. We already know who they\nare.''\n\n   The goal of the automatic lane is to allow inspectors to\ndispatch low-risk travelers quickly and spend more time with the\nothers. As it is, inspectors in the regular lanes typically spend\nless than a minute to question each person and examine the person's\ndocuments.\n\n   Olga Gomez, one of 3,300 people authorized to use the automated\nlane, was enthusiastic about the program. ``Waiting in line used to\nbe horrible'' when commuting between her home in San Diego and her\njob at a furniture factory in Tijuana, Mexico, she said. Now she\ncrosses the border in about 40 seconds and thinks nothing of the\n$129 annual fee to participate in the program.\n\n   ``Believe me, I pay that with a happy face,'' said Ms. Gomez,\nwho was having her fingerprints scanned by a computer in the port\noffice to renew her identity card.\n\n   Some remote ports of entry along the Canadian border use other\nkinds of technology that allow people to cross even after everyone\nwho works there has gone home for the day. At a crossing in Scobey,\nMont., for example, residents can speak into a microphone connected\nto a computer that analyzes their voices and lets those it\nrecognizes pass.\n\n   In the Northeast, there are several isolated border crossings\nwhere inspectors can work via video camera from dozens of miles\naway. Travelers must hold up their identity documents and sometimes\nopen their trunks for a camera so the images can be transmitted\nback to inspectors watching live on a television screen.\n\n   Cameras also play a role at Otay Mesa, where they scan the\nlicense plate number of every passing car so a computer can check\nit against those on a criminal lookout list. If the computer finds\na problem, it alerts the inspector with a loud beep.\n\n   nn\n\n   Keeping reliable files on illegal aliens, who often use\nfraudulent documents or carry no identification, is almost as easy.\nUsing digitized fingerprints, a computer system can determine\nwhether an alien has been caught before and is wanted by the\npolice.\n\n   A Mexican woman who identified herself as Patricia was looking\nespecially glum as an inspector entered her fingerprints and\ndigital photograph into the database for the first time. She had\ntried to fool inspectors by using someone else's United States\nbirth certificate and would now be deported and prohibited from\nlegally entering the country for five years.\n\n   ``Before it was like, `Do I know you?' '' said Rick Perez, an\nimmigration agency supervisor at Otay Mesa. ``Unless you recognized\nthe person, you would never know whether they had been apprehended\nbefore.''\n\n   It used to be difficult enough just to determine whether someone\ncrossing the border was carrying an authentic green card or\ncrossing document. But the agency has recently started phasing in\ncards that include holograms, magnetic stripes and digital\nphotographs, which make them more difficult to forge.\n\n   Layered defense is also the theme in inspecting trucks, which\nfor years have been used to smuggle everything from Cuban cigars to\ncocaine, from humans to puffer fish. If the sheer number of\ndifferent gadgets is any measure of official resolve to thwart\nillegality, truckers should beware.\n\n   ``We don't rely on any one piece of technology,'' said Ray\nMintz, director of applied technology for the United States Customs\nService, which oversees vehicle inspections. ``Every truck, every\ncar, every container that comes in the country will run the gamut\nof three or four different securities.''\n\n   Those include X-ray machines that are big enough to drive a\ntruck through and fiber optic cameras that look into hard-to-reach\nplaces like gas tanks. One instrument can determine whether the\nliquid inside a glass jar may contain dissolved drugs. Another,\nbuilt into a lane in El Paso, alerts inspectors when a passing\ntruck is carrying radioactive material and indicates whether it\nmight be in a nuclear bomb or medical waste.\n\n   Technologies like these are intended to make inspections faster\nand more thorough. Searching by hand would require dismantling\ntruck walls, rifling through tons of cargo and, in many cases,\ndestroying the contents because narcotics are often embedded in\nitems like plaster statues and toilet bowls.\n\n   Border authorities still use low-technology deterrents like dogs\nto look for hidden drugs and money. Though often successful at\ntheir job, dogs are somewhat limited in that they need frequent\nbreaks, are too small to get their noses into high places like\ntractor-trailer ceilings and are incapable of sniffing inside\nliquid-filled containers.\n\n   ``We're trying to force the smugglers to more complicated and\nexpensive methods that may make them more vulnerable,'' Mintz said.\n``I'm not trying to say that we will capture three times as much\ndrugs because, frankly, the smugglers will stop coming. They'll try\nsomewhere else.''\n\n   Indeed, faced with this ensemble of deterrents at the ports,\nmany would-be illegal immigrants and smugglers opt for what they\nbelieve is an easier road, through the ravines and pastures along\nthe border fence. But these dirt paths are not always as primitive\nas they may seem.\n\n   That was clear one night as Carlos Vaca, a Border Patrol agent,\nsat in his unmarked van on a hillside overlooking the frontier and\nlistened to a radio dispatcher announce the locations of buried\nground sensors that had detected movement.\n\n   Every few minutes, he maneuvered a thermal scope, which can see\nheat sources in the dark, in the direction of the sensor hits. All\nthat appeared in shades of green on his video monitor, though, was\na dog loping down a trail and a colleague's truck driving by.\n\n   Of course, technology has also been used against the government.\nAgents have found smugglers carrying night vision goggles and radio\nscanners that, before encryption technology, could monitor law\nenforcement radio traffic.\n\n   ``Clearly, we are going to have to stay one step ahead,'' said\nRon Collison, who heads the technology program for the INS. ``We're\nusing things that can be bought on the open market for the right\nprice.''\n\n   The enthusiasm for electronic deterrents is not held by\neveryone. Roberto Martinez, director of the border project of the\nAmerican Friends Service Committee, said that technologies like\ncameras and ground sensors were creating an ``increasingly\nmilitaristic frontier'' and ``making it more intrusive to U.S.\ncitizens and legal residents.''\n\n   Nearly everyone agrees that technology is not the only answer to\nprotecting the border. Though electronics are proving to be\nincreasingly effective, Demetrios G. Papademetriou, co-director of\nthe migration policy program for the Carnegie Endowment for\nInternational Peace, based in Washington, said that the equipment\nwas sometimes flawed and unequally distributed and had obviously\nyet to stop the thousands of illegal migrants and tons of drugs\nfrom flowing across the border each year.\n\n   ``Technology will help you, but it will not do the job for\nyou,'' Papademetriou said. ``You still need someone to go out and\npick up the illegal aliens and stop the smugglers.''\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nA SILICON WALL RISES ON THE BORDER \n","Text":["\n   SAN DIEGO _ From a hillside overlooking the border with Mexico,\nyou can see the many obstacles that illegal aliens and drug\nsmugglers must navigate to enter the United States.
