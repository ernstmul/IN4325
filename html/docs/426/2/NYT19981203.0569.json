It was unclear, he said, whether\nGurule injured himself on the prison's razor-wire fences or was\nshot by prison guards as he fled a week ago.\n\n   ``It was a long grueling seven days,'' spokesman Fitzgerald said\nof the manhunt that involved hundreds of law officers and dozens of\ntracking dogs. ``We believe it was the intense pressure put on by\nprison employees and other law enforcement agencies that indeed\nforced Gurule from his hiding place.''\n\n   The inmate's body was taken to the Huntsville Funeral Home and\nwas to be transferred to the University of Texas Medical Branch in\nGalveston for an autopsy. Fitzgerald said it could be several days\nbefore a cause of death is determined.\n\n   Gurule, who was facing the death penalty for killing two men\nduring a 1992 Corpus Christi robbery, was the only one of seven\ncondemned killers to succeed in escaping. After using a hacksaw\nblade to cut through the fence of a recreation yard just before\nmidnight on Thanksgiving, the group spent several hours on the roof\nof a prison building before sliding to the ground and running for\nthe fences before dawn last Friday.\n\n   Fitzgerald said Gurule, the first Texas inmate to flee death row\nsince 1934, had strapped cardboard around his body, under his\nprison clothing, to protect him from the razor wire that tops the\ntwo 10-foot chainlink fences he scaled before disappearing into the\nfoggy woods.\n\n   The other six would-be escapees surrendered when guards began\nshooting. None was injured.\n\n   Authorities had launched a massive, round-the-clock search for\nGurule, but tracking dogs lost his scent in a marshy area near the\nprison. Seven days of searching, including flyovers by helicopters\nwith heat-sensing devices, had turned up no leads until the body\nwas found.\n\n   All seven inmates involved in the escape were part of the\nnation's first prison work program to employ death row inmates.\nPrisoners in the program were allowed much more freedom to move\nabout the prison than other death row inmates.\n\n   At least one of the killers who tried to escape with Gurule had\nattempted escape before. Despite that 1993 attempt, he was returned\nto the work program, which produces prison clothing and other goods\nfor the corrections system.\n\n   The controversial program was suspended by Criminal Justice\nBoard Chairman Allan Polunsky earlier this week, pending an\ninvestigation. The captured inmates have been placed in\nadministrative segregation, a high-security setting in which they\nare allowed to leave their cells for only an hour a day.\n\n   Earlier Thursday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush demanded answers and\nasked the Texas Rangers to step in and conduct their own\ninvestigation.\n\n   ``I'm upset about it,'' Bush said during an Austin news\nconference.\n\n   The Rangers, the investigative arm of the Texas Department of\nPublic Safety, had participated in the hunt for Gurule since\nMonday, three days after the break, officials said. But Bush said\nhe wanted a full investigation.\n\n   Gurule was sentenced to death for shooting Minas ``Mike''\nPiperis on Oct. 12, 1992, during a robbery at a Corpus Christi\nrestaurant which Piperis co-owned with his brother, George.
