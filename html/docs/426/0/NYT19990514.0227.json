It's naive to think that Springer and other greedy\npurveyors who exploit human frailties for cinematic sport have not\nrestructured what we see on television.\n\n   Let's face it: The more we get the more we can take and thereby\naccept within the standards and practices of our personal\ntelevision viewing.\n\n   And although there has been no shortage of public and media\noutcry over the explosion of explicit content, the healthy ratings\nof such shows _ and the new ones that keep appearing _ simply don't\njibe with our heartfelt concern.\n\n   Pacing our collective viewing these days is this kind of\nratings-rich phenomenon of reality programming, shows promising to\ngive viewers the real deal with real conflict, real emotion and\nreal blood. ``Cops'' is quietly celebrating its 10th year, for\nexample. After initially throwing up our hands about cameras\naccompanying police officers into private homes as they settle\ndisputes, usually with force and often with the innocent, we said\nlittle when the copycats followed, upping the ante.\n\n   No wonder Jenny Jones told ``Dateline NBC'' on Sunday that she\nexpects ratings for her talker to remain healthy despite being\nfound liable (to the tune of $25 million) last week in the shooting\ndeath of a guest.\n\n   To Jones, Jonathan Schmitz, who shot Scott Amedure three days\nafter the two taped a same-sex crush segment, was a troubled man\nwho would have harmed Amedure even had the two never set foot on\nher stage.\n\n   The jury agreed that Schmitz was mentally unstable, but found\nJones' producers negligent in putting him on the show and then\nhumiliating him.\n\n   Jones' most unsettling statement to NBC's Jane Pauley wasn't\nthat she felt no guilt or responsibility in the death of one man\nand the imprisonment of another, but that shows like hers will be\naround as long we watch them.\n\n   Case in point: The major networks have, in the past three years,\nquadrupled their use of reality specials, programs like ``Wildest\nPolice Videos,'' which Fox aired last month. That show featured a\nlaw enforcement officer being struck head-on by a car, another\nbeing shot, another being attacked by a dog.\n\n   In March 1997, you could find only 11 reality-TV segments\ntotaling two hours of weekly programming on all the major networks\ncombined. In March of this year, according to the newsletter NewsTV\nReports, there were 118 segments totaling eight hours weekly.\n\n   ``You don't want to censor, and you want to believe that viewers\nshould choose their pleasure or pain,'' says Michael Filberg, a\nformer professor of media studies who works as a consultant for a\nSeattle-based advertising and marketing firm. ``But at the same\ntime, any responsible human being has to wonder, `So what's next?\nHow will we top this?'''\n\n   Programmers will top it by tweaking the shows that are already\nout there. The other day, I viewed a pilot called ``Cheaters,''\nwhich catches adulterers on videotape, and then tapes ``the\nconfrontation'' in all its gory detail.\n\n   In the pilot, which features actors, a woman leaps out of a\nsurveillance van with a camera crew and tries to wrestle her\n``husband'' to the ground. Selling points were the woman sobbing as\nshe watched hidden camera videotape of her hubby and lover kissing,\nand then physically attacking him. In another segment, a gay man\nand his lover go through the same tango, with yelling and screaming\nand more chaos.\n\n   Set to air in the fall as a syndicated program, ``Cheaters'' has\nalready filmed a number of segments with real people, one featuring\na Dallas woman who was confronted at The Blue Goose restaurant on\nlower Greenville Avenue. Her husband walked up to his wife and her\nlover and screamed, ``What the hell (are) you doing!?'' Restaurant\npatrons looked on; the cameras rolled.\n\n   Other incidents so far, in cities like Cleveland, Detroit and\nNew York City, have included fistfights and riotlike situations, as\nbystanders are energized by the TV cameras.\n\n   To ``Cheaters'' creator Bobby Goldstein, a Dallas attorney, the\nmore riotous, the better; he knows that will only enhance the\ntrain-wreck appeal of his series. He admits that ``Cheaters'' was\nturned down by the networks after ``heavy'' talks about how they\ncould get it on air with the least backlash. But judging by the\nnumber of markets (not this one yet) that have already bought the\nprogram, ``Cheaters'' will find a home.\n\n   Goldstein laughs at the thought of his program humiliating\nanyone, instead considering his ``Cheaters,'' which is being\ndistributed by Los Angeles-based Keller Entertainment, as merely\ngiving audiences what they crave. Even need.\n\n   ``You have the group that's compassionate, who could relate to\nthe victim or the complainant,'' he says. ``They would watch them\nand want to have pain with them. The other (group) is satisfying\ntheir voyeuristic interests in other people. The other is the cruel\nelement of the human kind that looks to watch other people caught\nin something.''\n\n   Springer, too, has said in interviews that reality TV will\nremain a force because viewers are tired of fiction, of fantasy, of\nsitcoms that are silly and unbelievable and dramas that would carry\nmore dramatic weight if they were real. Scary as it sounds, viewers\nhave seen so many staged fights and killings, only the ``real''\nthing is of interest.\n\n   Such programming was inevitable, and that's why shows such as\n``Change of Heart'' (where couples berate one another, as well as\nthe person whom producers set up for their significant other to\ndate) were conceived. And it's why Goldstein is forging ahead with\n``Cheaters,'' believing that reality programming represents ``a\nform of truth'' that we can't resist as viewers.\n\n   Although reckless, irresponsible talk hosts and reality\nprogrammers have been castigated, the rules have been stretched for\nsome well-respected series. Certain allowances for language and\nadult themes were offered to ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``Hill Street\nBlues'' and to such current shows as ``Ally McBeal'' and ``NYPD\nBlue,'' which brought seminudity to prime time.\n\n   Once these shows claimed new territory in terms of what could be\nshown and said, was it any surprise that sleazier programmers saw\nan opportunity to pick up the baton and make a dash?\n\n   Fox, for example, is the king of reality specials, showing\ngrisly footage of people hurt in attacks by animals, and it is\nfending off accusations of staging or fabricating aspects of those\nshows to make them ``more dramatic.''\n\n   Last year, Los Angeles television stations interrupted\nchildren's programming to provide live coverage of a standoff\nbetween police and a man blocking a freeway. He eventually set\nhimself and his dog on fire, and then, after staggering out of his\ntruck, put a shotgun under his chin and fired.\n\n   Twenty-five million is a lot of money, but I don't see Jenny\nJones sweating. She's frustrated, tired, perturbed, maybe. But\ntomorrow, she'll tape another segment.
