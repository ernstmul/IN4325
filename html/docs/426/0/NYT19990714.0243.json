His email address is levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)\n      \n       By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY \n       c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune \n\n   To see how money corrupts law enforcement agencies, look at the\neffects of asset forfeiture laws. A police officer can take all the\nmoney you are carrying and the car you are driving when stopped --\non the mere suspicion that you are a drug dealer -- yet never\ncharge you with a crime. And it will take you years and thousands\nof dollars to recover your property -- if it is even possible to\nrecover it. Your car may have been sold already or badly damaged.\n\n   In such forfeiture, called a civil asset forfeiture because you\nwere never charged with a crime, you must prove in a court of law\nthat the money and the car are legally yours and were never\ninvolved in some crime. In other words, you have to prove you are\nan innocent party -- and, stupid as it sounds, you may have to\nprove that your property is innocent, too. The government doesn't\nhave to prove you were guilty of anything.\n\n   While it may be easy to prove you are the legal owner of the\ncar, it is far more difficult to prove the money you were carrying\nis money you earned at your job. Imagine how hard it would be to\nprove your car or money were never used to facilitate a crime.\n\n   An attorney can cost you thousands of dollars to sue for\nrecovery of your property. Legal counsel is not provided in such\ncases.\n\n   Many people in similar situations simply let it go and don't try\nto recover their property. Why spend $6,000 on attorney fees to\nrecover $5,000?\n\n   Federal, state and local law enforcement officials put the money\ngained from forfeitures into their agencies' accounts and buy new\npolice cars, hire more law enforcement agents and, in some\ninstances, use the ill-gained dollars to throw self-congratulatory\nparties or buy trucks and sports cars for members of the law\nenforcement team to keep as their own.\n\n   The preeminent constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy calls the\ncurrent laws of asset forfeiture `A License to Steal,` the title of\nhis 1996 book on the subject of forfeitures of property. And,\nindeed, they are.\n\n   The evidence of the misuse of these forfeiture laws is\ncompelling. The evidence demands a change in the laws. The civil\nforfeiture laws are unAmerican. They attack the basic right of\nproperty and individual ownership. No matter what the U.S. Supreme\nCourt has ruled, at heart, these civil forfeiture laws are\nunconstitutional. Under the current federal forfeiture statutes no\nlaw-abiding citizen's property is safe from seizure.\n\n   The 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act, passed by Congress,\nturned law enforcement officers into pirates -- the spoils being\nthe property of innocent citizens. The American Civil Liberties\nUnion states that `nearly 80 percent of the victims of forfeiture\nhave never been indicted of a crime.`\n\n   On April 5, 1992, the Pittsburgh Press reported that Tracy\nThomas had $13,000 taken from her by local police. The police were\nsearching for drugs allegedly sold by Thomas' godson. A state judge\nordered police to return the money to Thomas. Instead, the police\nturned the money over to the Drug Enforcement Administration which\nis immune to the state courts order.\n\n   On Aug. 2, 1992, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Ken Brown's\nFlorida business, Chemco International, was raided because agents\nof the DEA found his company's labels in a methamphetamine lab. The\nchemicals Brown sold are legal to sell in small quantities. Among\nhis customers were the U.S. Forest Service and the Florida State\nFish and Game Commission. DEA agents raided Brown's home because an\ninformant described Brown as the leader of a motorcycle gang.\nFederal agents used the forfeiture laws to seize Brown's business,\n$300,000 in inventory, his home and cars. Brown was never convicted\nof a drug crime. The DEA offered to release his house and cars to\nBrown, if he surrendered his legitimate business.\n\n   On Jan. 4, 1993, Newsweek reported that Gary and Kathy Bergman\nof South Dakota had their house taken after federal agents found\nthat a house guest possessed marijuana. Agents also found traces of\nmarijuana in a car owned by the Bergmans's daughter. The house was\nnever returned to the Bergmans even though they were never charged\nwith a federal crime.\n\n   On Feb. 18, 1998, the Houston Chronicle reported that federal\nagents seized the Red Carpet Inn located in South Houston. A number\nof customers of the hotel were accused of drug trafficking. The\nhotel owners were not accused of participating in the illegal\nactivity; nevertheless, the hotel was taken.\n\n   In 1992, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals admonished the\nDEA for assisting the Plaquemines Parish (La.) Sheriff's Office in\ncircumventing Louisiana law. The sheriff had taken over $12,000 in\ncash from Jeffery Scarabin, a suspected drug dealer. All the\ncharges against Scarabin were dismissed for lack of evidence, yet\nthe sheriff's office never returned the money taken from Scarabin,\neven when ordered to do so by a state court. Someone in the\nsheriff's office bought a cashier's check forthe amount of money\ntaken from Scarabin. The check was then handed over to the DEA as a\ncivil forfeiture under federal law.\n\n   In 1998, the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals accused the\nMissouri Highway Patrol and the DEA of conspiring to ignore\nMissouri law by not turning over $844,000 seized from Dennis Cole\nwho had been stopped for speeding. He was never charged with any\ndrug activities.\n\n   Newspapers like the Kansas City Star, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,\nMiami Herald, St. Petersburg Times, Orlando Sentinel, Hartford\nCourant, San Jose Mercury News, Louisville Courier-Journal,\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch have all\ndocumented various local and regional shady deals law enforcement\nagencies at every level have made using civil asset forfeiture\nlaws. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., used many of these news reports in\nhis 1995 book, `Forfeiting Our Property Rights,` to prove the law\nmust be changed.\n\n   Hyde has sponsored a bill (H.R. 1658), the Civil Asset\nForfeiture Reform Act, to return some sanity to law enforcement and\nrestore due process to the current civil asset forfeiture laws. On\nJune 24, the bill passed in the House by an overwhelming majority,\n375 to 48. It has been read in the Senate twice and referred to the\nSenate Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n   The bill requires law enforcement agencies to have greater proof\nof criminal activity before seizing property. It provides\ncourt-appointed attorneys so that citizens can challenge a\nforfeiture without cost to themselves. The bill gives property\nowners who have been found innocent, or never charged, a right to\nget their seized property back in a specific, short time period.\nAnd the bill provides compensation to property owners for damage to\ntheir property or for the loss of that property when it was in\ngovernment control.\n\n   Time to call your senators and demand a quick passage of Hyde's\nforfeiture reform bill.
