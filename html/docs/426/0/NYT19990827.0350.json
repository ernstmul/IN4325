Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Over the objections of civil liberties groups and\nprivacy advocates, the federal government Friday announced new\ntechnical standards for cellular phones that will broadly expand\nthe ability of law enforcement agents to monitor conversations and\nlocate criminal suspects.\n\n   Federal and local agents can already monitor cellular phone\ncalls after obtaining a court warrant. But under the rules\nannounced Friday by the Federal Communications Commission, they\nwill also be able to determine the general location of a cell phone\nuser by identifying which cellular antenna was used by the phone\ncompany to transmit the beginning and end of any call under\nsurveillance.\n\n   The rules will permit agents to identify all callers on a\nconference call and monitor such conversations even after the\ntarget of the inquiry is no longer part of the conversation. And\nthey will enable agents to determine whether suspects are making\nuse of such common cellular phone features as call forwarding and\ncall waiting.\n\n   Although the number of intercepted communications approved by\nfederal and State courts over the last decade has nearly doubled,\nreaching 1,329 last year, law enforcement officials say they have\nhad difficulty keeping up with the explosive popularity of cellular\nphones. Senior officials at the FBI have spent years seeking new\nauthority beyond just monitoring the calls as mobile phones have\nbecome inexpensive and ubiquitious.\n\n   At the same time, privacy advocates have warned that broadening\nthe ability of law enforcement to monitor more than simply the\ncontent of such calls would be deeply intrusive. Law enforcement\nofficials have asserted that since the location of wired telephones\nwas already public information, there is no intrusion of privacy in\ndetermining the location of wireless phones.\n\n   The telephone industry was also resistant to change and had\nsought to delay some of the technical changes in their systems that\nwere announced Friday on the ground that they would be too\nexpensive to implement. Industry executives said Friday that they\nwould be unable to meet the regulators' timetable and thus would\nseek permission to delay complying with the new rules.\n\n   Friday's ruling was a clear victory for the law enforcement\ngroups and a setback for the privacy organizations. The decision\nfollows years of fruitless negotiations between the phone\ncompanies, the Justice Department, privacy groups and\ntelecommunications regulators that began in 1994, after Congress\napproved major legislation called the Communications Assistance for\nLaw Enforcement Act.\n\n   It required the cellular phone industry to design its systems to\ncomply with new standards that would make it easier for the FBI to\nmonitor calls. But the law left it to the FCC to determine the\nprecise contours of those standards, as well as the FBI's ability\nto monitor more than just the conversations.\n\n   Industry executives said that while they believed the new rules\nwent beyond what was authorized in the law, they would comply with\nthem.\n\n   ``The wireless industry now can build and implement these\ncapabilities, but we require a realistic deployment schedule, one\nthat the industry can plan for and meet,'' said Tom Wheeler,\npresident of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.\nSome of the rules become effective next June 30, and others on\nSept. 30, 2001.\n\n   Senior officials at the Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded\nthe rules, saying they would be a powerful new tool in combatting\ncrime.\n\n   ``The continuing technological changes in the nation's\ntelecommunications systems present increasing challenges to law\nenforcement,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``This ruling will\nenable law enforcement to keep pace with these changes and ensure\nwe will be able to maintain our capability to conduct\ncourt-authorized electronic surveillance.''\n\n   Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, said the decision by the\nFCC was ``an extremely important and positive public safety\nruling.''\n\n   ``From the FBI's perspective, the FCC's announced ruling goes a\nlong way to balance public safety, privacy and the needs of\ntelecommunications carriers to remain competitive in today's\nmarket,'' Freeh said.\n\n   Officials at the FCC said they had struck the appropriate\ncompromise between law enforcement interests against privacy\nconcerns.\n\n   ``We have carefully balanced law enforcement's needs against the\nrights of all Americans to privacy, and the cost to industry of\nproviding these tools to assist law enforcement,'' said William\nKennard, the FCC chairman.\n\n   But civil liberties and privacy groups said the decision would\nyield a sweeping new intrusion into privacy rights and expressed\nalarm that telecommunications policy-makers had largely ignored\ntheir concerns.\n\n   ``We are deeply disappointed that on all the issues that\nmattered, the commission ruled against privacy and in favor of\nexpanded FBI surveillance,'' said Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel\nfor the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties\ngroup that studies technology issues.\n\n   David Sobel, the general counsel of the Electronic Privacy\nInformation Center, said today's rules reminded him of the way\ntotalitarian countries relied on authoritarian figures to impose\ntheir most important policy issues.\n\n   ``This represents an unprecedented expansion of law\nenforcement,'' Sobel said. ``We have reached the point where law\nenforcement is dictating our nation's telecommunications\nstandards.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
