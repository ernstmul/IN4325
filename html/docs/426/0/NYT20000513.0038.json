Times News Service clients)  \n BY MARY JO PITZL AND JUDD SLIVKA  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n     \n(SANTA FE, N.M.) _ It will be at least a week before the 11,000\ndisplaced residents of Los Alamos will be allowed to return to\ntheir fire-scarred town.\n\n   So, when local radio stations announced where people could\ndiscover whether their homes were still standing, evacuees spilled\nfrom hotels and friends' homes, creating a traffic jam on New\nMexico 502 at the turnoff to Pojoaque High School.\n\n   There, they found Red Cross volunteer Marion Johnson standing on\na chair, yelling out the addresses of the 260 homes destroyed by\nthis week's ``Cerro Grande'' fire.\n\n   ``OK, Ridgeway! I'm still doing Ridgeway!'' Johnson shouted.\nThen louder, ``I'm still on Ridgeway! I haven't gotten to another\nstreet!''\n\n   In the mountains above, the fire continued to grow across 32,000\nacres, singeing the edges of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\n   One woman waited for the bad news, then stood shaking in the\ncrowd, holding her lunch: a salad with dressing that rippled as she\nshook. Her husband stood next to her, stroking her hair. She walked\ndownstairs, away from the crowd and sat on an Army cot, head in her\nhands, crying.\n\n   Cindy Blossom found her home was not on the list, though houses\non either side of hers were destroyed.\n\n   ``This is the power of prayer,'' she said, bouncing up and down\nand glowing. ``That's what it was. I asked him to put up a hedge or\nsome kind of protection, and I knew he would.''\n\n   Wilbur Bergquist couldn't believe his house wasn't on the list.\nHe kept scouring the pages taped to the wall, fingering each line,\nsaying his address over and over again.\n\n   ``I thought it was going to be totally gone,'' he said. ``Up\nuntil now, I was thinking that I was going to have to rebuild\neverything.''   \nFLOOD OF SUPPLIES   \nThey wiped out the underwear selection at Wal-Mart.\n\n   They toted toiletries, hauled hay and carted canned goods until\nthe governor, of all people, had to stand up and publicly say, ``No\nmas!''\n\n   ``The Red Cross has asked me to make you aware that they can't\nhandle any more clothing or food,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said Friday\nafternoon. ``Right now, we need some money.''\n\n   New Mexicans opened their hearts, wallets and truck beds to\nbring supplies to victims of the Cerro Grande fire.\n\n   ``They're doing things, and it's really making a devastating\ntime better,'' said Julie Pugsley, a Los Alamos evacuee.\n\n   Julie and her husband, Robert, were staying at an Albuquerque\nhotel, courtesy of her employer, US West. The company also picked\nup their cleaning tab.\n\n   Volunteers from throughout northern New Mexico pitched in to\nround up animals stranded by the fire and house them in a makeshift\nanimal shelter at the Santa Fe Rodeo grounds.\n\n   The Pugsleys found their 3-year-old cat, Shasta, at the rodeo\nshelter Friday, after searching two kennels for their lost pet. The\nreunion was joyous, even though the couple were unsure of the fate\nof their home.\n\n   Robert was hopeful, saying he had seen the intact roof of their\nhome on a television news clip.\n\n   ``There's a spruce tree in front that's 30 feet tall, and the\ngrass is green,'' Pugsley said. ``You walk 50 feet to the right,\nand the house is down to its foundation.''\n\n   But Julie was pessimistic. She had just spied their neighbor's\naddress on a list of 191 Los Alamos homes destroyed by the\nwind-whipped blaze.   \nMARVEL AT GENEROSITY   \nThroughout Santa Fe on Friday, fire victims marveled at the\ngenerosity of their neighbors.\n\n   ``We might all be a little crazy around here, but when there's a\nproblem, people here really come together,'' said Talina\nMelenchenko, as she shushed a crowing rooster at the animal\nshelter.\n\n   She had traveled from Madrid to pitch in, giving Gatorade to\nrefugee rabbits and slicing up apples for the chickens. The shelter\noverflowed with donations from area residents.\n\n   Sacks of dog chow were piled high, rivaling the height of nearby\nbags of cat litter. Rugs, blankets and sheets abounded for bedding.\nOutside, Diann Mills was drying off one of the scores of animal\ncarriers that volunteers had donated.\n\n   Mills, who evacuated her Los Alamos home Wednesday, said\npitching in was better than sitting in her hotel room. Besides, she\nsaid, working was a way to delay learning about the fate of her\nhome.\n\n   ``I was so impressed with everybody,'' Mills said. ``I heard\nthey estimated it would take 10 hours to get people out of town,\nand it took four hours. I was just proud of everyone.''\n\n   Travis Law, Met Haynes and Ryan Boudrie are the pride of their\nLos Alamos families and friends. The three young men drove through\nthe spreading Los Alamos fire Wednesday, ferrying out livestock and\npets. Their three trips rescued 15 horses, 11 bulls and two goats.\n\n   ``You could touch the windows on both sides of my truck and they\nwere hot,'' Law, 17, recalled. The flames rose up on both sides of\nthe road like a tidal wave, and smoke obscured all but a few feet\nof road, he said.\n\n   When he returned home after the animal rescue, Law said he had\nno interest in watching television coverage of the disaster.\n\n   ``I'd been there, done that, driven through it, don't want to do\nit again,'' Law said.   \n   \nReach the reporters at Judd.Slivka(at)Arizona   \nRepublic.com or (602) 444-8097; and MaryJo.Pitzl(at)Arizona   \nRepublic.com or (602) 444-8963.  \n","Headline":"\nLOS ALAMOS: CINDERS, DESPAIR\n","Text":["\n     \n(SANTA FE, N.M.) _ It will be at least a week before the 11,000\ndisplaced residents of Los Alamos will be allowed to return to\ntheir fire-scarred town.\n","\n   So, when local radio stations announced where people could\ndiscover whether their homes were still standing, evacuees spilled\nfrom hotels and friends' homes, creating a traffic jam on New\nMexico 502 at the turnoff to Pojoaque High School.\n","\n   There, they found Red Cross volunteer Marion Johnson standing on\na chair, yelling out the addresses of the 260 homes destroyed by\nthis week's ``Cerro Grande'' fire.\n","\n   ``OK, Ridgeway!
