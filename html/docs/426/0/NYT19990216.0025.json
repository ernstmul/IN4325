For release Sunday, Feb. 21.\n      Eds: In graf 15, (tilde) stands for the tilde symbol.\n      By ANDREW ALEXANDER\n      c.1999 Cox News Service\n\n   WASHINGTON _ ``You're kidding!'' my wife exclaimed.\n\n   I had just told her that someone had gained access to our\nprivate bank records, lifted our account number and recorded our\nbalance.\n\n   She listened in stunned silence. There was more.\n\n   They had also tracked our recent long-distance calls,\nidentifying those we had telephoned by name, address and\noccupation. And they had compiled dossiers on us, complete with\nSocial Security numbers, property holdings and financial dealings.\n\n   ``That's incredible,'' she said. ``How can they do that?''\n\n   Easily, it turns out, in the computer age.\n\n   ``They,'' I finally confessed, was actually my Cox Newspapers\nWashington Bureau colleague Elliot Jaspin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning\nhigh-tech wizard who had delved into our personal lives at my\ninvitation.\n\n   He was trying to come up with a way for our reporters to use\ncomputer databases to do background checks on little-known figures\nwho suddenly break into the news, quickly learning about pending\nlawsuits or long-concealed arrests.\n\n   Start with only my name, I suggested, and see what you can get.\n\n   He hit pay dirt within a few days.\n\n   Given more time _ and a little money _ he soon would have been\nable to obtain confidential records of my credit card purchases,\nsalary, stocks, bonds, credit history, life insurance policy,\nrecent air travel, whether I had ever been nailed for speeding, and\neven my medical records going back 10 years.\n\n   While the popular notion is that a computer linked to the\nInternet is a key that unlocks all kinds of personal secrets, most\ndatabases on the Internet are dull as dishwater.\n\n   Switchboard (http://www.switchboard.com), for example, will\nallow you to instantly discover Uncle Edgar's telephone number in\nDubuque. But then, calling Dubuque information will get you the\nsame thing.\n\n   The Internet, however, carries ads for a burgeoning and largely\nuncontrolled industry of ``information brokers'' that _ for a fee _\nwill reveal the most intimate details of your life, right down to\nthat birthmark on your backside or ancient records of psychological\ntreatment.\n\n   For fees as low as $1.50 a minute or $40 per search, they will\ndisclose non-published telephone numbers or track down the owners\nof private aircraft. Corporate Investigative Services of\nHuntsville, Ala., has a Web site\n(http://www.hsv.tis.net/(tilde)pvteye/source.html) that also allows\nyou to listen to the theme music from ``Mission Impossible'' while\nyou link to hundreds of other sites.\n\n   Some companies, like AutoTrack, have assembled massive\ncomputerized databases containing several billion public records.\nUsing sophisticated database software, information is quickly\nplucked from scores of different files, and within minutes is woven\ntogether into a report.\n\n   It was through such a company that Jaspin unearthed a loan I\ntook out in North Carolina and the tax records on property I own in\nVirginia.\n\n   AutoTrack files are interesting, but not nearly as revealing as\ncompanies that use what they politely term ``pretexts'' to shoehorn\ninformation from banks, phone companies, and whomever else you may\ndo business with. The major weapon here is a huckster's patter\nrather than a computer.\n\n   Judging from information broker ads, everything is up for grabs.\nThat includes such sensitive financial information as the location\nof your safe deposit box, your bank deposits anywhere in the world,\nand even your bank account history, including dates and amounts of\ndeposits, checks written or wire transfers.\n\n   As privacy expert Robert Ellis Smith of Rhode Island noted,\n``Every fact about you is on record somewhere,'' and information\nbrokers see that as fair game. Posing as a forgetful husband,\ntelephone repairman, or bank clerk, a private investigator can\noften get this information by outwitting low-level clerks at the\nphone company or some obscure branch of a major bank.\n\n   There are few laws forbidding disclosure.\n\n   ``It's our company policy not to release any customer\ninformation without a court order or some legal document,'' said\nSandy Arnette, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic in Baltimore. ``But\nthere is no state or federal law against disclosure.''\n\n   In fact, the House Banking Committee found only three states _\nConnecticut, Illinois and Maine _ with laws making it a crime to\ninduce an employee of a financial institution to disclose data\nabout a customer's account. And there are no federal statutes\nagainst using ``pretexts'' to wangle private data from financial\ninstitutions.\n\n   Rep. James A. Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking\nCommittee, tried unsuccessfully to get the practice outlawed last\nyear, and he has introduced the same bill again this year.\n\n   But who cares if you have a checking account in Duluth and own\n40 acres of scrub land in Texas?\n\n   Creditors do.\n\n   Banks, who need to collect on bad credit card debts, routinely\nturn to lawyers who specialize in collections. And these lawyers,\nin turn, use information brokers to find assets they can attach.\n\n   ``We do a lot of credit card collection. Thousands of cases a\nweek,'' said Mike Martin of Advanced Research, Inc.\n\n   The American Bankers Association supports Leach's proposed\nlegislation to outlaw fraudulently obtaining information from\nbanks. But at the same time, Martin noted, ABA member banks ``hire\nus to do exactly what it is they're trying to shut down.''\n\n   Information brokers will also chase deadbeat dads.\n\n   ``Very often, it gets used for good purposes,'' said private\ninvestigator Edmund Pankau of Houston.\n\n   ``Not long ago,'' he recalled, his firm traced the financial\ndealings of a Houston man who had left his family. The information\nallowed them to locate the man in another city. ``He had skipped\nout on his ex-wife,'' Pankau said, ``but they needed to find him\nbecause his daughter needed a bone marrow transplant and he was the\nonly one who could help.''\n\n   Some in the press also use information brokers to snoop. Al\nSchweitzer, a controversial private investigator _ he pleaded\nguilty in 1992 to illegally buying Social Security records _ became\na legend by compiling detailed dossiers on Hollywood stars for the\nNational Enquirer.\n\n   After actor Kiefer Sutherland split from Julia Roberts,\nSchweitzer used her phone records to locate him at his ranch in\nWhitefish, Mont. He used the same method to track down Marlon\nBrando's daughter in Tahiti.\n\n   In cases like these, no one lost anything more than privacy, and\nprobably some sleepless nights worrying that Schweitzer was\nconstantly on the prowl. But there is a darker side.\n\n   Federal officials express growing concern about ``identity\nfraud'' or ``identity theft,'' in which a con artist uses purloined\npersonal financial information to assume your identity, then loots\nyour bank account or makes costly purchases with your credit card\nnumber.\n\n   The extent to which Americans are actually harmed by this is\nunclear.\n\n   A report last year by the General Accounting Office, the\ninvestigative arm of Congress, suggests a startling rise in\nidentity fraud. Trans Union, a leading credit reporting firm, told\nGAO that the number of inquiries about credit fraud it receives\neach year jumped from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922 in 1997. Two-thirds\ninvolved identity fraud.\n\n   But in the same report, GAO acknowledged that it could find ``no\ncomprehensive statistics on the prevalence of identity fraud.''\n\n   Pressured by the Federal Trade Commission and the threat of\nrestrictive legislation, some large data collection firms have\nbegun self-regulation. Several such companies represented by the\nIndividual Reference Services Group recently agreed to abide by\nrules limiting unauthorized disclosure of information.\n\n   But hundreds of other firms remain essentially unregulated,\nincluding the bulk of information brokers.\n\n   A decade ago, only a handful existed. Today, said Evan\nHendricks, editor of the Washington-based Privacy Times newsletter,\nthere may be as many as 2,000.\n\n   The explosion of the Internet and higher-powered computers means\nwe've entered an era where ``nothing is private,'' warned Pankau.\n\n   ``I can't think of anything that's private,'' agreed Smith, who\npublishes Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter that monitors how\nnew technology affects privacy.\n\n   But the extent of actual financial harm is difficult to gauge.\n\n   My wife later acknowledged that she was most troubled by the\nnotion that someone could so easily obtain information we thought\nwas private.
