(js) \n By DAVID ROHDE   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Law-enforcement officials announced the indictments\nFriday of 102 members of a sophisticated drug operation that\ndiscreetly sold millions of dollars' worth of crack cocaine to\nwhite-collar workers in midtown Manhattan over the last decade.\n\n   Investigators said the seven gangs involved catered to what the\ndealers called the ``S and T crowd'' _ the suit and tie crowd.\n\n   At a news conference, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said\nthe suspects were indicted on felony charges of conspiracy,\nnarcotics sales, weapons possession, attempted murder and assault.\nHe said 77 of the gang members were in custody and 25 were being\nsought.\n\n   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who also appeared at the news\nconference, said the drug operations were among the largest in the\ncity.\n\n   Twenty-seven of the suspects identified themselves as members of\nsubgroups of the Bloods street gang, based in Los Angeles,\ninvestigators said. But Safir said the gangs appeared to have no\nlink to the Bloods.\n\n   Law enforcement officials said the gang members' practice of\nselling drugs indoors and the fact that they shunned firearms\nshowed the evolution and adaptability of the drug trade under the\nGiuliani administration's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes.\n\n   They said a continuing demand for drugs fueled the operation.\nHalf of its $5.5 million in annual sales were made to white-collar\nworkers, investigators said. Business was most brisk in the early\nmorning, when office workers arrived for work, and at noon, when\nthey went on lunch breaks.\n\n   Walter Arsenault, assistant Manhattan district attorney, said\nthe white-collar workers ``bought big and they paid twice as\nmuch.''\n\n   In a shift from the aggressive, gun-toting drug gangs of the\nearly 1990s, the five gangs involved apparently shunned\nconfrontation with other gangs to avoid drawing police attention.\n\n   Initially, the gangs operated out of the former Evans Hotel at\n273 W. 38th St. near Eighth Avenue, and then worked around the\ncorner in the Mammoth Pool Hall at 550 Eighth Ave., officials said.\nTo avoid warfare, dealers declared a truce and worked out a shift\nschedule among themselves, officials said.\n\n   Dealers from different gangs shared customers and drug supplies\nand even warned each other when police approached, investigators\nsaid. In a major shift that law-enforcement officials said helps\nexplain the city's plummeting homicide rate, disputes among the\ngangs were settled by slashings and stabbings, not by gun battles.\nGang members told the police that they no longer carry guns because\nthey fear that they will be stopped by police officers enforcing\nthe city's crackdown on low-level crimes, authorities said.\n\n   In the arrests of the gang members, only four guns were seized,\nlaw enforcement officials said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Arsenault said he believed that the small number of guns seized\nand the small number of shootings involving the gangs, two since\n1996, showed that the police crackdown is getting guns off city\nstreets. Fewer guns means that confrontations among drug dealers\nresult in stabbing wounds instead of fatal shootings, he said.\n\n   ``We've been doing drug gang cases for 10 years,'' he said.\n``I've had one other case with one stabbing. This case had five.''\n\n   The decade-long gold rush for the drug operations ended in\nJanuary, when renovations forced one of the gangs, the Dog Pound\nGang, to move out of the West 38th Street building.\n\n   The gang tried to move into the Mammoth Pool Hall, where four\nother gangs _ the Green Team, the Blueberries, the Yellow Bags and\nthe Clear Team _ had been cooperating with one another,\ninvestigators said. The gangs took their names from the color of\nthe bags they used to package the crack, investigators added.\n\n   The Dog Pound Gang refused to take part in the existing\noperation, and in January, two Dog Pound members shot and wounded a\nBlueberries manager, law enforcement officials said. The shooting\ndrew the authorities' attention and eventually led to Friday's\nindictments. ``They got greedy,'' Safir said.\n\n   Two factions of a neighborhood gang known as the Gangsta Killa\nBloods then moved into the pool hall, establishing a truce with the\nClear Team and Yellow Bags gangs. The Dog Pound, Green Team and\nBlueberries gangs were forced out.\n\n   Owners of nearby businesses said they were pleased that the drug\noperations had been dismantled. Andrew Scheman, owner of Scheman &\nGrant Hardware, said the drug trade has been a long-running\nproblem.\n\n   ``Drug dealing really affects my business,'' he said. ``You can\nget killed around here if you don't know what you're doing.''\n\n   Police investigators said the office workers were apparently\nuncomfortable buying their drugs on the street.\n\n   During surveillance operations, office workers described by\ninvestigators as ``men and women in suits carrying briefcases''\nwere seen buying their drugs in the stairwell leading to the\nMammoth Pool Hall on the building's third floor.\n\n   A few office workers immediately smoked the crack in the pool\nhall's bathroom, investigators said, but most left with the drugs.\nThe dealers took advantage of their prime location and raised their\nprices accordingly, Arsenault said.\n\n   ``It was a very lucrative operation,'' he said. ``What was sold\nfor $5 dollars to an addict was sold for $10, $15 or $20 to the\nsuit-and-tie crowd.''\n","Headline":"\n102 INDICTED IN CRACK SALES TO WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS IN MANHATTAN \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Law-enforcement officials announced the indictments\nFriday of 102 members of a sophisticated drug operation that\ndiscreetly sold millions of dollars' worth of crack cocaine to\nwhite-collar workers in midtown Manhattan over the last decade.\n","\n   Investigators said the seven gangs involved catered to what the\ndealers called the ``S and T crowd'' _ the suit and tie crowd.\n","\n   At a news conference, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said\nthe suspects were indicted on felony charges of conspiracy,\nnarcotics sales, weapons possession, attempted murder and assault.\nHe said 77 of the gang members were in custody and 25 were being\nsought.\n","\n   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who also appeared at the news\nconference, said the drug operations were among the largest in the\ncity.\n","\n   Twenty-seven of the suspects identified themselves as members of\nsubgroups of the Bloods street gang, based in Los Angeles,\ninvestigators said.
