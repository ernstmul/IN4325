Since 1976, he has spent much of his time in an office\nat Fort Worth Meacham Airport putting airplane buyers in touch with\nowners, sometimes spending months arranging a single purchase.\n\n   But in 1991 and 1992, the U.S. Customs Service seized two of his\ncustomers' jets because of a paperwork error. Spurlock said he\nspent nine months and thousands of dollars getting them returned.\nHe said he learned that basic legal principles, such as presumption\nof innocence, could be upended by federal asset forfeiture laws.\n\n   ``The rule of law is disappearing. Something needs to be done to\nchange it back,'' said Spurlock, 57, of Fort Worth.\n\n   Eight years later, Congress has acted on his concerns and those\nof hundreds more people who contend that they are innocent victims\nof the forfeiture laws. President Clinton signed the overhaul bill\non Tuesday. A Clinton spokeswoman said the bill will protect the\nrights of the accused while helping law enforcement fight drug\ntrafficking and white-collar crime.\n\n   Will Ferrell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties\nUnion of Texas, calls the bill a ``moral victory'' following the\n``hysteria of the war on drugs.''\n\n   ``Here is an example of how when elected officials really sit\ndown and think about the ramifications of their actions they will\ncome into standing with the Constitution,'' he said.\n\n   The federal government began confiscating money from drug\ndealers in the 1970s, and the practice took off in the 1980s when\nPresident Reagan declared a war on drugs.\n\n   In the Northern District of Texas, which covers Tarrant, Dallas\nand several other counties, it happens about 130 times a year,\nofficials said.\n\n   As Spurlock learned, money is not the only asset seized.\nOfficials can take anything of value, including houses, vehicles\nand jewelry.\n\n   The biggest change in the law is in burden of proof. According\nto the original law, prosecutors only had to show probable cause\nthat property was involved in a crime or bought with ill-gotten\nmoney, and owners had to prove that they were innocent to get back\ntheir property. That is the same level of proof needed to get a\nsearch warrant.\n\n   The new law will require more. It calls for the same amount of\nproof needed to win most civil cases.\n\n   The law also will allow some defendants to have court-appointed\nlawyers, and it holds federal agents responsible for damage to\nseized property. Also, defendants no longer have to put up a bond\nbefore they contest a seizure in court.\n\n   Brock Stevenson, who handles property seizures for the U.S.\nattorney's office in Dallas, said the changes would have a\nnegligible effect.\n\n   ``It'll just put a higher burden on government,'' he said.\n``Most prosecutors, when they take an asset forfeiture case,\nrealize they have to have more than just bare probable cause.''\n\n   The Justice Department asset seizure fund increased from $27\nmillion in 1985 to a peak of $556 million in 1993, according to the\nHouse Judiciary Committee. The fund had $449 million in cash and\nproperty as of 1998, according to the committee.\n\n   Seized cash and property usually are liquidated, then returned\nto the Justice Department or to the agencies that seized them. The\nagencies have broad discretion about how to spend the money.\n\n   During the past two years, police agencies in Texas shared $22.6\nmillion in cash forfeited through state court proceedings and about\n$3 million in liquidated properties, officials said.\n\n   Police departments in Arlington, Fort Worth and Northeast\nTarrant County have funneled that money into anti-drug operations\nand community awareness programs such as Drug Abuse Resistance\nEducation, into purchases of guns and body armor, and to open and\nfurnish storefront offices.\n\n   In 10 years, the North Richland Hills Police Department has\nreceived about $448,000 in federal forfeiture funds and about\n$155,000 from state funds, Police Chief Tom Shockley said.\n\n   The money was used to purchase vehicles, computers and furniture\nand also as ``buy money'' for drug stings, he said.\n\n   ``I think it's helped our community,'' Shockley said.\n\n   ``It's no secret that there have been abuses across the country\nwith some of the seizures,'' he said. ``But the tack we take is,\nlet's not seize what we can seize but see if we can impact the drug\nproblem.''\n\n   Spurlock said he got involved after Customs Service agents\nseized a $450,000 Learjet and a $550,000 Beechcraft he had sold to\ntwo Brazilian businessmen.\n\n   Customs agents seized the jets because the businessmen\nmistakenly indicated that they were owned by a U.S. corporation,\nSpurlock said.\n\n   When U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas looked into the case at\nSpurlock's request, customs officials wrote that they suspected the\nbusinessmen and the pilot of drug smuggling and money laundering.\n\n   Spurlock said he was floored.\n\n   ``One of the sinister parts was they never arrested the people,\ninvestigated them or charged them with the crime,'' he said. ``All\nthey wanted was the property.''\n\n   When the House Judiciary Committee had hearings on asset\nforfeiture, people from across the country shared their stories.\n\n   The practice always has been unpopular with civil libertarians,\nwho say that returning the proceeds to the police gives them an\nincentive to seize property.\n\n   Some, including the ACLU and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of\nHouston, have contended that minorities are disproportionate\ntargets of civil forfeitures.\n\n   Jackson Lee testified that racial profiling by police has\nincreased the number of minorities involved in traffic stops,\nairport searches and drug arrests, which often lead to property\nseizures.\n\n   The overhaul bill was tied up in a conference committee in\nDecember when Customs Service agents evicted Keller resident Misty\nBurton from a small farm she shared with her husband. Police and\ncustoms agents contended that her husband had bought the farm using\ndrug money. Her husband was in prison and she did not find a lawyer\nearly enough to contest the seizure.\n\n   Burton's attorney, Brantley Pringle, made a last-ditch appeal.\nHe argued that the case violated the constitutional guarantee\nagainst unreasonable seizure, and that Burton became part-owner of\nthe farm long after her husband was accused of being involved with\nillegal drugs.\n\n   The government won the case. ``Their contention is the only way\nwe can make this evil property wholesome ... essentially is to take\nit ourselves,'' Pringle said.\n\n   Spurlock said his experience with forfeiture laws continues to\ntrouble him.\n\n   His customers ``only lost an airplane,'' he said. ``I lost my\nConstitution.''\n\n   _\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com) nn\n","Headline":"\nPROPERTY SEIZURE LAWS OVERHAULED\n","Text":["\n   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jim Spurlock is an unlikely activist.\n","\n   The prosperous airplane broker is a private pilot and a lifelong\nRepublican.
