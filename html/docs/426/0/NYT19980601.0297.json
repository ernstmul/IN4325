To increase awareness, the Humane\nSociety and the U.S. Postal Service are dubbing this week as\nNational Dog Bite Prevention Week.\n\n   There are more than 4.5 million bite victims each year and last\nyear 2,708 postal workers were bitten, said Sinclair.\n\n   Houston law requires owners of all dogs with access to a street\nor sidewalk be under physical control, generally a leash, at all\ntimes. Animals at large are subject to pick-up by the city's animal\ncontrol officers.\n\n   The second and each subsequent time a dog bites or attacks a\nperson in Houston, its owner must be fined a minimum of $500.\n\n   Sanchez, who has been with the post office for seven years,\nworks the same route where he was bitten, but he's cautious around\ndogs.\n\n   ``I'm not usually afraid of dogs, but after this happened you\nmight say I am terrified of them,'' he said.\n\n   Edith Arceneaux, 53, is also terrified of the dogs on her mail\nroute _ a large, white pit bull and another dog that stands about 6\nfeet tall when on its hind legs.\n\n   ``Sometimes I do not deliver people's mail until the next day\nbecause their dog is going crazy, barking and snapping at me,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   If postal workers feel that they're in danger at a location,\nthey do not have to deliver mail there that day.\n\n   To help keep letter carriers safe each one carries pepper spray\nto deter attacking dogs.  \n\n     According to the Humane Society most dog bites can be avoided\nthrough prevention methods and having responsible owners.\n\n   ``The best way to prevent dog bites is for owners to have their\ndogs spayed and neutered,'' Barton said. ``Many dog bites are from\ndogs that are in heat, because they are much more aggressive that\nway and if you do this it helps to keep the number of strays\ndown.''\n\n   Sanchez said dog bites also can be prevented if owners take\nresponsibility for their dogs by securely tying them up or placing\nthem behind a fence.\n\n   ``I want people to take care of their dogs so that I don't have\nto worry about getting bit and there are also a lot of kids in\nthese neighborhoods who could be attacked.''\n\n     \n(STORY CAN END HERE.
