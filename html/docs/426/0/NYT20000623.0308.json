The\nSutton Dog Parlour, just a few blocks east of the Regency, offers\noutdoor sandboxes, playhouses, swimming pools, even a little park\nwith a (much-used) fire hydrant, as well as indoor games when the\nweather gets bad, all for $20 to $25 a day, depending on the dog's\nsize.\n\n   For about the same price, Paws Inn, in Chelsea, also has a\nfenced-in roof and rooms full of couches where dogs can sit around\na television that plays ``Lassie'' tapes.\n\n   Other such places include Canine Country, Run Spot Inc.,\nDoggie-Do, and Yuppie Puppy. At each, between 20 and 40 dogs are\ndropped off nearly every weekday morning, and picked up every\nnight.\n\n   Peter Cerbi, owner of Camp Canine, on the Upper West Side, said\nmost of his customers are single or childless couples. ``It's a\ngodsend for these people,'' he said. ``Otherwise, their dogs would\nsit home, chewing on the furniture and going nuts.''\n\n   The New York Department of Health counts 107,753 registered dogs\nin the city _ 25,714 in Manhattan alone, or about one dog for every\n30 households.
