Somewhere near, a dog barks.\n\n   Another barks back and then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, 38\ndogs come to life _ yipping, yapping, yelping _ and the duck\nplunges into the weeds.\n\n   The commotion can only mean one thing.\n\n   Kinky's here!\n\n   Kinky is Kinky Friedman, the cowboy smart-aleck who used to be a\nhippie songwriter and is now a hippie mystery writer with a side\nbusiness of rescuing ugly dogs.\n\n   Kinky saved his first animal in 1979 when he rescued a cat from\na shoe box in Chinatown, but he didn't get nonprofit status until\nspring. That came after he smooth-talked his buddy Willie Nelson\nand his pal former Gov. Ann Richards into helping him form a board\nof directors for the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch. Richards told\nKinky, ``I hope this isn't something I'm going to regret for the\nrest of my life.''\n\n   Here at the ranch, 90 miles west of San Antonio, the dogs behind\nthe chain-link fence step on each other to get attention. Here,\nthey bark and howl and whine when company comes. Here in the Texas\nHill Country, the motto is simple:\n\n   ``We want the dogs nobody wants. If they have a problem, that's\nnot a problem for us.''\n\n   For a stray, it's not a bad place to be. There are blue hills\nand dirt roads and goats grazing. Here, a stray gets one square\nmeal a day, all the fresh water he can lick from a silver pipe, and\nplenty of canine companionship. The ranch is awash in country music\npiped in from a nearby shed. It's the only radio station you get in\nUtopia.\n\n   Patsy Cline seems to like it here. She's a cattle mutt who was\nbrought back because her owner said she didn't bark. (She does.)\nShe's here with Cat _ he's part Catahoula _ who was dropped off at\nthe pound because he ate his owner's Social Security check.\n\n   ``Let's face it,'' Kinky said. ``There are a lot more animals\nworth liking than people.''\n\n   The fence went up in August; the dogs arrived in September. The\nfirst rescue wasn't dramatic. Kinky, ``Cousin Nancy'' Parker, and\nKinky's sister piled into Cousin Nancy's pickup, ``Trigger,'' drove\nto the Hondo, Texas, shelter and said, ``We'll take 'em. All of\n'em.''\n\n   Before the day was over, they filled up Dr. Hoegemeyer's\nveterinary clinic with 41 dogs, every one of them only hours away\nfrom a fatal injection.\n\n   Back at the ranch, Nancy and Tony Simons, friends of Kinky who\ngot talked into running the ranch stared at the dogs. This is how\nthey named them:\n\n   Red dog, we'll call you Red.\n\n   Other red dog, you'll be Fred.\n\n   Third red dog, we'll name you Lucille Ball.\n\n   And on it went: There is Loretta (for Lynn); Carmella (she's\ncaramel-colored); Yoda (he's short and fat); and Little Bear (who\nhas lots of hair).\n\n   Tony and Nancy separated the dogs by size _ small, medium and\nlarge. The small and medium share the central pen with the picnic\ntable. Large dogs get the big run that stretches back behind the\nsingle-wide trailer.\n\n   Troublemakers get their own quarters, in the far pens under the\ncedar trees, where each cage is named in honor of Kinky's friends.\n\n   There's Fred the dog, who was separated because of heartworms,\nin the Lamar Smith pen. There's Hearty, an Australian cattle dog\nmix whose name is short for heartworms. He's in solitary\nconfinement in the Ann Richards pen because he's bad about jumping\nup on people. In the Willie Nelson pen, there's Molly the ring-eyed\ndog, who growls at people.\n\n   Then there are Spanky and Jack, the escape artists who got their\nown pen (with special wire netting around the top), and down at the\nend are Max the fighter, and Prissy, his mongrel moll.\n\n   Cousin Nancy is trying to explain how everything works, but\nshe's having to yell because Mr. Magoo, Kinky's Labrador retriever\nmutt, is taunting the other dogs. It seems he has a tennis ball,\nand they do not.\n\n   MORE\n\n   Nancy and Tony do the feeding. It takes 40 minutes and 55 pounds\nof Pedigree. They do the daily walks, and every afternoon, Nancy\nsets up ``Cousin Nancy's Beauty Parlor,'' a grooming session atop\nthe picnic table.\n\n   Nancy and Tony live in the trailer that sits beside the dog pens\nand overlooks the pond where the duck has resurfaced. Of course,\nNancy is not really Kinky's cousin. She's a friend from the 1970s,\nwhen he was a singer-songwriter and she embroidered hats and\njackets for Austin bands.\n\n   She knows that beneath the cigar-breathing, dirty-talking\ndemeanor is a man with a weak spot for the downtrodden. She and\nKinky did their first rescue together a few years back:\n\n   Kinky found a kitten on the side of the road. A hunter had shot\nit in the leg. It hissed when Kinky leaned in for a closer look.\nWell, Kinky picked it up anyway and brought it to the vet, who gave\nthe kitten two blood transfusions and amputated the leg. Then\nCousin Nancy took over, at Kinky's request, because he had to leave\non a book-signing tour. She named the three-legged cat Lucky.\n\n   That, Cousin Nancy says, tells you where Kinky is coming from.\n\n   If Kinky cared about being part of a trend, which he doesn't,\nhe'd have this to say, too:\n\n   Compassionate people put down so many dogs and cats last year _\n5 million nationwide _ that a bumper crop of alternative\norganizations is springing up to rescue animals from the rescue\nshelters. And his is one of them.\n\n   Although the number of dogs and cats ``put down,'' ``put to\nsleep,'' whatever you call it, has dropped in recent years, the\nnumbers are still sickening. There were 750,000 in Texas in 1997\n(39,000 in Fort Worth alone).\n\n   True, Americans are waiting until they are older and more\nsettled to get a pet, and true, 56 percent get their pets from\nshelters, and true, trends are encouraging in other parts of the\ncountry.\n\n   But in the South and Southwest, little has changed. In the Hill\nCountry, dogs are still dumped on two-lane roads, and litters of\nmewing kittens are still abandoned in ditches, and pounds can only\nkeep them so long.\n\n   Kinky and his celebrity friends didn't need statistics to tell\nthem that.\n\n   Kinky cajoled a rich friend, beauty supplier John McCall, into\npaying for 1,000 feet of chain-link fence. He shamed some other\nrich friends into giving him more money, and he persuaded friend\nAdri Brown to start a cat shelter four miles down the road. She\nnamed the first rescued cat after him. The Kinkster is a 13-pounder\nwho never shuts up.\n\n   Then there's his friend Copper Love. He talked her into helping\nmake the dogs adoptable. She's an animal trainer who worked in\nEurope but retired in Kerrville. Copper is working in the Ann\nRichards pen, soothing Hearty by rubbing his teeth. She's calming\nhim so they can work out his issues with jumping.\n\n   Currently, Kinky is schmoozing friend and country musician\nDwight Yoakam, aiming to get a benefit concert out of him before\nlong.\n\n   The goal is to find homes for every misfit here. Cousin Nancy\nand Tony interview adoptive parents. They have a clause in the\ncontract that says they can repossess the dog if they get wind of\nabuse or neglect.
