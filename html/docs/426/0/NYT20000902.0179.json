Gray\nDavis before becoming law, but already it has caught the eye of\nlawmakers elsewhere.\n\n   ``It will embolden other states,'' said Rep. Daniel Blue Jr. of\nNorth Carolina, a past president of the National Conference of\nState Legislators.\n\n   The Kansas City Star published stories in the spring showing\nthat police throughout the country use federal law enforcement\nagencies to evade state laws and keep drug money they seize.\n\n   Police give the drug money to a federal agency, which keeps 20\npercent or more and sends the rest back to the police department\nthat seized it.\n\n   Most state laws, however, prohibit seized property from going\ndirectly back to police.\n\n   Many state legislators are concerned that if police profit from\nfighting crime, they will be more aggressive in raising drug money\nrevenue, which could result in such problems as racial profiling\nand illegal searches and seizures.\n\n   State forfeiture laws also better protect civil liberties than\ndoes federal law, which does not even require a charge to be filed\nin order for property to be seized.\n\n   Police say they need to retain much of the money they seize in\norder to fight the war on drugs.\n\n   The California legislation would affect the way police handled\ntens of millions of dollars each year.\n\n   California law has allowed the seizing agency to keep about 50\npercent, with the rest going to such purposes as drug education and\nthe state's general fund. Instead, police have regularly used\nfederal agencies, which return up to 80 percent.\n\n   In just three years the federal government has returned more\nthan $92 million to California law enforcement agencies, much of\nthat from drug cases initiated by the state agencies, according to\nU.S. Department of Justice figures.\n\n   Now, for the first time, California would require police to\nadhere to state laws rather than federal laws when seizing property\nin drug cases.\n\n   ``The legislature here has spoken in a strong, bipartisan way,''\nsaid Sen. John Vasconcellos, the Public Safety Committee Chairman\nand a Santa Clara Democrat.\n\n   The most contentious provision, which attached a criminal\npenalty to police agencies that evaded the law, was dropped last\nweek after overwhelming complaints by police.\n\n   ``It's obnoxious to ask law enforcement to follow the law,''\nsaid John Lovell, lobbyist for the California police chief's\nassociation. ``That's insulting to every cop.''\n\n   The legislation passed Thursday would:\n\n   - Require a judge rather than the law enforcement agency to\ndecide when drug money should be turned over to a federal agency.\n\n   - Define the point at which police have actually ``seized''\nproperty. In Missouri, for example, police circumvent the state's\nforfeiture law by arguing that they have not seized property but\nare only holding it until a federal agency can take it. A bill is\npending to address that issue in Missouri.\n\n   - Require police officers to follow state law when seizing\nproperty even if they are deputized by a federal agency.\n\n   - Allow the state attorney general to sue police agencies if\nthey violated the law. A long fight\n\n   Forfeiture reform has been hard-fought in California.\n\n   Lawmakers passed a bill in 1994, but it did not include a\nprovision forcing police to follow state law.\n\n   A couple of years ago Sen. John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat\nand president pro tem, attempted to stop the flood of dollars to\nthe federal government with a bill requiring a judge's order to\ntransfer drug money to a federal agency. Law enforcement quickly\nmounted pressure, and Burton realized he did not have the backing\nof his colleagues at that time.\n\n   When the current legislation was filed earlier this year by\nVasconcellos, there was little initial reaction.\n\n   The bill quietly made its way through the Senate and the State\nAssembly committees. It was not until the last two weeks of the\nsession that the effect of the bill became clear to police, who\nwent into action.\n\n   Tim Yaryan, a lawyer who represents rank-and-file police in\nSouthern California, said the provision that made it a crime if a\npolice officer violated the law was like rubbing a pound of salt in\na wound.\n\n   ``Here we're having police officers who are doing their job and\ndoing what they're told to do, and they would potentially be\ncriminals,'' Yaryan said. ``That's horrible.''\n\n   Police lobbyists told legislative staff that they would take the\nfight to the governor and promised a veto unless the criminal\nprovision was removed.\n\n   With such loud opposition from one of the state's most powerful\nlobbies, that provision was discarded Wednesday.\n\n   Rand Martin, Vasconcellos' spokesman, said the law enforcement\nlobby was perceived to be powerful, even though it did not have\nmuch money at play in election campaigns. The lobby's power comes\nmore from politicians' fear that they could lose elections if they\nare seen as soft on crime.\n\n   So when law enforcement says to reject a bill, lawmakers tend to\nlisten, Martin said.\n\n   ``On an issue like this, where (police) are fearful of losing\nmoney, they turn up the heat more than they would normally,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Indeed, even after the bill was changed and passed, Lovell vowed\nthat police would go to Davis, the governor. Some lobbyists and\nlegislators speculated that Davis, considered a friend of law\nenforcement, would veto the legislation.\n\n   Roger Salazar, a Davis spokesman, said the governor had not yet\ndecided. Reform push grows\n\n   Legislators across the country think the California legislation\nwill have a big effect even if Davis vetoes it, because it shows\nlawmakers can pass such laws despite the law enforcement lobby.\n\n   In recent years few states have been successful in passing\nreform legislation, but several are now considering it.\n\n   Blue, of North Carolina, is closely watching developments\nbecause, although his state laws require forfeited drug money to go\nto public schools, little does.\n\n   Because the bill was passed in California, the country's most\npopulous state, legislators elsewhere will look at it, Blue said.\n\n   Blue said it was difficult politically for legislators to go\nagainst law enforcement. Ultimately, he believes, Congress will\nhave to shoulder the problem.\n\n   ``You will probably have to fix it at the federal level,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   One Utah legislator agreed that the California bill gave\nmomentum to other states, even if Davis were to exercise his veto\npower.\n\n   Rep. Bill Wright, an Elberta Republican and speaker pro tem,\nsaid it was recognized that many governors often became ``friends\nwith the cops'' through the election process.\n\n   ``You gain an association with them, and it becomes very\ndifficult to go against them,'' Wright said. ``A lot of (governors)\nknow it's right, but they just have a hard time standing up and\ncoming outside their loop.''\n\n   Utah has a voter initiative on the November ballot that would\nredirect money away from police to public schools and, like the\nCalifornia law, require a judge's approval to transfer drug money\nto a federal agency.\n\n   Police and prosecutors in Utah have joined forces to fight the\ninitiative, Wright said. Massachusetts and Oregon also have\ninitiatives aimed at reforming forfeiture laws.\n\n   A forfeiture bill pending in Missouri failed in the spring\nbecause of law enforcement pressure, but legislators hope to pass\nit early next year.\n\n   Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker pro tem, said law\nenforcement was damaging itself by fighting reform.\n\n   ``It is going to end up hurting them bad if it continues,'' said\nKreider, who is a co-sponsor of the bill. ``We don't want anything\nto hurt our finest.''\n\n   In Kansas, Rep. Ralph Tanner, a Baldwin City Republican, praised\nthe California Legislature. Tanner has researched the California\nbill as he is drafting one he plans to introduce in the next\nsession. He expects the bill to redirect drug money to education,\naway from law enforcement.\n\n   Tanner is talking to legislators, seeking support. He realizes\nthat some, as in California, will believe police should have\neverything they want.\n\n   Tanner said he had hopes that because of what California and\nMissouri had gone through, legislators in Kansas were awakening to\nthe idea that forfeiture reform had become necessary.\n\n   In California, Sen. Jim Costa, a Fresno Democrat and president\nof the National Conference of State Legislators, said top\nconference members would be meeting soon to determine their agenda\nfor the winter meeting in Washington. The forfeiture issue would be\nconsidered because it affects so many states, he said.  \n\n   ( 30 )\n","Headline":"\nNATION \n","Text":["\n   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Just a week ago a forfeiture-reform bill\nmoving through the California Legislature would have created the\nnation's toughest law regulating the way police handle drug money\nthey seize.\n","\n   By the time the bill passed _ by just two votes in the last\nhours of the session _ the reforms it offered were strong but more\nmodest.\n","\n   And in that, experts say, other states such as Kansas and\nMissouri that will soon eye their own reforms can draw two lessons:\n","\n   - Law enforcement has a powerful lobby.\n","\n   - It is possible to pass tougher forfeiture laws.\n","\n   Indeed, the California bill still must be signed by Gov.
