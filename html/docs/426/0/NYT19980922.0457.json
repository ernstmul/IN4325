Times News Service   \n\n   FUENGIROLA, Spain _ Like many of the British expatriates\nscattered around southern Spain, Cecilia Riber and her husband\nmoved to this coastal town when they retired, drawn to its warm\nclimate and relaxed way of life. But Riber died six years ago, and\nnow, after 15 years away from home, Mrs. Riber is ready to go back.\n\n   ``Basically, my family is starting to worry that I'm on my own\nhere, and I'm not getting any younger,'' she said.\n\n   But as eager as she is to return to England, Mrs. Riber, 68, is\none of a number of displaced Britons here and around Western Europe\nwho are caught in a strange sort of limbo, one that has forced them\nto weigh love of country against love of animals.\n\n   Under Britain's 77-year-old rabies law, if Mrs. Riber took her\nmixed-breed hound, Scruffy, back to England with her, he would be\nrequired to spend six months in quarantine, serving his time in\nsolitary confinement in one of the 80 or so kennels licensed by the\nBritish government. He wouldn't be allowed to play with other dogs.\nHe wouldn't be allowed to go for walks. And, Mrs. Riber says, she\njust won't do it to him.\n\n   ``I know I can't go back to England because he wouldn't be able\nto survive in a kennel for six months,'' Mrs. Riber said of\nScruffy, who is no youngster himself, nearing 13 and suffering from\nan enlarged heart that has left him short of breath and slow on his\nfeet. ``He's very important to me, particularly as I'm on my own\nnow. And that's why I'm staying here. I won't leave him. I can't\nleave him.''\n\n   There are people like Mrs. Riber all over southern Spain, in\nFrance, in the Netherlands, in Switzerland. The painter David\nHockney and the actor Rupert Everett, who are both British and live\nabroad, have refused to move back to England because of the rabies\nlaw. Probably the most famous anti-quarantine campaigner is\nChristopher Patten, Britain's last governor in Hong Kong, who moved\nback to London last year but left his beloved Norfolk terriers,\nWhisky and Soda, with dog-loving friends in France.\n\n   The quarantine law, which applies to all domestic mammals, dates\nfrom a time when rabies was a serious problem. But now, with the\ndisease eradicated in some parts of the world or kept at bay by\nvaccinations in others, anti-quarantine campaigners say it is time\nfor Britain to scrap its law. They are bitterly opposed by the\ncountry's $14.5 million-a-year quarantine kennel industry, which\nargues that it would be foolish to change a law that has been so\napparently successful (and so lucrative).\n\n   There are signs that years of anti-quarantine agitation, from\npeople both within and outside Britain, are finally, slowly paying\noff. On Sept. 23, a government-appointed committee of scientists is\nto issue a report that is expected to recommend a number of\nalternatives.\n\n   One possibility would be to institute a ``pet passport'' system,\nin which pets coming from the European Union and other rabies-free\nplaces would carry documentation proving they were healthy and had\nbeen inoculated against rabies. The system would entail placing\nelectronic chips under the animals' skin for easy identification.\n\n   Even if the government accepts the need for change, it will\nprobably be at least a year before anything actually happens, said\na spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,\nwhich administers the law. Until then, people like Mrs. Riber are\nsimply waiting.\n\n   ``My life is on hold,'' said Mrs. Riber, who sold her house and\nrented a temporary apartment recently. ``I'm leaving the minute the\nregulation is changed.''\n\n   Up in the hill town of Alhaurin el Grande, Elizabeth Collins put\nit a different way. ``I'll wait until he dies,'' she said, speaking\nof her dog, Sam, ``or, I guess, until the law changes.''\n\n   Sam, a mixed-breed dog with a strong suggestion of German\nshepherd, is ill and probably does not have much more than a year\nto live anyway, said Mrs. Collins, whose husband died recently and\nwho wants to go home to England. ``My daughter thinks I'm being\nsentimental, that a dog's a dog and I should just have him put\ndown,'' she said. ``But I say: `Sam's my friend. I wouldn't do that\nto him.'''\n\n   In desperation, more and more people are turning to smuggling to\nskirt the quarantine law. Some conceal their pets in bags or boxes\nand sneak them through the Channel Tunnel. Others pay professional\nsmugglers upward of several thousand dollars to bring the animals\nin by boat or truck.\n\n   ``It's surprisingly easy,'' said Peter Harrison, a British\nwriter and kennel operator here in Spain, who by way of testing the\nsystem recently flew to London carrying a box stamped ``Live\nAnimals,'' which he occasionally opened and put in food (no one\nstopped him).\n\n   Although as many as 10,000 dogs and cats are smuggled into\nBritain each year, according to one estimate, many people are\nreluctant to use this method.\n\n   John Nicholson said he would be afraid for the safety of Bella,\nhis Staffordshire bull terrier. He loves Bella so much that when he\nand his wife had a baby ``the opinion was that if Bella didn't get\non with the baby, then the baby was going.''\n\n   ``You don't know what kind of trauma she could go through,''\nsaid Nicholson, who runs a laundromat in a tourist enclave in El\nFaro. ``They can take them and just drop them in a hole\nsomewhere.''\n\n   Marie Dixon, a Briton who runs a poolside bar with her husband,\nBill, in the coastal town of Benalmadena, said of Major, her\n14-year-old retriever: ``Let's put it this way _ I'd be in a mental\ninstitution if anything happened to him.'' The Dixons have vowed\nnever to put Major back in quarantine after a traumatic stay a\ndecade ago when he came out emaciated and depressed, his spirit\nsubdued by the experience.\n\n   And so they remain in Spain, their dog having won out over their\nhome country. ``Look at it from his point of view,'' Dixon said.\n``Six months of a dog's life is a long time. You're putting him in\nprison for three and a half years, in his terms, and he's done\nnothing.''\n","Headline":"\nBRITONS PINE IN EXILE, EVER FAITHFUL TO THEIR DOGS \n","Text":["\n   FUENGIROLA, Spain _ Like many of the British expatriates\nscattered around southern Spain, Cecilia Riber and her husband\nmoved to this coastal town when they retired, drawn to its warm\nclimate and relaxed way of life.
