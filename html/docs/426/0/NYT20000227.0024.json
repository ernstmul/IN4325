They spell\nout rules: ``Three bullying threats: expulsion.'' They warn against\ndistributing drugs: ``Violators will be imprisoned.'' They list the\n``parole proof crimes: murder, rape, aggravated sodomy,'' for 12-\nthrough 14-year-old students to ponder on their way to class.\n\n   How many of their parents thought they'd see the words ``rape''\nand ``sodomy'' on middle school walls?\n\n   Shamrock is not a seedy, dangerous school _ far from it. If you\nturn from the signs to walk through the orderly classrooms, filled\nwith neatly dressed students, or stroll around the surrounding\nDecatur neighborhood of pleasant ranch houses, the signs seem even\nmore striking.\n\n   They are one glaring part of the fight to prevent heinous school\ncrimes like last spring's Columbine massacre in Littleton, Colo.\nJust last week, a 12-year-old pulled a loaded .380 handgun on\nanother student in the crowded cafeteria of a Fulton County middle\nschool. Many schools have resorted to scare signs or metal\ndetectors or surveillance cameras.\n\n   ``This is the way it is today,'' Shamrock Principal Tom Davis\nsays with regret, by way of explaining the scare-'em-straight signs\non his walls. ``It's nothing like when I was a kid in school.''\n\n   Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic,\nmay not offer the only _ or the best _ hope at preventing violence\nat school.\n\n   Shamrock and other schools, in addition to employing the\n``hardware approach,'' also have launched a new strategy to make\nschools both safer and happier in the long run: what might be\ncalled the human approach. This tack relies on less visible, but\nperhaps more effective measures, such as developing mentor\nprograms, broadening anti-bullying policies, bolstering the ranks\nof school psychologists and giving ``resource officers'' _ school\npolice _ the interpersonal skills of guidance counselors.\n\n   ``We can't search every knapsack in every car, wondering if\nthere might be a shooting in the parking lot before school,'' says\nBill Modzelski of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the\nU.S. Department of Education. ``So we have to depend on prevention\n_ getting to the roots of the problem. And that means awareness of\nthe kids' family structure, drug and alcohol problems, making sure\nsomeone takes responsibility to know if a child is happy or sad.\nSchools are so big now, kids pass through and nobody knows they're\nthere.''\n\n   HUMAN VS. HARDWARE\n\n   Metal detectors are uncommon in metro Atlanta, but they are\ncredited with sharply reducing violence in New York City. Warning\nsigns and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while\nthey may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an\noppressive air to schools.\n\n   Some students resent that cameras ``make everyone feel like a\nsuspect,'' in the words of an Illinois high school girl who sent an\ne-mail to a chat room on school violence. And the camera will never\nbe invented that can peer into a young person's mind. Witness the\nshooting at suburban Atlanta's Bear Creek Middle School, in 1994.\nOn camera, security officers actually saw one boy ambush another,\nwounding him in the knee, but it happened so fast there was nothing\nthat could be done to prevent it.\n\n   The locked-down mentality has even reached elementary schools.\nDr. Stephen Pastan, 43, of Atlanta was taking his children to his\nold private grade school in suburban Washington when a guard\nstopped him at the door, issued him I.D. tags and tried to make him\naccept an adult escort to tour the school.\n\n   ``It was like visiting IBM _ I was put off,'' Pastan says.\n``Maybe I'm naive about the real dangers but I worry about our\nchildren growing up without knowing what it is to feel free.''\n\n   In the chatroom run by the Raleigh-based Center for the\nPrevention of School Violence\n\n   (www.ncsu.edu/cpsv/), Chris Bresky, senior class president of\nClackamas (Ore.) High School, addressed the desire for a more human\napproach.\n\n   ``Metal detectors, cameras and K-9 task forces will not scare\nviolence away from the students, it will only scare the students;\nif the violence is in the students it will get inside the\nschools,'' Bresky writes. ``The key is to connect with students,\nraise awareness through speakers, plays, candlelight vigils that\nthere is violence out there and it can happen in their school.''\n\n   AN UNDERSTANDING EAR\n\n   Programs that stress the human approach are in effect to some\ndegree throughout the metro Atlanta area. But it's DeKalb County _\nwhich began a forceful anti-bullying policy in 1997, two years\nbefore it became state law _ that's building a national reputation\nfor innovation. The system's multifaceted security efforts were\nmentioned in Time magazine in the coverage of the Columbine\ntragedy, and are due to be spotlighted in a documentary on the A&E\nchannel in March.\n\n   Although the wall signs at Shamrock, a DeKalb County school,\nhelped curtail a bullying problem a few years ago, Garry McGiboney,\ndirector of student relations for DeKalb schools, says it's the\nless obvious, more subtle, human programs that will make the\nschools happier and safer in the long haul.\n\n   Russel Parris agrees. The Shamrock student's grades _ and\nattitude _ have improved since he's received weekly mentoring\nvisits at school from Fred Reese, an employee of a nearby BellSouth\noffice.\n\n   ``When I need to get something off my chest, my mentor's\nthere,'' says the 13-year-old, one of the 10 percent of Shamrock's\n1,057 students who are mentored. ``He tells me, `Don't get mad,\ndon't hit him, even if he was messing with you first.' It's good\nadvice.''\n\n   Jennifer Haygood, 13, adds: ``I can talk from the heart to my\nmentor, and I don't come in all mad-crazy wanting to blow up the\nschool.'' She smiles as she says this. She just means normal modern\nfrustration.\n\n   Principal Davis feels that mentoring helps students vent\nanxieties that might otherwise explode. ``That's one of the\nunderlying reasons we have a safe school,'' he says.\n\n   DEKALB'S INNOVATIONS\n\n   You could see the human approach at work at DeKalb's Soapstone\nCenter for the Arts the other day. A group of students age 9 to 18\nwas creating their own anger-management play to tour DeKalb\nschools. Just when the actors were about to erupt into staged\nfights, they stopped short _ took a deep breath, slipped on dark\nglasses and repeated the play's clever, cautionary tag line, ``Get\nin the cool zone!''\n\n   DeKalb schools have broadened the definition of bullying to\ninclude not just physical intimidation but ``any kind of harassment\nthat isolates a child,'' says DeKalb schools spokesman Spencer\nRagsdale. ``Teachers are trained to look not only for the obvious\nvictims of bullying, but to reach out to the kid who isn't picked\nfor teams, who eats lunch alone. That's where the pain starts.''\n\n   Policies on bullying are posted on the county's Web page\n(www.dekalb.k12 under ``What's New'') along with findings from a\nNorwegian study on bullying that was discovered on the Web.\n\n   DeKalb's school district also has been the most aggressive\nlocally in enforcing the new state anti-bullying law, expelling at\nleast 12 students since August and sending them for a semester or\ntwo to alternative schools where the student-teacher ratio is\nlower, and the number of psychology-based courses, such as\ndecision-making and anger management, is higher.\n\n   ``Kids have access to so much violent entertainment, spend so\nmuch time in a world where conflicts are resolved with a gun,''\nsays Kevin Dwyer of the National Association of School\nPsychologists. ``That's why adolescent bullying, which has always\nbeen with us, escalates so much more dangerously now than it did in\n1960 or even 1980.''\n\n   A CRUCIAL GAME OF HOOPS\n\n   The human approach to preventing violence is not limited to\nDeKalb. Across the nation, school cops are making more effort to\nconnect, to understand students' feelings, says Curt Lavarello,\nhead of the police officers' Florida-based national association.\n\n   Sean Burke, resource officer at Lawrence (Mass.) High School _\nwhere a girl recently slashed another girl's face with a knife _\ntells of joining in on an after-school basketball game and getting\nto know a boy who was almost frighteningly silent and intense.\nAfter months of gentle encouragement the boy revealed his secret:\nHe took off his shirt to display a back full of ugly welts.\n\n   There was more. The father who whipped him also had sexually\nabused him.\n\n   Burke, his voice cracking with emotion, says, ``There's\ntremendous pressure in these kids today. You need to help them get\nit out.''\n\n   Connecting with students who hurt and healing them is more\nlikely to occur when psychologists are a visible force in the\nschools, says Dwyer.\n\n   Dwyer, author of a widely respected study on the warning signs\nfor school violence, says that when there is a ratio of at least\none psychologist per thousand students _ as there are in only six,\nmostly northeastern states _ the reductions in violence are\nconsiderable.\n\n   The high ratio of psychologists and their active involvement in\nthe curriculum of Tampa schools, under the banner Project Achieve,\nwas credited for reducing violent incidents in those schools by 80\npercent.\n\n   Georgia ranks in the middle of the states, with about one\npsychologist per 2,000 students.\n\n   It's the victims of bullies _ not the bullies themselves _ who\nare most likely to commit the high-profile acts of school violence,\nDeKalb's McGiboney has found.\n\n   ``The common thread in these incidents is that the child feels\nisolated or ostracized,'' he says. ``That feeling may begin at\nhome. A 13-year-old kid left in his room with a ton of\nentertainment equipment, or dropped at the mall to hang out all\nafternoon _ that's not independence. That's isolation. Parents need\nto talk to their kids and offer support before that anger grows.''\n\n   Indeed, reaching parents _ persuading them that bullying isn't a\nnecessary rite of passage to toughen a kid's hide _ is almost as\nbig a challenge as reaching students, McGiboney says. When\naddressing parents' groups, he begins by asking how many were\nbullied as youngsters, and almost everyone's hand goes up.\n\n   ``Then I ask, `How many still think about that bullying today?'\nand nearly every hand stays up,'' McGiboney says. ``I think that\nmakes my point.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DECATUR, Ga. _ If you walk into the middle of Shamrock Middle\nSchool wearing a blindfold, then take it off to study the signs on\nthe corridor walls, you might think you're in the heart of\nscholastic darkness.\n","\n   The signs warn students to stay in line _ or else.
