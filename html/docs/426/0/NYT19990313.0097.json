Times News Service    \n\n   In cities and towns across the nation, a chorus of politically\ninfluential voices cries out in unison: Woof!\n\n   From leash laws to legislation to curb dangerous animals to\nregulations limiting the number of dogs per household, canine\nquestions have become the new hot button of local politics. In New\nYork City, an effort to curb leashlessness escalated this month as\narmed police were brought into what had been a Parks Department\noffensive; 450 summonses have been issued in the last two weeks.\nDog owners compare themselves to Jews under Hitler, while the parks\ncommissioner snarls about ``dog terrorists.'' The city will soon\npass out cell phones to volunteers to snitch on leash violators.\n\n   Emotions are equally pitched in Avon, Conn., where dog owners\nare in revolt over not being able to let dogs run freely in a large\npark. In Boston, pooper-scooper laws are a flashpoint. In Venice\nBeach, Calif., a ban on dogs on the boardwalk is the issue. In St.\nPetersburg, Fla., it is the process of determining which dogs are\ntoo vicious to live. In Cheektowaga, N.Y., pooch lovers seethe at\nthe legal limit of three dogs per household. In Annapolis, Md., and\nHighland Park, Mich., owners are infuriated over bans on pit bulls.\n\n   In Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco and scores more cities,\npeople scream for more dog space in city parks. In Santa Fe, N.M.,\nlast year, a resident filed a $2 million suit against the city,\ncharging ``Gestapo-style'' enforcement of the leash law.\n\n   Dog politics is decidedly local: State laws have little to say\nabout regulating Rover, and Washington almost nothing. The fight is\nover local regulations, and it occurs in city, town and village\ncouncils. But, according to the March issue of Governing, which\ntracks trends in local government, the fights have all too much in\ncommon.\n\n   ``A seemingly innocuous proposal is quickly followed by a\nresponse stunningly disproportionate to its weightiness in the\npublic policy arena,'' it said. ``If you thought taxes were the\nonly issue that made voters' blood boil, then you haven't had a dog\nissue appear on the public agenda lately.''\n\n   Because of the high-pitched emotions and the sharp polarization,\nparticipants often liken dog issues to abortion. ``There is no\nmiddle ground,'' said Fred Marquis, administrator of Pinellas\nCounty, Fla., where the heated discussion has been over how to\ndetermine if a dog is dangerous and worthy of being impounded. ``As\nwith abortion, people are either totally opposed or totally\nsupportive.''\n\n   Carol Lea Benjamin, a former dog trainer who now writes novels\nabout a detective who is accompanied by a pit bull, agreed:\n``There's no way you can have a calm discussion about this with\nanybody. It's like talking about religion. At the end of 10 hours,\nnobody's mind is going to be changed.''\n\n   The controversies are not fueled by an increase in dogs.\nAlthough the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association\nexpects an increase in a census it is now preparing, the estimated\nnumber of dogs in the country two years ago, 54.6 million, was\nvirtually the same as in 1988.\n\n   What has changed, according to James Weverka, president of the\nNational Animal Control Association, is that dogs in recent years\nhave gotten larger, are more likely to be guard dogs and tend to be\nconfined in smaller spaces by working people who spend less time\nwith them. Upshot: dogs that seem more threatening roam limited\npublic spaces, whose owners are more likely to treat them\nindulgently.\n\n   Moreover, Weverka _ who serves as animal control manager in\nLincoln, Neb., where a dog catcher was recently beaten by an irate\nowner _ says the view of dogs has changed fundamentally from the\ntime when they were prized for herding or hunting. The increase in\nthe number of people living alone, including older people whose\nchildren have left the roost, may be a factor. ``There's now a\nfeeling that dogs are members of the family,'' he said. ``A member\nof the family would never bite or attack.''\n\n   The love people feel for their furry best friends is suggested\nby the stuff the 28.5 million dog owners buy their pets as\nChristmas presents. A new apartment tower being built in\nManhattan's Tribeca neighborhood will offer a ``doggie bar,'' with\nwater and treats for pups, and ``doghouse room service,'' providing\nmilk, bottled water and gourmet dog food. The feeling is almost\nparental: Ms. Benjamin says that in 20 years as a dog trainer, she\nroutinely addressed owners as mommy or daddy, and was never\ncorrected. But to psychiatrists the attachments may be deeper\nstill.\n\n   Dr. Kenneth Skodnek, chairman of the psychiatry and psychology\ndepartment at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y.,\nsuggested that dog owners perceive their pets as an extension of\nthemselves. ``They take everything the pet does or doesn't do very\npersonally,'' he said. ``If the pet is criticized, they feel\ncriticized.'' But he said it may be more than even that. ``Pet\nowners allow their pets to do things they wouldn't do themselves,''\nhe said. ``The pet gives them a chance to feel free.''\n\n   Such feelings add ferocity and flair to the dog owners'\npresentations. At an Avon, Conn., town meeting last summer, more\nthan 400 showed up with leashes around their necks. They called a\nplan to bar dogs from running free in 230-acre Fisher Meadows Park\na crime against nature, and vowed disobedience. But the ban was\nsupported in a September referendum. Now, Phil Schenck, the town\nmanager, wants to bring the warring groups together, perhaps to\nfind some smaller park area where dogs can go at certain times.\n``You need to take the emotion out of it,'' he said.\n\n   Supporters of the ban are clearly in the majority, Schenck said.\nSimilarly, the New York City Parks Department says that user\nsurveys of parks favored by dog users show that most people in the\nparks do not come with dogs; it adds that mail is running more than\n3-to-1 in favor of its crackdown. In particular, people are irked\nthat dog owners berate low-paid park rangers, often minorities, as\nNazis, give them names like Eva Braun and exultantly unleash their\ndogs after an enforcer goes around the corner. A typical letter:\n``I have yet to see a dog owner take anything other than a position\nof righteous indignation when someone objected.''\n\n   The ultimate question, perhaps, is what is a dog? Under English\ncommon law, dogs were considered valueless, mere providers of\npleasure as opposed to livestock, which were considered property.\nBut thinkers from Homer to Freud have invested canines with deeper\nimportance _ in the same vein as today's dog defenders.\n\n   New York City's ultimate aim is not to eliminate pooches but\npersuade people to look down on leash-law violators _ just as\npeople now complain about smokers in restaurants. ``Unleashed dogs\nare violating human rights,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern,\nowner of Boomer the (leashed) Wonder Dog.\n","Headline":"\nPOLITICAL ANIMALS: GROWLING OVER DOGS' RIGHTS \n","Text":["\n   In cities and towns across the nation, a chorus of politically\ninfluential voices cries out in unison: Woof!\n","\n   From leash laws to legislation to curb dangerous animals to\nregulations limiting the number of dogs per household, canine\nquestions have become the new hot button of local politics.
