By STEPHEN LABATON   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ When he entered the private investigation business\nnearly 20 years ago, James J. Rapp opened a company to do\nsurveillance and other things that he did not want to talk about,\nparticularly because its name, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, aptly\ndescribed its operations.\n\n   Now Rapp, a 39-year-old investigator who used to promise on his\nWeb page that he could quickly get anyone's private telephone\nrecords or bank account balances for as little as $100, is in the\nmiddle of legislative, regulatory and criminal battles over how\nmuch privacy millions of Americans should enjoy when they go to the\nbank or make a phone call.\n\n   Rapp has made a career of posing as the person whose records he\nis trying to uncover, to trick banks, telephone companies and other\ninstitutions into revealing confidential information sought by his\nclients. The practice is known in the trade as pretexting, and it\nhas drawn a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission that names\nRapp, his wife, Regana, and their company, Touch Tone Information\nInc. A trial date has not been set, although Touch Tone has agreed\nto honor a preliminary injunction barring the investigative\npractices that are at issue in the suit.\n\n   The lawsuit is billed by both sides as a landmark case, and Rapp\nis receiving significant support from a coalition of information\nbrokers and debt collectors who see the government's action as a\npotential threat to their livelihood. But even some of his allies\nare uneasy about using Rapp as the vehicle to avoid new and tougher\ngovernment privacy rules, because he has a criminal record and\nserved a four-year prison sentence for theft.\n\n   The case against Rapp has also been discussed in Congress as\nlawmakers in both the House and Senate, with the support of the\nClinton administration, are trying to make such investigative\ntechniques a federal crime and impose new civil liabilities on\npractitioners of the art of deceiving banks. He is being\ninvestigated by a grand jury in Colorado under a new state law that\nmakes it a crime to use deceptive practices to obtain private\ninformation.\n\n   In a separate lawsuit filed in 1996, he was alleged to have\nhelped a client, the International Beverage Corp., obtain telephone\nrecords of a competitor, Saybrex International, from AT&T as part\nof an effort by International Beverage to learn who Saybrex's\ncustomers were. Saybrex, a family-run liquor exporter in Beverly\nHills, Calif., ultimately successfully sued the competitor _ though\nnot Rapp, who was not named as a defendant in the suit. Saybrex,\nhowever, was unable to force AT&T to tighten its procedures for\nhanding out customer records.\n\n   In a recent series of interviews, Rapp and his lawyers said\nthere was nothing inherently wrong with using trickery to get\nconfidential information, particularly since that information is\noften not otherwise obtainable. They also said that Rapp had\ncracked many cases in which deception was the only way to find\nmoney for victims of crimes and neglect, like abandoned spouses and\nchildren, and for plaintiffs in lawsuits who were unable to collect\njudgments, and for insurance companies and banks that had been\ndefrauded.\n\n   ``The message that the government is sending in its case is that\nif you're a deadbeat dad, you don't have to worry any more,'' Rapp\nsaid. ``After all, how else are you going to get at this\ninformation?''\n\n   Rapp has his defenders, and is even cited as an exemplar by an\nindustry group of investigators and debt collectors who so far have\nbeen moderately successful in watering down proposed legislation\nand obtaining significant loopholes for certain kinds of cases,\nsuch as tracking down assets for child support payments. The group,\nthe Coalition to Amend the Financial Information Privacy Act, is\npaying for Rapp's legal defense in the FTC case _ and using him to\nhelp raise money for its lobbying efforts.\n\n   The coalition's members maintain that the practice of pretexting\nis no different from what police officers or some journalists do\nwhen they go undercover or assume false identities in the course of\ndoing their jobs.\n\n   Critics of the information brokers say that publicly available\ndata bases and computer services offer a variety of information\nabout people and their finances, including their Social Security\nnumbers, the prices they paid for their homes and any existing\nliens. They note that other information, like bank deposits, can be\nobtained when necessary through a court subpoena.\n\n   But Rapp and his supporters say that information like bank and\ntelephone records is generally not publicly available, that it can\nchange quickly during the time it takes to get a judge's order, and\nthat the only way money can be recovered in many instances is by\nduping a financial institution.\n\n   ``What our clients are trying to do is even the odds,'' said\nStephen C. Leckar, a lawyer at the Washington firm Butera &\nAndrews, which is representing both the coalition and Rapp. ``If\nsome people don't pay their bills, investigators like Rapp are just\nleveling the playing field.''\n\n   But the FTC sees it as privacy issue.\n\n   ``Touch Tone's pretexting is a particularly pernicious invasion\nof consumers' privacy _ using deception to gain access to\nsensitive, private financial information,'' Robert Pitofsky, the\nFTC's chairman, said. ``This case should send a strong message to\ninformation brokers that the FTC will pursue firms that use false\npretenses at the expense of consumers' privacy and also create\nopportunities for economic injury to consumers.''\n\n   The banking industry is caught in the middle. On the one hand,\nit has publicly denounced the deceptive techniques and called for\nsome new legislation, although it has also tried to make sure that\nany new laws do not create new liabilities for the banks that might\nbe too quick about turning over confidential information. On the\nother hand, many of the clients of investigators like Rapp have\nbeen banks seeking to collect delinquent loans.\n\n   ``There's little question that some banks will hire information\nbrokers,'' said John Byrne, a senior counsel at the American\nBankers Association and an expert on privacy issues. ``We have\ntried to emphasize that banks should ask questions about how they\nare getting information and that there are legitimate means of\ngetting at the same stuff.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Court papers in both the Saybrex and FTC lawsuits describe Rapp\nand his employees as using fake telephone numbers and phony\ncorporations to deceive banks or telephone companies into turning\nover confidential information.\n\n   In the FTC case, transcripts of calls to banks that were\nrecorded as part of the government's surveillance revealed Touch\nTone employees pretending to be doddering customers in order to\nobtain Social Security numbers and other information, like the\nmaiden name of an account holder's mother. In some cases, bank\nrepresentatives declined to help. But in others, they guided the\nTouch Tone employee to the correct answer and even supplied\ninformation like account balances.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Private investigators familiar with the deceptive practices of\ninformation brokers say another common technique is the ``Trojan\ncheck.'' The broker sets up a dummy corporation and sends a check\nfor a small amount of money to the target of the investigation\neither as a supposed rebate or award. When the target deposits or\ncashes the check, information about the target's bank account is\nimprinted on the canceled check. The broker can then use that\ninformation to approach the bank.\n\n   The legislation and legal fights come as Washington has become\ncaptivated by privacy issues and the rights of consumers and the\nbusinesses that hold their confidential records, from insurance\ncompanies and hospitals to banks and telephone companies.\n\n   Late last week, the House Commerce Committee inserted a variety\nof consumer privacy protections into the latest version of\nlegislation to overhaul the nation's banking system. Those\nproposals, which were endorsed by consumer groups and include a new\nright to sue companies that violate their customers' privacy\nrights, threatens to undermine broad industry support for the\nlegislation.\n\n   Experts say it is not clear whether the broadly worded existing\nfederal fraud laws would permit the criminal prosecution of a\nperson who deceives an institution to gain access to private\ninformation, which is why Congress may act this year to make the\nlaw more explicit.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n        On the Web pages and court papers of the coalition supporting\nRapp, he is portrayed as a victim of an overzealous federal agency,\nan agency that if it prevails will make it more difficult for\nabandoned wives and their children to find desperately needed\nassets of their deadbeat dads.\n\n   But even as Rapp has become the industry's poster boy for what\nthe coalition has called a ``witch hunt'' by federal regulators, it\nturns out that he has had his own more serious difficulties with\nthe law.\n\n   Rapp served four years in prison in the 1970s and    '   80s in\nColorado for theft, which was a violation of his probation on an\nearlier conviction for auto theft. State records in Denver show\nthat in 1992 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a peace officer. He\nand his wife have had more than $38,000 in tax liens imposed by the\nfederal government for failing to pay taxes.\n\n   The industry's using him as their symbol ``is like bankers\nembracing Jesse James,'' said Marshall B. Grossman, a Los Angeles\nlawyer who represents Saybrex.\n\n   Because he is a man who has made a career out of deception, it\ncan be difficult to sort through the substance of many of Rapp's\nclaims.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   He said in an interview that the investigations and the poor\nhealth of his parents had driven him out of business in recent\nweeks, a business that he said had annual revenue of about $1\nmillion for the last few years.\n\n   He said there was nothing wrong with employing deception to get\nat private information and that his clients over the years had\nincluded banks, tabloid newspapers and television programs. He\nasserted that he had probably trained half of the nation's\ninformation brokers, had solved ``over 100 cases a day'' and that\nhe worked for private investigators hired to get information for\nnews organizations about the families of the victims of the\nColumbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo.\n\n   He also said he had done work for agents at two field offices of\nthe FBI, but he refused to provide any references or say anything\nmore about the work.\n\n   Many of his assertions could not be verified.\n\n   He also asserted that he had received an ``associate's degree''\nin criminal justice from Metropolitan State College in Denver.
