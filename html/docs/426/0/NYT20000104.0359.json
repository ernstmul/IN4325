Times News Service    \n\n   It suddenly became easier yesterday to browse for air fares,\nhotel room rates and other business services on Expedia.com, the\nmost heavily used online booking engine for leisure and business\ntravel.\n\n   The company dropped the requirement that visitors must register\nand provide basic personal information before using the site to\nshop for fares and other rates.\n\n   The move came three days after the nation's leading retailer,\nWal-Mart Stores, launched its own travel-booking engine as part of\nan ambitious expansion of its Web shopping site. The new Wal-Mart\ntravel-booking engine does not require users to register first.\n\n   ``It's a fundamental shift in the way we're looking at things,''\nsaid Erik Blachford, the vice president of marketing for Expedia\nInc., a subsidiary of Microsoft, which has become the leader in the\nfree-for-all world of online travel booking. ``We decided that we\nwere turning away a lot of people who weren't comfortable with\nregistration. It was an unnecessary barrier, so we just decided we\nwould get rid of it.''\n\n   Blachford said that Expedia's decision to drop the registration\nrequirement was not prompted by Wal-Mart's entry into the field.\n\n   ``Wal-Mart didn't really enter into this decision at all,'' he\nsaid. ``I mean, I'm aware that they just put up their site, but it\ndidn't have any effect on our decision. This is something we did in\nresponse to what our customers have been telling us.''\n\n   Studies have shown that the registration procedures typically\nrequired by online booking services and other internet commerce\nsites are a strong disincentive to many users, who ``just turn\naround and go away,'' Blachford said, when they are asked to\nprovide basic personal information like a name and e-mail address\nbefore getting access to the information on a site.\n\n   Online commerce companies usually hold their registration\ndatabases in high regard as an indication that their potential\ncustomers are committed enough to provide personal information. But\nBlachford said that Expedia decided to concentrate instead on\ndirect booking revenue and the sheer number of ``hits'' that the\nsite received.\n\n   ``You know, the more we looked at it the more we realized that\nthe value that people are putting on these registration databases\nis hugely overstated,'' he said.\n\n   During the five-week Christmas shopping period, Expedia was the\nninth most heavily visited e-commerce Web site, according to Media\nMetrix, which compiles Internet traffic data. In 1998, Expedia had\nretail travel sales of $250 million, up from $100 million the year\nbefore. Analysts have estimated that Expedia's sales will exceed\n$500 million for 1999.\n\n   Melisa Berryhill, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said that the\nretail giant had carefully designed its Web site to encourage\npeople to browse easily.\n\n   ``Our goal in the first year is to earn our customers' trust for\ntheir travel needs,'' she said. ``We wanted to start by keeping it\nvery simple. We look to evolve it from there. People do not need to\nregister before using our site.''\n\n   Expedia's Blachford said that while Wal-Mart was a potential\ncompetitor down the line in the growing online travel business,\n``we tend to look at the Wal-Mart travel site as an aisle in the\nWal-Mart store. Most people don't want want to buy their travel\nfrom an aisle in a store.''\n\n   JetBlue Is Set to Fly\n\n   JetBlue Airways, one of the most ambitious airline start-ups\never, is prepared to start operations next month with low-cost\nflights out of New York's Kennedy International Airport.\n\n   ``Pending final government approval, our first flights are Feb.\n11, a double inauguration schedule to Fort Lauderdale and\nBuffalo,'' said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman for the\nairline, which is based in New York and plans to advertise fares\nthat average about 65 percent less than competitors on a route\nschedule that will include about a dozen cities by the end of this\nyear.\n\n   The airline, which ultimately plans a fleet of 82 new Airbus\nA-320 aircraft, plans to stress low fares, on-board comfort and\nhigh-technology services like automated check-in and television\nmonitors with in-flight satellite-TV broadcasts for every seat. New\nWeek, when tickets go on sale, fares for the initial destinations\nwill be announced. Edmondson-Jones said yesterday that one-way\nfares to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., would start at $79, and to Buffalo\nat $49.\n\n   While many start-up airlines have failed, analysts tracking the\nlaunch of JetBlue have been impressed with its $130 million in\nequity capitalization, partly financed by the investor George\nSoros. Eventually, the company hopes to offer flights to cities\nthroughout the East Coast, as well and to some destinations in the\nMidwest and Southwest.
