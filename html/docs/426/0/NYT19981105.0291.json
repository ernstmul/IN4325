The suit seeks to\nstop a $25 million Lycos Inc. ad campaign featuring a barking dog\nidentified as ``Lycos, the Internet retriever.''\n\n   It's easy to see why both companies want to use the image of a\nhunting dog _ they both make products that hunt through vast\namounts of computer data for specific pieces of information. The\nLycos search engine features an index of millions of Internet\nsites. Labrador makes a computer program called ``E-Retriever,''\nwhich uses simple keywords rather than lengthy Internet addresses\nto find information on an Internet site or corporate network.\n\n   Labrador officials concede they have never trademarked their\nname and logo. But they say they have used both since 1996, in\nhonor of a dog owned by the firm's cofounders, brothers John and\nJoe Furrier.\n\n   ``On the strong advice of our attorneys, we felt that we had to\nprotect our corporate name, our brand,'' said Joe Furrier,\nLabrador's vice president of sales and marketing.\n\n   Victor Polk, Labrador's attorney in the case, says that\ntrademark law does not require formal registration. ``The law is\nthat people who use in commerce a mark, a name to identify\nthemselves, have priority over people who then come later,'' said\nPolk.\n\n   Lycos's adoption of the retriever image has blurred Labrador's\nimage in the computer industry, Polk claimed. ``We've gotten 12\nphone calls from people in the industry asking, `Have you done a\ndeal with Lycos?''' he said.\n\n   Bob Davis, president of Lycos, scoffed at the lawsuit. ``To me\nit's frivolous to the highest order,'' he said.\n\n   Davis rejects the argument that Labrador's       company name gives\nit the right to stop other Internet firms from using the word\n``retriever'' in their ads. He also noted that there's little\nresemblance between the retriever images used by Lycos and by\nLabrador.\n\n   ``Why don't they sue Taco Bell while they're at it?'' he asked.\n``They use a dog.''\n\n        Davis predicted that the Labrador suit would be summarily\ndismissed.\n\n   Lycos is based in Waltham, Mass.\n","Headline":"\nSOFTWARE FIRM SUES LYCOS OVER USE OF DOG IMAGE \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ A dogfight over a Labrador retriever has landed\nInternet search service Lycos in federal court.\n","\n   Labrador Software Inc. of Danvers, Mass. filed a trademark\ninfringement suit Thursday in US District Court.
