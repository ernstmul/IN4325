Enterprising Turks began to\ntrade in dogs, tripling the Russians' prices but still offering\nfurry bargains to middle-class Turks.\n\n   Pet shops proliferated: there are now 40 or so in Ankara, the\ncapital, alone, plus 60 dog clinics and three ``dog hotels'' in\ncase owners have to go away.\n\n   The sales boom has given a boost to animal-rights groups, and\npoliticians have also spotted the trend. New laws to make\nmaltreatment of animals a crime are going through parliament.\n\n   There was a burst of public debate this month when it emerged\nthat fur trappers were using meat laced with arsenic to lure foxes\nto their doom.\n\n   The latest posters of Mesut Yilmaz, Turkey's recently deposed\nprime minister, who hopes to get his job back after the election\ndue in April, display him alongside not just his family but also\nhis Great Dane, Daisy.\n\n   A popular television program has even shown Turkey's would-be\n``first dog'' going into labor and then basking with her new pups:\nvote-catchers, so Yilmaz hopes, all seven of them.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 400-word article, it must be purchased from the\nNew York Times Syndicate in New York at 1-800-972-3550 or\n212-499-3333, or fax us at 212-499-3382.)      \n      \n   (EDITORS: Please note that this article is NOT available to clients\nin Canada EXCEPT to The Toronto Globe & Mail.)     \n","Headline":"\nWHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU MIX A DOG AND TURKEY?...ISTANPOODLE  \n \n","Text":["\n   ANKARA _ Those who criticize Turkey's human-rights record can\ntake some comfort from the fact that Turks seem to be treating\nanimals better than they used to.\n","\n   Last week the story of a collie abandoned in the Aegean port of\nIzmir was splashed on the front page of a mass-circulation\nnewspaper, Hurriyet.
