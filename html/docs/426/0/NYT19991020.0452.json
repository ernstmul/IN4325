In fact, the FTC said, the company kept the names and\naddresses of the children along with their responses.\n\n   Businesses can use personal information to fashion\nadvertisements that appeal to specific audiences and then, through\nthe unique medium of the Internet, present the ads to those groups\nby e-mail or on Web sites.\n\n   While many companies changed some of their most aggressive\npractices after regulators intervened, Congress last year issued\nnew rules for soliciting information from children and asked the\nFederal Trade Commission to set specific requirements.\n\n   In the rules issued Wednesday, which take effect in April, the\nFTC said that companies must ask for parental permission in many\ncases before seeking information from children.\n\n   When companies plan to make the information public through chat\nrooms or other Internet activities, they must seek parental\npermission by mail, fax, toll-free phone line or by electronic mail\nmessage in which the parent attaches a digital signature or\npassword. Companies must also use these methods if they plan to\ndisclose the personal information to business partners. These\nmethods are considered more secure than merely asking a parent to\nsend approval by e-mail, which could be forged by a child.\n\n   When companies seek personal information for internal use to\nmarket products and services to children via e-mail, they may ask a\nparent to send an e-mail giving consent.

And companies may enter a child in a\ncontest or send an e-mail newsletter as long as the parent receives\nnotice and can prevent further use of the child's information.\n\n   Consumer and business groups were generally enthusiastic about\nthe rules, though they were cautious about some provisions.\n\n   ``Overall, we are pleased,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president\nof the Center for Media Education, which had complained to the FTC\nabout some company practices. She said the government had acted\nwisely to post rules early, while on-line marketing is still\ndeveloping as a business.\n\n   Business groups had lobbied hard against the requirement that\nthey seek parental consent by phone, fax or mail, which they said\nwould be costly for Internet start-ups. But most said they were\ngenerally happy with the FTC rules.\n\n   The phone or mail requirement ``is going to be a sticking point\nfor some, but I think that marketers are going to be able to live\nwith it _ not without some effort,'' said Hal Shoup of the American\nAssociation of Advertising Agencies. ``But nonetheless, given the\ncomplexity of the issues, what has been worked out here is on\nbalance quite good.''\n\n   Consumer groups said they had concerns about a provision that\nallows schools to act on behalf of parents in giving consent for\ncompanies to seek personal information from children.\n\n   They noted that rules were released on the same day as the\ninitial public stock offering of ZapMe!, a company that provides\nfree computers and an online service to schools in return for the\nright to post Web ads. Some consumer advocates cautioned that\nschools were essentially allowing companies to set up shopping\nmalls in the classroom through the Internet.\n\n   The computer can become ``a surveillance device that collects\ninformation and exposes (students) to extremely targeted and\nintrusive advertising,'' said Jason Catlett, president of\nJunkbusters Corp., which offers products to filter unwanted postal\nmail, e-mail and telemarketing calls.\n\n   Catlett said that schools that are eager to receive free\ncomputers might not properly guard students' privacy. ``Parents\nshouldn't assume that schools are looking out for the privacy\nconcerns of their children . . . .
