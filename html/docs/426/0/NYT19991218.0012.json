Ressam was arrested in Port\nAngeles, Wash., after he drove off a ferry from Victoria, B.C.\n\n   He had reserved a room at a Seattle hotel near the landmark\nSpace Needle, but intended to stay in the United States only a day\nbefore flying to London.\n\n   Law enforcement sources could not identify possible bombing\ntargets Friday night.\n\n   Authorities apparently are searching for a second man who was\nwith Ressam for several weeks in Vancouver, B.C.\n\n   Agents, in a stroke of luck, arrested Ressam in Port Angeles on\nTuesday night and found in his rented car liquid nitroglycerin and\n118 pounds of urea, a component of fertilizers and explosives that\nwas used in the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.\n\n   ``You're definitely going to take a building out with this\nstuff,'' a military explosives expert told the Post-Intelligencer\non Friday.\n\n   Urea produces a slow explosion said to be ideal for destroying\nconcrete structures, federal officials said.\n\n   The diminutive Ressam made an appearance in federal court in\nSeattle on Friday under high security. He was charged with bringing\nnitroglycerine into the United States from Canada and with making\nfalse statements to U.S. Customs Service inspectors.\n\n   During proceedings that were translated into Arabic, Federal\nMagistrate David Wilson ordered Ressam to appear Wednesday for a\ndetention and preliminary hearing. He will be in federal custody\nuntil then.\n\n   Security was so tight at the courthouse that anyone entering _\neven employees _ had to produce photo identification. U.S. marshals\nblocked the door to Wilson's courtroom and armed officers patrolled\nthe streets as Ressam was brought to the courthouse.\n\n   The case began as a Customs investigation that ultimately\nbrought in the Border Patrol and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco and Firearms. By Friday, the FBI and CIA had taken over.\n\n   Ressam first entered the United States on Feb. 7, when he flew\nto Los Angeles from Seoul. He showed up again this fall on a flight\nfrom Quebec to British Columbia, where he lived in a motel 15\nminutes from downtown Vancouver.\n\n   He and a second man checked into the 65-unit 2400 Motel in East\nVancouver in late November, stayed about three weeks, and checked\nout one day last week, said a desk clerk who identified herself\nonly as Joanne.\n\n   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police questioned motel workers\nWednesday about Ressam and the man who checked in and out with him,\nshe said.\n\n   Both were clean-shaven, slender and spoke English with what\nseemed to be a French accent. ``There was just nothing about them,\nno distinguishing marks or anything, that stands out,'' she said.\n\n   Ressam rented a car in Canada and crossed into the United States\non Tuesday aboard the Coho, a privately run ferry between Victoria\nand Port Angeles. His rented Chrysler was the last auto on the\nferry.\n\n   He became so nervous that his hands reportedly shook when\nCustoms inspectors questioned him upon arrival in Port Angeles.\nInspectors were curious because he was headed for Seattle and had\ntaken an out-of-the-way route to get there.\n\n   He had a passport, Quebec driver's license and several credit\ncards in the name of Benni Noris and a second Quebec driver's\nlicense in the name of Mario Roig, according to court documents.\n\n   Customs inspectors searched the trunk of his car and found in\nthe spare-tire well 10 plastic bags of a fine white powder, two\nplastic bags of a crystalline powder and two 22-ounce jars that\nwere three-quarters full of a yellowish liquid, according to court\ndocuments. A federal agent also said the liquid contained sawdust,\nwhich is sometimes used to pack nitroglycerine.\n\n   They also found four black boxes, each containing a circuit\nboard, digital watch and 9-volt battery connector.\n\n   Ressam fled when the material was discovered. He ran up to the\ndoor of a passing car but the woman driver sped off and Customs\ninspectors tackled Ressam.\n\n   A Washington State Patrol laboratory identified the fine white\npowder as urea, the liquid as nitroglycerine and the crystalline\npowder as a sulfate used to absorb water. The laboratory in Tacoma,\nWash., described the tested samples of nitroglycerine as extremely\nvolatile and explosive.\n\n   Friday, Wilson ordered the remainder of the liquid to be\ndestroyed despite objections from Ressam's federal public defender\nthat the defense had not been able to test it.\n\n   Law enforcement agencies throughout the nation have been warned\nabout possible terrorism attacks as 2000 approaches. The federal\ngovernment has included Algeria as a possible source of terrorism.\n\n   However, law enforcement officials said the arrest in Port\nAngeles was the result of good fortune.\n\n   ``It was essentially a cold hit, so we're starting at ground\nzero,'' said a federal law enforcement source. ``We're looking for\nanything.''\n\n   A local law enforcement source called it ``pretty scary'' that\nthe suspect and bomb materials surfaced by chance.\n\n   Federal investigators are looking for links to any known\nassociates in Seattle or groups the suspect might be connected to,\nthe source said.\n\n   Ressam had reservations at the Best Western Loyal Inn near\nSeattle Center for Tuesday night. On New Year's Eve, thousands of\npeople are expected at a celebration at the nearby Space Needle.\n\n   Local law enforcement sources said Friday that federal agents\nhave warned them that such large structures and public gathering\nplaces could be targets for terrorism.\n\n   After learning of Ressam's arrest, Seattle Center officials\nstepped up security Friday, and announced they would put gated\nfences around the campus for the millennium celebration.\n\n   ``We want people to feel safe,'' Allen said.\n\n   Ressam apparently had no plans to be in Seattle for the New\nYear.\n\n   He made the reservations Tuesday for only one night, the motel\nmanager said. He had plane tickets under another name to fly\nWednesday from Seattle to New York, then London, according to court\ndocuments.\n\n   Agents said Ressam also had maps and travel guides in his car\nfor Washington, Oregon and California.\n\n   Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of counterterrorism at the\nCIA, said the purpose of bringing the explosives into the United\nState was clear.\n\n   ``This was an operation to blow something up. It's hard to see\nwhat else it could be,'' said Cannistraro, now a security\nconsultant in McLean, Va.\n\n   Court documents said Ressam was wanted in Canada under an\nimmigration warrant and for theft under $5,000.\n\n   CBS, NBC and CNN reported Friday night that Ressam may have ties\nto Osama bin Laden, accused of heading and funding a terrorist\ncampaign against the United States.\n\n   But no one could link Ressam directly to any terrorist\norganization.\n\n   Montreal, where an apartment was rented under one of the names\nRessam used, has a large Algerian population.
