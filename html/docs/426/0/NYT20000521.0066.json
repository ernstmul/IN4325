William J. Hughes, a New Jersey\nDemocrat.  \n\n   Justice Department officials say they never have encouraged\npolice to avoid their own laws.  \n\n   ``A real motivation on the federal side is to reward the help we\nget from our brother and sister law enforcement,'' said Jerry\nMcDowell, head of the Justice Department's money laundering and\nasset forfeiture division.  \n\n   ``The real motivation here is to knock the socks off the\ncriminal gangs.''  \n\n   But the hand-offs are possible only because the Justice\nDepartment twisted the 1984 law, which simply allowed federal\nagencies to share forfeitures with local police who helped in a\njoint investigation.  \n\n   In addition to addressing joint investigations, the Justice\nDepartment wrote guidelines that established an ``adoption''\nprocedure, allowing federal agencies to adopt forfeitures from\nlocal cases when they weren't even involved.  \n\n   Even as they were writing the guidelines, Justice Department\nofficials had in hand a study showing that adoptions would conflict\nwith state laws, most of which made some effort to keep seized\nmoney from going directly back to police.  \n\n   The study showed more than half the states specifically\ndesignated the money to go somewhere else, such as to a state\nfund.  \n\n   But Justice attorneys determined that state laws did not\nspecifically prohibit police from turning over a seizure to a\nfederal agency.  \n\n   State and local law enforcement quickly began taking their\nseizures to the federal government, said David Smith, who worked\nwith forfeitures in the Justice Department in the early 1980s.  \n\n   ``I don't think anybody ever anticipated that it would be as\nwildly successful as it was in getting the police motivated to do\nmore forfeitures,'' said David Smith, who left the department in\n1986 and now co-chairs a committee on forfeiture abuse for the\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  \n\n     brk:Not a hard sell   \n   tx:The quick launch of the adoption program came thanks to\ntraining seminars that the Justice Department put on to show police\nhow to take advantage of it.  \n\n   Brad Cates, then-director of the department's Office of Asset\nForfeiture, pointed out in 1988 that training was going especially\nwell in California.  \n\n   ``Something like 500 police chiefs and whatnot have attended,''\nCates told a House judiciary subcommittee hearing that year.  \n\n   Beyond training, federal officials sometimes have recruited\npolice.  \n\n   In 1990, just a few days after the Missouri Supreme Court ruled\nthat state forfeitures had to go to education in most cases, the\nU.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri wrote a letter\nto state and local law enforcement agencies.  \n\n   ``I know that all of you in law enforcement are in desperate\nneed for additional financial resources,'' wrote Jean Paul\nBradshaw. He explained that police could bring seizures to a\nfederal agency even if the agency had no involvement in the case.  \n\n   ``As most of you know, the money we share through our forfeiture\nprogram goes directly to the state or local law enforcement\nagency,'' he wrote.  \n\n   Not that the federal program has ever been a hard sell to\npolice.  \n\n   For example, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol was\nreluctant to expand its role and step up seizures from traffic\nstops _ until a DEA agent presented the federal forfeiture program\nduring a meeting.  \n\n   ``Then everybody's eyes lit up,'' the head of North Carolina's\nDepartment of Crime Control and Public Safety told congressmen in\n1989.  \n\n   In two years, the Justice Department returned more than $117\nmillion in adoptive and joint forfeiture proceeds to state and\nlocal departments across the country.  \n\n   But police were circumventing state laws to take part in the\nfederal program. For example, in California, where federal agencies\nwere focusing their program, state law at that time required\nforfeited money to go to a mental health fund. But police\nthemselves got $48 million in just one year.  \n\n   ``We receive a case which is in every aspect a local case, been\nworked on pretty much by the local agencies all the way from\nbeginning to end, and we put our cover on it,'' Joe Whitley, deputy\nassistant attorney general, told the House judiciary subcommittee.  \n\n   Then-U.S. Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, a Florida Democrat, was\nshocked.  \n\n   ``What you are telling me basically is that the federal\ngovernment is complicit with the law enforcement agencies in\nCalifornia in trying to, in essence, subvert the California state\nlaw,'' Smith said.  \n\n   Such revelations led Hughes in 1988 to sponsor an amendment to\nprohibit federal agencies from overriding state forfeiture laws.\nCongress passed the amendment, which was to take effect Oct. 1,\n1989.  \n\n   But Justice and law enforcement lobbied against it. And\nunbeknownst to many members of Congress, a repeal of the amendment\nhad been slipped into a large defense appropriations bill.  \n\n   ``We did not know about that (provision) until after it was\napproved,'' Hughes says today. ``We were all surprised.''  \n\n   Even now, Hughes and others say they don't know who was\nresponsible for the measure.  \n\n   To Hughes, the issue was dead. He said he wrote then-U.S.\nAttorney General Richard Thornburgh to request a meeting about the\nforfeitures but never got a response.  \n\n   ``I made a very serious effort to try to stem what looked like\nwould become a pretty regular practice of circumventing state\nlaw,'' Hughes said. ``The power of law enforcement was too much.''  \n\n   Thornburgh, who is now a Washington lawyer, for the past six\nmonths did not return a reporter's telephone calls requesting an\ninterview.  \n\n   But Edwin Meese III, who was U.S. attorney general during the\nearly years of the federal program, said he is worried about the\ndirection of adoptions.  \n\n   ``This is a serious problem,'' said Meese, who is now with the\nHeritage Foundation.  \n\n   ``It is important for law enforcement leaders not to allow the\nmoney to be the tail wagging the dog.''  \n\n   Even Bradshaw, the former U.S. attorney in Kansas City, now\nquestions the adoption program.  \n\n   ``It seems to me it is getting far afield from what it was\nintended, from what perhaps the federal role ought to be,''\nBradshaw said.\n","Headline":"\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT A HINDRANCE, NOT A HELP, ON FORFEITURE LAWS \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The U.S. Department of Justice is far more\nthan a silent partner in the mass evasion of state laws by local\npolice and state patrols.  \n","\n   In fact, the Justice Department is the main culprit, The Kansas\nCity Star has found.  \n","\n   The Justice Department invented the system that allows police to\nkeep most of the drug money they seize contrary to most state laws.\nIt then trained police how to use the system and fought efforts to\nreform it, The Star found.  \n","\n   The chief sponsor of the 1984 law that created a partnership\nbetween federal agencies and police now wishes he had never opened\nthe door.  \n","\n   ``It was never envisioned that the feds would circumvent state\nlaw,'' says former U.S. Rep.
