Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Shopping online or visiting a Web site that requires\nregistration usually means surrendering some privacy _ providing a\nname, e-mail address and other personal information.\n\n   Some Internet users bristle at the notion that Web sites gather\nsuch data, no matter how safely tucked away the companies say the\ninformation is. On the other hand, some people are not bothered at\nall.\n\n   Just how concerned Web users should be about privacy, and how\nmuch of it they should have to give up when they go online, is a\nheated topic among Web companies, consumer advocates, and users\nthemselves.\n\n   In response to the growing discomfort about how personal\ninformation might be used without a person's knowledge, several\ncompanies, including Enonymous, PrivaSeek and Zero-Knowledge\nSystems, have developed ways for people to exert tighter control\nover who knows what about them. The companies, which call\nthemselves ``infomediaries,'' act as intermediaries, collecting\npersonal information from a user and providing it to other sites\nwith the user's approval.\n\n   ``Our research shows that consumers are concerned about privacy\nbut that very few people get involved and actively watch what's\nbeing done with their information,'' said Tim Kane, director of\nprivacy for Enonymous, San Diego. ``It's something they care about,\nbut they don't walk 10 feet for it.''\n\n   But some privacy advocates say these intermediaries are part of\nthe problem rather than a solution because they could profit from\nthe very information they are protecting.\n\n   ``The infomediaries are just more third parties who can change\ntheir mind while holding your information, or who could be bought\nby somebody else who has a different privacy policy,'' said Lauren\nWeinstein, co-founder of People for Internet Responsibility, an\norganization in Woodland Hills, Calif.\n\n   Indeed, among the first things that a user does at an\nintermediary's Web site is provide personal information. Surfers\ncan go to Enonymous.com, for example, and download a software\nprogram called Enonymous Adviser. When launched, the program asks\nthe user to provide information including name, date of birth,\nshipping and billing addresses, e-mail address, phone number,\ncredit card number and preferred method of contact.\n\n   Then, when the user goes shopping online or visits a portal or\nother site that requires registration, Enonymous checks to see what\nrating it has given the site's privacy policy _ whether and under\nwhat circumstances it will share information it receives with third\nparties, for example. The company has a team of site raters who\nhave given from one to four stars to more than 30,000 Web sites,\nKane said.\n\n   If the site has a low rating or has not been rated, the\nEnonymous Adviser sends a pop up message alerting the user. If, on\nthe other hand, the site has an adequate privacy policy, the\nsoftware retrieves the necessary data from the user's hard drive\nand fills in the blank fields when the user registers or makes a\npurchase.\n\n   Users can set up several different information packets. One can\ncontain only a name and e-mail address, for example, while another\ncan contain credit card information and a shipping address. The\nuser can then instruct the program to enter more or less\ninformation as desired.\n\n   Although the automatic form filler component is similar to other\n``digital wallets'' offered by companies including Gator.com and\nCyberCash.com, the ability to pick and choose the information\nreleased based on a site's privacy policy gives users more control,\nKane said.\n\n   So what does Enonymous get in exchange for all this\nconscientious watchdogging? Nothing, yet. Kane said the company\nisn't yet profitable, but that it expects to enter into\npartnerships with other Web sites so that it can offer e-commerce\nlinks, for example, at its site.\n\n   Enonymous is hoping to make money by persuading users of its\nsoftware to give up some of their privacy to it. The site currently\nbeckons users to visit the ``Enonymous Community'' and fill out a\nmarketing survey regarding their hobbies, their shopping\npreferences, and how they like to be contacted. Kane said Enonymous\nwill sell only this volunteered information. ``If we get a million\npeople who like this, we'll be able to charge merchants for the\ninformation we give them,'' he said. Delivering banner\nadvertisements and e-mail messages to people who answered the\nsurvey is also part of the company's plan. About half of the\n100,000 people who have downloaded the software have participated\nin the survey.\n\n   PrivaSeek, Broomfield, Colo., assumes that customers are willing\nto reveal some information about themselves as long as they get\nsomething in return. The company's PersonaValet program functions\nas a digital wallet, storing a user's information at a data center\n(not on the user's hard drive), and letting the user pick and\nchoose what data a site can have. Privaseek does not rate sites,\nassuming that users will read a site's privacy policy. Once a user\nsets up an account, PersonaValet maintains for the user a record of\nsites visited, on what date and what personal information was\nsubmitted.\n\n   The company has formed partnerships with several online\nmerchants, including ShopNow.com and RMI.net. In return for\nPrivaSeek's services, users will see advertisements and special\noffers geared to their interests and shopping tastes when they\nvisit partner sites, based on the information they have given to\nPrivaSeek. ``Web sites are making a lot of money off of selling\nthis information,'' said Steve Lucas, chief information officer at\nPrivaSeek. ``We believe consumers should profit from this exchange\ntoo,'' he added, by getting discounts and other offers that are not\navailable to people who don't provide personal information.\n\n   nn\n\n   The Freedom program from Zero-Knowledge Systems gives a Web\nsurfer anonymity by protecting identifiable information within the\nnetwork of the company's servers.\n\n   People who download the Freedom software can create several user\nidentities, or pseudonyms. In addition to encrypting data so that a\nperson or another computer cannot read it, Freedom routes the\ninformation through the company's network of servers so that it\ncannot be traced to a user's computer. The information is invisible\neven to Zero-Knowledge, said Austin Hill, president of the company.\n\n   ``We struggled a lot with how to build privacy into a protocol\nthat's never had privacy built in before,'' he said.\n\n   Each pseudonym costs $10 per year and the software can be\ndownloaded at www.freedom.net. Hill said that Zero-Knowledge also\nmarkets Freedom to companies that wish to protect their clients'\ninformation.\n\n   ``There is certainly a market of users who are willing to go out\nand pay for privacy,'' Hill said. ``But businesses are starting to\nrealize that privacy matters to their users.'' For example, he\nsaid, if health care companies wanting to put individual medical\ninformation online would have to be concerned with protecting\nprivacy.\n\n   Digitalme.com from Novell, which offers automatic form filling\nin exchange for a customer's agreement to accept e-mail\nadvertisements from its partners, and Anonymizer.com, a portal that\nsends users to its partner sites _ all of which have approved\nprivacy policies and which deliver banner advertisements based on\nsurveys the consumer has filled out _ are more variations on the\nintermediary theme.\n\n   But critics of the intermediaries say that the companies fail to\nprovide enough protection and that they have the potential to\nexploit what they are supposed to be protecting.\n\n   ``The infomediaries are a patchwork solution,'' said Chris\nKelly, an associate analyst at the Internet research firm Forrester\nResearch. ``They're taking the privacy issue far enough so that the\ngovernment doesn't come down hard, but even as far as they've come,\nthere are still privacy breaches.''\n\n   Weinstein of People for Internet Responsibility said that\ninstead of using intermediaries, Web surfers should stop providing\nsites with information if they don't necessarily have to.\n\n   ``People should start saying no to these information requests,''\nhe said. ``Because in the end we're finding that very often the\ninformation is being abused, sold, manipulated, or just plain\ncorrupted. It's just not worth it.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Apart from the intermediaries, efforts to develop industry-wide,\nenforceable privacy standards have been proceeding slowly. For the\npast few years, the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization,\nbased in Washington, that sets standards for the Internet, has been\nworking on the Platform for Privacy Preferences initiative, known\nas P3P. The initiative includes plans for a software program that\nwould let Web browsers automatically read a Web site's privacy\npolicy and compare it with the user's privacy preferences.\n\n   But it is unclear how P3P will work with existing intermediary\nprograms, and whether browser companies and Web developers will\nincorporate it into their products.\n\n   Other critics of P3P say it does nothing to improve existing\nprivacy policies, or breaches of them. ``These companies have no\ncompelling reason not to pass on personal information to someone\nwho will pay for it, and P3P doesn't say that it shouldn't go on,\nit only says you should know about it,'' said Andrew Shen, policy\nanalyst at Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.\n``What we really need are higher privacy standards and\nenforcement.''\n\n   After a recent privacy conference, Richard Purcell, director of\ncorporate privacy for the Microsoft Corp., said the company was\nworking toward developing a P3P compliant program for businesses\nand people before the end of the year. ``It will automatically\ncompare a Web site operator's privacy practices to the consumer's\npreferences, and inform the consumer of any nonconformance or\nmismatch,'' he said.\n\n   Laurie Cranor, chairwoman of the P3P specification working\ngroup, said Web developers would see a working version of P3P this\nsummer. ``There are some who've been critical of the whole idea,\nbut it's not meant to solve all privacy problems,'' Cranor said.\n``It's aimed specifically at providing consumers with notice about\na site's policy.''    \n  \n","Headline":"\nINTERMEDIARIES STEP INTO PRIVACY VOID\n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Shopping online or visiting a Web site that requires\nregistration usually means surrendering some privacy _ providing a\nname, e-mail address and other personal information.\n","\n   Some Internet users bristle at the notion that Web sites gather\nsuch data, no matter how safely tucked away the companies say the\ninformation is.
