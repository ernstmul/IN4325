But those that are trained to fight are starved and abused\nand trained to kill.''\n\n   Pit Bulls _ formally called Staffordshire terriers _ have been a\nfavorite of gang members since the early 1990s as a symbol of fear\nand virility. Their stout stances, boxy heads and massive jaw\nmuscles _ traits supposedly bred into the dogs specifically for\nring fighting _ make them potentially among the most dangerous\nbreeds when trained to fight.\n\n   Outbreaks of pit bull attacks have been widely publicized, and\ncities around the country have considered banning or imposing\nstrict regulations on pit bulls. Public fear has even spread to\nFrance, where recent attacks in a Paris suburb sparked an angry\nuprising from people who denounced the breed as not only dangerous\nbut an American fad.\n\n   In Boston last month an attack by two pit bulls sent three\nsisters to the hospital, including a pregnant woman who gave birth\nprematurely after the attack. Then, a man stabbed a pit bull to\ndeath as he was being attacked, and a Boston police officer shot\nand killed a pit bull near a park after the dog attacked a woman.\n\n   Police and animal control officials are investigating whether\nthe dogs in the first incident may have had links to gangs.\n\n   Specialists who work with pit bulls say that despite their\nreputation, the dogs are no more likely to attack than other\nbreeds, unless they are abused.\n\n   ``When they're raised normally, they're very sweet,'' said Karyn\nPrestier, an animal caregiver at the MSPCA in Boston.\n\n   The animal shelter has seen increasing evidence of dogs trained\nfor fighting, however. ``It's there,'' she said. ``It's\nunderground, but we know it's going on.''\n\n   Boston already has an ordinace requiring dogs with violent\nhistories to be kept indoor or in pens. But the council's proposed\nordinance would specifically target pit bulls. At the very least,\ncouncilors say fines for owners who don't control their dogs should\nbe raised from $50 for a first offense to $250.\n","Headline":"\nMANGLED PIT BULL MAY HAVE SETTLED GANGS' SCORE \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Animal control officials were horrified last year when\nthey discovered the story behind the naked carcass of a young dog.\n","\n   Rival gangs, embroiled in a turf war, had settled the dispute by\nputting their prized mascot pit bulls in a ring to fight, officials\ndiscovered after interviewing gang members.
