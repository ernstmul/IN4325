They need company. Well-socialized pets\n_ dogs that respect and interact comfortably with people as well as\nother dogs _ are happy and responsive.\n\n   But because today's families tend to spend less and less time at\nhome, their gregarious canine companions sometimes miss out on the\nsocializing they crave. More often than not, a chewed-on slipper or\na mess on the floor signals a lack of social stimuli.\n\n   Boredom-busting strategies that may soothe the sensitive or\nolder pet include leaving toys and treats out or scheduling midday\nwalks with a pet sitter.\n\n   Some dogs, however, simply can't play solitaire. In order to\ndevelop into friendly companions, young animals need extended\ninteractive playtime. Thus the ultimate in surrogate pet parenthood\n_ day-care facilities for dogs _ is quickly becoming a solution.\n\n   Dog day care got its start in 1987, when Joe Sporn, then a pre-\nvet student and dog groomer in New York City, founded what would\nbecome the Yuppie Puppy in his basement by helping out his\nneighbors with their pets.\n\n   Sporn's example quietly gathered force for a few years until the\nSan Francisco SPCA opened its Doggy Daycare Center in 1994. It\nbegan as a projected five-year pilot program and has since become a\nworldwide model.\n\n   The concept behind dog day care is simple: Dogs meet, greet and\nplay the day away. Animal behaviorist and trainer John Bohnenkamp,\nof Perfect Paws in San Francisco, believes that day care for dogs\nprovides a beneficial environment when ``the dogs are closely\nsupervised. Dogs need someone to create activities,'' Bohnenkamp\nsays, ``and manage any potential problems that may arise, like\npossessiveness over toys.''\n\n   Rebecca Bisgyer, owner of Dog-ma Daycare for Dogs, in\nWashington, D.C., begins each day with a group activity intended to\nestablish her position as the pack leader. Although dogs at\nBisgyer's facility are screened for temperament before being\naccepted, this routine morning exercise helps to keep dominance\nconflicts among the pets to a minimum.\n\n   Afterward, dogs break off into impromptu smaller groups for\ncontinued play. Troublemakers receive ``time-outs'' in specially\ndesignated areas. And all dogs at Dog-ma can have their own\ndowntime in specified napping areas.\n\n   With 30-minute pet-sitter visits running in the $12-$20 range\naround the country, the $15-$25 price tag for a full day of dog day\ncare would make it seem like a virtual bargain.\n\n   But, when tallied at $5,000 a year, the amount tops my\nchildren's annual parochial-school tuition, even considering the\nfact that the dogs spend more hours in day care than the kids do at\nschool. Many centers do, however, accept dogs part time (the hourly\nfee may be higher), and some also offer boarding.\n\n   Most dog day-care centers require an interview with both you and\nyour dog. This is the time to examine the entire facility and get a\nfeel for the amount of attention your dog will receive.\n\n   Bisgyer gives the following tips: Rules, and all age and health\nrequirements, should be clearly posted. A mission statement is a\ngood sign; extreme cleanliness, plenty of water and an adequate\ndog-to-human ratio are even better. The space should not be overly\nnoisy _ that would be stressful to any dog. Try to find out how\nmuch the caretakers know about dog behavior and psychology, what\ntheir methods of discipline are, what they know about your breed\nand how they would interact with your dog on an individual level.\n\n   During the interview, check out the other dogs as well. Do they\nseem to be suitable playmates for your canine pal? Will your dog be\noverwhelmed? If so, how would the center ease your dog into the\nroutine? Should your pet not be accepted into a program because of\na behavior or attitude problem, by all means enroll in an obedience\nclass immediately.\n\n   Once dogs familiarize themselves with a program, Bisgyer\nexplains, it's easy to tell whether they are enjoying it. For\nexample, your dog should look forward to getting into the car in\nthe morning to go to ``school.''\n\n   Jon Kelliher, manager of the San Francisco SPCA's Doggy Daycare\nCenter, reports that when one of his client's dog sees the dog\nlunch bag come out of the breakfast cabinet at home on Friday\nmornings (for her once-a-week attendance), ``the dog goes\nabsolutely nuts with excitement.'' At night, dogs should be\nthoroughly and blissfully exhausted.\n\n   Some pet owners may consider the notion of dog day care\nextravagant; others will view it as part of responsible pet\nownership. But wherever or however you socialize your dog _ long\nafternoon walks, Frisbee chasing in the park or action-packed dog\nday care _ it can only benefit both you and your pet. No matter how\nthe days play out, there are always the evenings to spend together.\n\n   SIDEBAR\n\n   TO LEARN MORE\n\n   There is currently no national organization for dog day-care\ncenters, but you can access specific sites on the Web.
