What we learn about our pets from experts,\nfriends, and, especially, our own observations _ sometimes\nsurprises us but ultimately helps us take better care of them. With\nlong-running contact, however, we sometimes come to take our pets\nfor granted. That's when we may miss a clue to understanding pet\nbehavior. Here are some situations that deserve a closer look.\n\n   To communicate with our pets we need to listen as well as talk\nto them. Does a dog howl, for instance, from loneliness? A dog that\nis isolated from its family, either canine or human, may indeed cry\nout for company, just as wolves locate one another in the wild.\n\n   With their heightened pack identity, beagles especially are\nprone to plaintive howling when left alone. But some breeds, like\nmy schipperke, Momo, who is rarely left all alone, just can't\nresist replying to other dogs' howling. It is another throwback to\ntheir wolf heritage: The pack sings as one recreationally early in\nthe morning and in the evening to initiate the hunt. In Momo's\ncase, the daily one o'clock firehouse siren inspires him to warble\nalong and other neighborhood dogs often join in the vocalizing.\n\n   One of the first signs of illness for any animal is loss of\nappetite. But is your cat sick or just a finicky eater? If it turns\nfood away, make sure first that there isn't a health problem by\nasking your vet. After that, look on food preference as a\npotentially serious problem in itself.\n\n   According to ``CatWatch,'' the newsletter of the Cornell\nUniversity Feline Health Center in Ithaca, N.Y., some cats would\nrather starve than eat food they don't like, and preferences can be\nset as early as six months. Kittens raised on a varied diet develop\ndemocratic palates.\n\n   Housebreaking dogs calls for the use of a crate, but is it\nreally true that dogs never soil their crate? Most animals try to\nkeep their sleeping area clean, but that doesn't mean you can count\non it. Puppies have to learn control, and they can't be expected to\nwait for unreasonably long periods. A puppy should be taken outside\nimmediately after eating and drinking, and no adult dog should have\nto wait longer than 20 minutes.\n\n   No dog _ adult or puppy _ should be held in a crate for more\nthan four hours at a stretch. The crate should be large enough for\nthe dog to stand, turn around and lie down comfortably, but not so\nlarge that there will be room set aside for eliminating.\n\n   And when the dog is in the yard, how best to fence it in?\n``Invisible,'' that is, electric- or sonar-producing fences, keep\nthe landscape clear and may cost less than traditional fencing.\nPain, however, is the tool. Even if, as some argue, the pain may be\nmild, you must decide if you desire these conditions for your pet's\noverall well-being.\n\n   In addition, the fences are rendered ineffectual when dogs dash\nthrough them in hot pursuit of a squirrel or another dog, then\nwon't come back for fear of the shock that awaits them. If you\ndon't want to erect a wooden fence, try planting evergreens around\nyour property, then linking them with barely visible garden wire.\n\n   Taking your dog with you on outings is fun, but the dog should\nride inside the cab if you drive a pickup truck. Sudden braking,\nswerves or bumps in the road can send a dog flying out of the back\nof the truck and airborne debris can also cause injury.\n\n   ``If absolutely necessary,'' recommends Michael Kaufmann, the\nAmerican Humane Association's director of educational programs, in\nEnglewood, Colo., ``a dog can be put in a crate that is securely\nfastened to the truck bed.'' Some states have laws against dogs\nriding in the backs of trucks.\n\n   For cats, outdoor adventures often include vigorous tree\nclimbing. Cats love to sink their claws into rough bark and shoot\nstraight up the trunk. Sometimes, though, they glue themselves to a\nbranch and refuse to come down. The reason is not that they're\nafraid of the height, but that their anatomy is better suited to\nascent than descent.\n\n   John Hermanson, associate professor of biomedical sciences at\nCornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, in Ithaca,\nN.Y., explains, ``Squirrels and some other arboreal mammals have\nspecialized capabilities that allow them to rotate their ankles\nnearly 180 degrees while climbing head-first down the trunk of a\ntree.'' Since cats don't have this ability, you may have to haul\nout the ladder to help them down. You can try benign neglect first:\nCats often creep down by themselves without the stress of people\nsurrounding them.\n\n   One situation fraught with tension is a dogfight. Even though\nyour dog may be on a leash, someone else's may not be. Or two dogs\nmight be playing seemingly peacefully in the park when_ without\nwarning _ a fight breaks out.\n\n   ``Our first instinct _ to try to break up the fight by yelling\nor grabbing our dogs _ is not the correct solution,'' warns Michael\nKaufmann of the AHA. In the intensity of the moment, your own dog\ncould inadvertently bite you; yelling only heightens the emotional\nturmoil. Instead, drop your leash and pause.\n\n   Most dogfights, however terrifying, last only seconds. But if a\nsmall dog is being victimized or if the fight doesn't end promptly,\ntry spraying the dogs with a hose, swinging a big stick or throwing\nclothing into the fray to intervene.\n\n   Of all the inner workings of our pets, the one we may least\nunderstand is the powerful, seemingly interpsychic connection\nbetween them and us. Rupert Sheldrake examines the ways animals\ntune in to our behavior in his book ``Dogs That Know When Their\nOwners Are Coming Home'' (Crown; 1999; $25).\n\n   According to Sheldrake, the bonds between our companion animals\nand ourselves may be so strong that they create a ``morphic\nfield,'' a physical connection that enables them to locate us\nacross distances and to anticipate our actions even before we\nconsciously know them ourselves. The deeper our bonds, it seems,\nthe more we learn about the nature of life itself.\n\n   (Toni Gardner is a contributing editor of ``Country Living''\nmagazine.)\n\n   ---------------------------------------\n\n     EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Web site at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on LIFEBEAT\nand other features.  \n\n     NONSUBSCRIBERS: To publish a ``separate-buy'' feature article, it\nmust be purchased.
