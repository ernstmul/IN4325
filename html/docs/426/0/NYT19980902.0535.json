He used code names to identify meeting places; drugs and\nthe quantity being sought were never mentioned on the telephone.\n\n   ``The ones who survive are very cagey,'' Eddie said.  \n\n   Eddie, investigators say, typifies area heroin dealers. They\ndeal in small quantities of the lucrative drug. They sell to young\nusers who protect their own kind. And the major dealers don't deal\nwith strangers.\n\n   That creates impossible odds for investigators, who must rely on\ninformants and undercover agents to infiltrate drug dealers'\ncircles.\n\n   ``We're only as good as our informants,'' said Grapevine police\nSgt. Sam Gladney, who is assigned to the Northeast Tarrant County\nDrug Task Force.\n\n   The barriers to getting that information on the deadly dealers\nof heroin are many:\n\n   The legion of today's heroin users are young, making it\ndifficult for undercover agents to blend in.\n\n   Heroin use is growing in suburban areas, where its use is more\nclandestine than in urban areas, and suburban users more likely can\nafford quick, savvy legal advice.\n\n   Parents and friends are not willing to turn in a teen-ager or to\ncall for an outside official's guidance.\n\n   Even when investigators make a bust, they often don't find\nenough heroin to press significant charges.\n\n   Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies only now are\nbeginning to work together on the same cases.\n\n   Heroin's spread beyond the inner city has changed the dynamics\nof law enforcement and resulted in many of the new barriers, police\nsay.\n\n   In suburban areas, users are much younger than the traditional\ninner-city addicts, impeding police in their efforts to infiltrate\nheroin circles and to go up the dope chain to find the dealers.\n\n   The young users ``just don't want to give up the friends,'' said\nBedford police Lt. Larry Romines, commander of the Northeast\nTarrant County Drug Task Force. ``That's the problem with this\ndrug. It's kind of like a cliquish thing.''\n\n   Most parents won't call Crime Stoppers, task forces or area\npolice departments to report that someone is a heroin user or a\ndealer, police said.\n\n   Occasionally, some parents ``past the denial stage will say,\n`Here's who he's talking to' and pass it on,'' Plano police officer\nRick Moore said. ``Occasionally, we'll talk to neighbors and\nthey'll give us license plate numbers of people they suspect.''\n\n   Heroin deals might be made on the streets of Fort Worth and\nDallas, but in Northeast Tarrant County they are cloistered behind\nclosed doors and are more difficult for police to track, officials\nsay.\n\n   Jason M., a 21-year-old recovering heroin addict from Haltom\nCity, said that when he was dealing, users came to his place or he\nwent to theirs. When he made deliveries, he put the heroin in\nbubble wrap and placed it inside a container of coffee beans to\nmask the odor. Even a drug-sniffing dog missed it once.\n\n   When suburban users are busted, they usually have a gram or less\nof heroin, which likely means a probated sentence, prosecutors say.\nA private attorney will usually be at their side quickly, said\nMargaret Beaudry, director of research with Drug Strategies in\nWashington, D.C.\n\n   ``And that lawyer is not going to let them turn over dealers,''\nBeaudry said. ``It's just a very different demographic. These are\nsharp, sharp attorneys that they're getting. These are the kids of\ndoctors and lawyers.''\n\n   Police say that they usually arrest young heroin users as soon\nas they catch them, rather than dragging out the investigations and\nrisking overdoses.\n\n   ``They buy what they're going to use,'' Gladney said. ``As soon\nas they buy it, they want to get it in their arms or up their nose.\nThey can't wait until they drive back over here.''\n\n   To overcome the secrecy protecting heroin use, police are\nsearching for new tactics and alliances.\n\n   In Denton, drug agents work with informants who know dealers of\nother drugs, said Denton County Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard\nMankoff, commander of the North Central Texas Narcotics Task Force,\nwhich serves Denton, Grayson and Wise counties.\n\n   ``Those sources, they've heard about it and they lead us to\nothers,'' he said.\n\n   Some fear that pressuring young people to inform may backfire\nand cause users not to seek medical help or treatment.\n\n   George Malina's 20-year-old son, Milan, died of a heroin\noverdose in June 1997. Friends who were with Milan when he\noverdosed kept an eye on him but were too afraid to call an\nambulance because they also had been doing the drug, Malina said.\nBy the time the friends took Milan to the hospital, it was too\nlate.\n\n   A no-questions-asked policy for anyone who takes an overdose\nvictim to a hospital could keep more young people from dying,\nMalina said.\n\n   Collaboration by law enforcement agencies is vital, Beaudry\nsaid. Although authorities at all levels have communicated with one\nanother for years, they focused on avoiding duplication of efforts\nso that no two agencies were working the same case.\n\n   Only recently have suburban, city, state and federal law\nenforcement agencies come together on cases.\n\n   One such endeavor is the Northeast Tarrant County Drug Task\nForce, part of a countywide narcotics intelligence group.
