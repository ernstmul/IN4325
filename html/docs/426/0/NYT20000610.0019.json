But\nlawmakers and some legal experts sa the circumvention threatens\ncivil liberties by bypassing state laws, which generally provide\nmore protection to property owners than federal law.\n\n   Unlike many legislators elsewhere, those in Missouri already\nknew about the federal handoffs and passed a reform bill in the\nstate Senate this year. But the bill died on the last day of the\nsession.\n\n   Now Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat who co-sponsored\nthe bill, pledges to make it his primary goal to get the bill\npassed by February. The session begins in January.\n\n   The other sponsor, Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker\npro tem, said he will be pushing from his side of the General\nAssembly.\n\n   ``It's high on my radar screen,'' Kreider said. ``This is the\nright thing to do.''\n\n   Missouri law prohibits police from handing seized property over\nto a federal law enforcement agency. Instead police are required to\nnotify a prosecutor.

Craig Hosmer, a Springfield Democrat, who thinks\npolice departments need seizure money to fight the war on drugs.\n\n   ``There is nothing in my read of our constitution that what they\nare doing is illegal,'' Hosmer said. ``They are using another\navenue that is available to make sure they have resources to do the\njob that they believe is very important.''\n\n   Kreider disagreed.\n\n   ``Rep. Hosmer believes the bill will hurt law enforcement,''\nKreider said. ``I sincerely believe that it will hurt law\nenforcement worse the way it is now. It will hurt their reputation.\nIt will hurt them in the long run by circumventing the law and\npossibly violating the rights of Americans.''\n\n   Gov.
