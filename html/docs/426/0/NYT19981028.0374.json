This is a pretty good\ncountdown. It's right up there with the best of them,'' NASA test\ndirector Steve Altemus said.\n\n   Hurricane Mitch no longer posed a threat to the launch, weather\nexperts said.\n\n   ``We're looking at a zero percent chance of weather prohibiting\nlaunch,'' said Capt. Clif Stargardt, a meteorologist with the Air\nForce's 45th weather squadron, which supports space shuttle\nlaunches.\n\n   Stargardt said this is a refreshing difference from Glenn's 1962\nMercury flight, when weather caused four of the 10 delays in his\nlaunch. He finally lifted off on Feb. 20 for a four hour, 55-minute\nflight that made him the first American to orbit the earth.\n\n   ``It looks like Mother Nature wants to see John Glenn return to\nspace just as much as the rest of us,'' he said.\n\n   If all continues to go well, space shuttle Discovery will blast\noff at 2 p.m. today with nearly 7 million pounds of thrust, sending\nthe 77-year-old Glenn on an eight day, 22-hour orbital mission that\nhas drawn worldwide attention. The shuttle is scheduled to land\nback here at 11:50 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 7.\n\n   At Pad 34-B, the massive Rotating Service Structure was swung\naway from the shuttle at sunset, revealing the white, winged\norbiter Discovery for the first time since it was put on the launch\npad for this mission.\n\n   Its seven crew members gathered later in the evening at the foot\nof the towering, 184-foot-tall rocket to see their families for the\nlast time before launch. There were no hugs and kisses. Restricted\nby their traditional pre-launch quarantine, astronauts and family\nmembers could only stand apart from each other and wave, Altemus\nsaid.\n\n   Fueling of the shuttle's rust-colored external tank was to begin\nat 5:40 a.m. today. Once the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen\npropellants are loaded, the entire shuttle will weigh in at about\n4.5 million pounds.\n\n   In contrast, Glenn's Mercury-Atlas vehicle weighed just under\n260,000 pounds at the start of his first space flight.\n\n   The launch team's biggest challenge appeared to be guessing what\nPresident Clinton will do. Clinton plans to watch the launch, but\nAltemus said his specific plans were ``constantly changing.''\n\n   If Clinton decides to call the crew, the launch team will have\nto figure out how to fit it into the countdown without upsetting\nthe tightly scheduled sequence of events, launch managers said.\n\n   Besides Clinton, about 200 politicians are expected to be in a\nVIP viewing crowd.
