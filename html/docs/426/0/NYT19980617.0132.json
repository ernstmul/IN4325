The county would only\nenforce the rules if neighbors rat out a roaming cat to animal\ncontrol officers. First-time offenders can escape the fine if they\nsterilize their cat within 15 days.\n\n   Commissioners also modified the qualifications for a hobby\nbreeder.\n\n   The changes, which will go into effect in about three months,\nare part of an overhaul of the county's animal care and control\nrules, which haven't been changed significantly in nine years.\nOfficials hope the new rules will cut down on pet overpopulation.\n\n   ``Our approach to feral cats has basically been to trap them and\nkill them,'' Animal Care and Control Director Dennis Moore said.\nThat hasn't worked well, he said.\n\n   Bradley, who founded the nonprofit Palm Beach Cat Rescue 12\nyears ago, feeds wild cats on the island and says the new rules are\nmodeled after her program.\n\n   ``I know each face of my 300 animals,'' she said. The rules\nrequire Bradley and other caregivers to sterilize and vaccinate\ncats, promote adoption of kittens, tag their ears, plant micro-chip\nidentifiers in their bodies, and, if necessary, euthanize sick\ncats. Bradley said donations to her charity will cover the cost.\n\n   The rules aim to reduce ``puppy mills'' by tightening the\ndefinition of hobby breeders _ those who breed cats and dogs on a\nsmaller and higher-quality scale than commercial breeders.\n\n   Some breeders, many from the Jupiter-Tequesta Dog Club, balked\nat the requirement that they take back dogs that have been abused,\nbecause that requirement might put them over the legal limit of\nkeeping 10 dogs on their property. They would always take back a\ndog that didn't work out, they said, because they are responsible.\n\n   County Commission Chairman Burt Aaronson didn't approve of a\n``lemon law'' for dogs and voted against the entire ordinance,\nwhich passed 4-1, with Commissioners Ken Foster and Mary McCarty\nabsent.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH _ Catherine Bradley, the ``cat lady'' of Palm\nBeach, can feed wild cats now without pussy-footing around the law.\n","\n   The Palm Beach County Commission on Tuesday (June 16) approved a\nnew rule allowing people to care for wild cat colonies as long as\nthey register with the Animal Care and Control Division and follow\ncertain requirements.\n","\n   ``God in his mercy has given me my day here,'' Bradley said.\n","\n   The new rules also require owners to keep non-sterilized tabbies\nindoors or face a yet-to-be-determined fine.
