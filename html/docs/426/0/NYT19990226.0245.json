Abecnego Monje Ortiz heard four shots.\n\n   Then a bullet hit him in the back, between the shoulder blades,\nfired by a law enforcement officer participating in an anti-drug\ntask force. The others who had crossed the Rio Grande with Monje\nhad fled, leaving him alone in the dark.\n\n   ``I felt a sting on my back and I fell. I thought I was dying,''\nMonje, 18, said from his bed at the Brooke Army Medical Center in\nSan Antonio, where he has been since the Jan. 25 shooting.\n\n   Paralyzed from the waist down, Monje probably never will walk\nagain.\n\n   He had crossed the Rio Grande in an inner tube, landing in the\nUnited States at a remote area near Eagle Pass, Texas. There were\nat least 14 others with him _ part of the nightly stream of\nthousands of illegal immigrants who head north from Mexico in\nsearch of work.\n\n   The shooting underscores the volatility of the border at a time\nwhen various agencies are attempting to stop both illegal\nimmigrants and drugs from entering the United States.\n\n   ``The United States has every right to protect its borders, if\nand when there is respect for human rights, and these immigrants\nare accorded the dignity of human beings,'' said Jose Luis Suarez y\nCoello, the Mexican consul-general in Eagle Pass.\n\n   The Eagle Pass shooting comes less than two years after\n18-year-old Esequiel Hernandez was shot dead near Redford, a West\nTexas border town. He was killed by a U.S. Marine who was part of\nan anti-drug force under the supervision of the Border Patrol. The\nMarine was cleared of wrongdoing, although the federal government\npaid a settlement to the victim's family.\n\n   Earlier in 1997, an illegal immigrant named Cesareo Vasquez\nAcuna was shot and wounded by an Army Green Beret anti-drug patrol\noutside Brownsville, Texas. Vasquez was carrying a pistol and later\npleaded guilty to assault on a federal officer.\n\n   Wilbur Honeycutt, a law enforcement officer assigned full-time\nto a multi-agency drug task force, shot Monje, according to the\nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The FBI is investigating the\nshooting.\n\n   Monje's family has filed a $25 million claim against the DEA to\nseek rehabilitation for the young man.\n\n   ``We've asked for that amount because we cannot go back later\nand add to it in the event he needs more medical care than we\nanticipated,'' said Shawn Lyons, Monje's lawyer. ``It's impossible\nto put a price on this kind of thing.''\n\n   Honeycutt was not available for comment. He has not been charged\nor accused of any wrongdoing.\n\n   ``Mr. Honeycutt is still assigned full-time to the DEA task\nforce,'' said Maverick County District Attorney Robert Serna, who\nassigned Honeycutt to the team in June. ``It's a situation where an\ninvestigation is ongoing and we'll see where the facts lead us. We\nare trying to do what's right.''\n\n   The area around Eagle Pass has been designated a high-intensity\ndrug trafficking area (HIDTA) under a program funded by the White\nHouse Office of the National Drug Control Policy.\n\n   Officials defend the anti-drug program and the concentration of\nlaw enforcement officers along the border.\n\n   ``It is one of the most successful programs because it gives\nlocal, state and federal police the chance to work together on an\nequal basis,'' said Vernon Parker, an HIDTA official in San\nAntonio.\n\n   Monje has not been charged and his lawyer said the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service isn't seeking to deport him.\n\n   Lyons wants to find a rehabilitation hospital for his client\nbecause he won't be able to stay at the military hospital\nindefinitely.\n\n   With his mother and a sister at his bedside, Monje said he\nwished he never had left his small farm in the west-central state\nof Michoacan.\n\n   ``I am very sorry I came,'' Monje said, almost whispering.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   The Mexican government has been voicing concern that the U.S.\ntightening of its southern border has resulted in the deaths of\nMexican citizens because they must travel longer, more perilous\nroutes to avoid interception.\n\n   Monje said he plays the events of that fateful night on Jan. 25\nover and over in his mind.
