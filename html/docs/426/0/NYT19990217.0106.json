You are being watched.\n\n   Everytime you log onto the Internet, you're probably helping to\nbuild a dossier on yourself.\n\n   The most sophisticated shopping sites on the Web keep track of\neverything you buy, and analyze the information in an effort to\nsell you still more goodies.\n\n   Other sites entice you with come-ons like free electronic mail\naccounts, in exchange for personal information like your name and\ntelephone number. Still other sites don't ask you for anything, but\nsimply keep track of your electronic wanderings, using the in\n\n   formation to create a personal profile that is a marketer's\ndream.\n\n   Scary? Some people think so.\n\n   A survey last year by Business Week magazine found that more\nthan three-quarters of those who shop on the Internet say they\nwould buy even more if there were better privacy safeguards. And\namong those who didn't shop on line, privacy fears were the chief\nreason they stay away.\n\n   The popular computer network America Online created a national\nfuror last year when it released information about one of its\ncustomers to the US Navy. Timothy McVeigh had posted, anonymously,\ninformation on line that suggested he was gay. The Navy persuaded\nAOL to violate its own privacy policy and reveal McVeigh's\nidentity, whereupon he was discharged from the service.\n\n   McVeigh was subsequently reinstated after a federal court\nchallenge, but the incident served as a startling illustration of\nhow much personal information is available on line.\n\n   What kind of information can Web-based businesses collect and\nhow do they do it? The simplest method, and perhaps the most\nmisunderstood, is the ``cookie.'' A cookie is a small chunk of data\nthat is sent by a Web site to a visitor's computer. The cookie can\nbe used to store data that the visitor will need whenever he\nreturns to the site. For example, a visitor to the New York Times\nWeb site must get a password to sign in. But if he agrees, he can\nalso get a cookie that will ``remember'' his password. The next\ntime he visits the site, the Times computer will check his browser.\nIf the cookie is there, the visitor is instantly logged in, without\nhaving to retype the password.\n\n   Internet advertisers love cookies, because they make it possible\nto control exactly which ads are displayed on a person's computer.\nThis is the business of companies like New York-based DoubleClick,\nwhich attaches cookies to ads in order to create profiles of\nmillions of Internet users.\n\n   Here's how it works: Many commercial Web sites feature banner\nads linked to the DoubleClick network. When someone visits one of\nthese sites, his or her computer gets a cookie that notes the\nparticular ad being displayed. The cookie continues to track the\nuser, noting every visit to a site featuring DoubleClick ads. The\ncookie tracks which ads the user clicks on for more information,\nand which ads he or she ignores.\n\n   Little by little, DoubleClick builds up a profile of the Web\nsurfer, which can be used to send ads specifically tailored to his\nor her tastes. As a result, two different people visiting the same\nWeb page may see entirely different ads, depending on the content\nof their DoubleClick cookies.\n\n   To some, it might sound like Web users are being followed by\nsome virtual detective, but DoubleClick general manager Christopher\nSaridakis says that cookies are not an invasion of privacy. ``It\nreally doesn't contain any information about the individual,'' he\nsays.\n\n   DoubleClick doesn't know who you are or where you live. It just\nknows that somewhere out there, Person X, likes football,Continued\non next page Â  \nhates basketball and is interested in sport-utility vehicles.\nBesides, DoubleClick allows consumers who don't want to be tracked\nto opt out of the system. On request, they'll send out a cookie\nthat blocks all other DoubleClick cookies.\n\n   In general, cookies pose little threat to your privacy. A cookie\ncan only be read by the Web site that installed it. Even if you\nvisit a fly-by-night Web site run by hostile hackers, they can't\nlearn anything about you by accessing your cookies. Indeed, most\ncookies only contain a set of numbers that will be meaningless to\nany other computer but the one that created the cookie.\n\n   Still, for those who insist on avoiding them, most standard Web\nbrowsers can be set to warn the user of incoming cookies so that\nthe user can opt to refuse them. Unfortunately, so many sites\ninstall cookies that users will be bombarded with dozens of cookie\nrequests. To avoid this, some people use software tools with names\nlike InterMute and Internet Junkbuster that allow consumers to\nblock out nearly all cookies.\n\n   But there's a price to pay for life without cookies _ some Web\nsites won't let you in without one.\n\n   Nevertheless, Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a\nnewsletter based in Washington, D.C., refuses all cookies as a\nmatter of principle. ``I don't see any benefit to me in allowing\nthem to place a cookie,'' he says. ``The benefit's all to them.''\n\n   Hendricks acknowledges he's never heard of anyone suffering a\nloss of privacy because of cookies, but he fears that could change\nif companies find ways to link your cookie to a file of personal\ninformation about you.\n\n   It's already happening at hundreds of Web sites, where consumers\nprovide detailed personal information. Such information can be\ncombined with cookies to create a personalized customer profile _\nor to reveal sensitive information to complete strangers.\n\n   There are some advantages to personalization, however. An\nexample of it at its best can be found at eToys, a popular toy\nretailing site. Toy shoppers can create a personal account at the\nsite that will keep a permanent record of everything they have ever\npurchased there. The site also allows them to create a wish list of\ntoys they might want to buy in the future. It even has a calendar\nthat can send e-mail reminders of a child's birthday.\n\n   Other sites, like the popular bookseller Amazon.com, take\npersonalization even further. The Amazon site analyzes the books a\ncustomer buys, and directs the customer to other titles that might\nalso be of interest. ``Their business model is based on getting\nvery detailed information on their customers and what they do,''\nsays Hendricks.\n\n   And that's what scares him.\n\n   eToys vows never to sell the information it collects about its\ncustomers. Amazon reserves the right to do so, but will keep\ncustomer data private if the customer submits a request via e-mail.\nBut many other Web retailers make no such pledges. Under existing\nlaw, they're free to sell any information about you, to anyone\nwilling to buy it.\n\n   The same goes for the many Web sites that don't sell anything,\nbut still collect lots of personal data on visitors. Many sites\noffer free Web pages and free e-mail service. But these services\naren't really free. They're provided in exchange for personal\ninformation that can be used to build up a database of potential\ncustomers. And consumers have no control over what happens to this\ndata.\n\n   Perhaps the most aggressive effort yet to compile information on\ncomputer users was announced on Feb. 8. A California firm called\nFree-PC.com is giving away computer systems to the first 10,000\ncustomers who sign up for the company's free Internet access\nservice.\n\n   But there's a catch. Customers must provide lots of personal\ninformation _ name, address, age, marital status and so on. This\ninformation will be used to beam carefully targeted advertisements\nto each Free-PC.com user. In addition, the Free-PC.com system\ntracks every site the user visits, adding this data to the person's\nmarketing profile. Users who frequently visit personal-finance\nsites might see frequent ads for mutual funds or banks.\n\n   Free-PC officials say they'll sell their data collection to\nother companies, but will not include information that can be used\nto identify individuals, like names and addresses.\n\n   A survey taken last year by the Federal Trade Commission found\nthat only 14 percent of the 1,400 commercial Web sites surveyed\neven had an official privacy policy to inform consumers about how\ntheir personal data would be used. The Clinton administration has\nwarned Web-based businesses that unless they move aggressively to\nprovide better privacy guarantees, new federal laws are on the way.\n\n   Such laws may be inevitable because of events overseas. The 15\nnations of the European Union have imposed very strict privacy\nregulations on firms doing business inside its borders. For\ninstance, a European firm can't sell personal information about\ncustomers to a third party without getting explicit permission from\nthe customer. Now the EU is threatening to limit the ability of\nAmerican companies, including Internet companies, to do business in\nEurope unless the United States adopts equally tough privacy rules.\n\n   American companies are scrambling to stave off regulation by\nadopting voluntary privacy guarantees. TRUSTe, a nonprofit\norganization in Palo Alto, Calif., certifies companies that pledge\nto protect the privacy of Internet visitors. As of December 1997,\nonly 42 firms had signed up for TRUSTe certification. After\nwarnings from the federal government, the number jumped tenfold\nlast year, to 427 firms.\n\n   Susan Scott, TRUSTe's executive director, says that reputable\nWeb sites are becoming much less willing to share information about\ntheir customers. ``I think that the sites that are serious about\nthis have realized, hey, this is something we can't be cavalier\nabout,'' she says.\n\n   TRUSTe doesn't forbid members from sharing the information they\ncollect. Instead, the organization requires that certified\ncompanies clearly inform visitors about how the firm will use any\ninformation it collects. The idea is not to limit companies' use of\ndata, but to provide information so that consumers can make\ninformed decisions about whether to provide data.\n\n   It is unclear whether a voluntary program like TRUSTe will\nsatisfy the concerns of European regulators, who favor rigid legal\nprotections of consumer privacy. Besides, in the case of Timothy\nMcVeigh, AOL violated its own rules about releasing personal\ninformation. Some privacy advocates think that only federal laws\nwill prevent such lapses.\n\n   But Scott is convinced that as consumers become better informed,\nbusinesses will have all the incentive they need to improve their\nprotection of personal data. ``If you're going to violate the trust\nof your consumers,'' Scott says, ``I don't think you're going to be\nin business a very long time.''\n\n   Â  \nNYT-02-11-99 1455EST Â \n","Headline":"\nTHEY'RE WATCHING YOU \n","Text":["\n   No, you're not being paranoid.
