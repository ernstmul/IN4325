She may have survived up to this point\nonly because she ate less of the tainted meat, which either had\nbeen left or tossed into yards, police and the family said.\n\n   Kawadler said the 50-pound dog has been her husband Gerald's\nconstant companion for nearly a decade, often nestling by his feet\nbeneath the desk as he worked in the family's heating and\nair-conditioning business.\n\n   The Kawadlers' son, Stuart, said his father would even take Lucy\nto business conferences and record her as being present in his\nminutes of the meetings.\n\n   At the office, Lucy would share a turkey pocket with the\nreceptionist's dog everyday for lunch, except Friday, when they\nfeasted on Chinese food.\n\n   ``She is a funny dog,'' Stuart said. ``I don't know what kind of\ndemented mind could do this. They're not just pets, they're part of\nour family.\n\n   Other families had equally strong feelings for their poisoned\npets.\n\n   Molly, a six-year-old Labrador belonging to the Phillips family,\njust around the corner from the Kawadlers, had gone on many family\nvacations _ to Cape Cod, to New Hampshire, to Annapolis, Md.\n\n   ``My friends kind of expected if they invited me anywhere, Molly\nwas going to be there, too,'' chuckled Gary Phillips, as he fondly\nrecalled Molly. ``Yeah, she was a dog, but she was a great member\nof the family.''\n\n   Minard Culpepper said Sheba, his family's seven-year-old German\nShephard, usually barked when she wanted to come back into the\nhouse from the fenced yard.\n\n   On Saturday, when Culpepper didn't hear anything after what\nseemed like an hour Saturday evening, he went out to check on her\nand found her dead, blood trickling from her mouth.\n\n   ``She was a very protective dog,'' Culpepper said. ``She would\nbark at strangers.''\n\n   Another owner of a dog possibly poisoned by the serial killer,\nSusan Derrick, lives near Curry College, about a half-mile from the\nthree-block area where the other families live. She said her\nsix-month-old golden retriever, Rusty, was timid and would not have\nwandered far from her hilltop house.\n\n   That would have meant someone would have had to come near the\nhouse to leave the poison, since the house is set 150 feet back\nfrom the street.\n\n   ``It is a little more frightening to think someone would have to\ncome up here to do it,'' said Derrick.\n\n   Rusty also had violent seizures before dying on the kitchen\nfloor. But Fennessey of the MSPCA said her body already has been\ncremated, so tests could not be conducted to confirm poisoning.\nMeanwhile, Barbara Kawadler's voice shuddered with sorrow as she\nrecalled having to tell her daughter her dogs had died only hours\nafter her daughter had given birth. Then it swelled with anger at\nthe thought her own family could no longer feel safe in their home:\nThe poisoned meat was placed in the yard, she noted, where her\ngrandchildren often play on the swing set when they visit.\n\n   ``This could have been a child who picked it up, and if it was a\nchild, they would have called it homicide,'' said Kawadler.\n\n   The MSPCA is offering a $1,000 reward and the Kawadlers $500 for\ninformation leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of the\nperson or people responsible for the poisonings.
