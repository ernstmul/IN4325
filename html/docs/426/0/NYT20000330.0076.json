Going\nbeyond mere gall, the NRA is showing more cheek than a strip club\non Saturday night.\n\n   Except for locking up criminals after the fact, the lobby has\nconsistently opposed firearms legislation and has politically\nharassed federal enforcement of many of the very laws it now\npretends to wish were being more vigorously enforced.\n\n   It was the NRA, remember, that notoriously equated agents of the\nfederal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms with Nazi storm\ntroopers. It has portrayed federal law enforcement officers as\nbooted thugs kicking in the doors of innocent citizens.\n\n   Thanks in good part to NRA lobbying, we have laws that let\nconvicted felons regain their legal right to buy firearms. NRA\npressure led Congress in 1986 to enact the Firearms Owners'\nProtection Act, which, along with legislating other hobbles on\nenforcement, limits unannounced ATF inspections of gun dealers to\none a year.\n\n   More? Well, although it fought the Brady Act requiring\nbackground checks for gun buyers, the lobby now declares and\ndenounces a federal failure to charge all felons who try to buy\nguns they have no legal right to. But many of those supposed lapses\ncome under state, not federal, supervision of the law.\n\n   And the law, as the NRA knows, limits such prosecutions to\npersons who knowingly attempt to buy guns contrary to law. Even\nthen, more might be called to legal account if the short-handed ATF\ndidn't have to settle for cherry-picking the most dangerous\nviolators.\n\n   Where the ATF had 2,448 agents and inspectors in 1973, currently\nit is budgeted for 2,648 _ an increase of just 200 for very\ndifferent times. The NRA regularly lobbies against increases.\n\n   The NRA pushed for the huge loophole that leaves private gun\nsales unregulated, a means by which firearms are slipped to\ncriminals by legal but unscrupulous buyers who resell, no questions\nasked. It is fighting a Clinton administration proposal to close\nanother big loophole that allows gun-show sales without background\nchecks.\n\n   Maybe the administration isn't doing all it could to prosecute\ngun violators. It would take a complicated audit to find out. (Not\na bad idea, by the way.) But many violations can be prosecuted\neither under federal or state laws. It is apparently one of the\nNRA's tricks to count referrals to state prosecution as federal\ndefaults.\n\n   A congressional group is working up legislation that would add\n1,000 new state, local and federal prosecutors for gun crimes and\n500 ATF agents and inspectors, would increase dealer inspections\nand would improve record-keeping for domestic-violence offenders\nwho are ineligible to buy firearms.\n\n   The NRA's enthusiasm for this beefed-up enforcement is more\nhoped for than counted on.\n\n   Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.
