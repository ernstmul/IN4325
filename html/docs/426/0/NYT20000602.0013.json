Point B is the City Council ...\nemphasizing getting these stray dogs off the streets to make the\nstreets safe.''\n\n   Animal rights activists are outraged by the plan, saying the\naggressive push to reduce overcrowding is inhumane and does nothing\nto solve the problem of unwanted dogs in Los Angeles.\n\n   ``This is slaughter,'' said Laura Heisen of Agoura, a volunteer\nat the Los Angeles Animal Services East Valley kennel. ``I believe\nthat we do have a big problem with pack dogs in some parts of the\ncity, but what they're doing is not going to solve the problem.\nThey just want to make things nice for the reporters and the\npoliticians for the Convention.''\n\n   Currently, animal-control officials put up for adoption about\n200 dogs every day at each of the city's six kennels. Under the new\nplan, which could begin the second week of July, workers will hold\nfor adoption only about 61 dogs a day at each shelter, Knapp said\non Thursday.\n\n   Strays not suitable for adoption will be kept separately and\neuthanized after five to seven days.\n\n   Knapp said he does not know how many more dogs will be\neuthanized under the new plan, but that about 40 percent are put to\nsleep now because of illness.\n\n   ``We're in grief, and we're depressed. This is a hard decision\nto make. We exist to provide life, and we've all struggled with the\nreality,'' he said. ``The casualties will be that we will be\neuthanizing more dogs that would have been available for adoption.\nWe don't know how many.''\n\n   The crisis is so severe that Knapp estimates the kennels are\nnearly 200 percent over capacity.\n\n   By far the most cramped kennel is in South Central -- a\n1920s-vintage temporary shelter with a population of 7,845 dogs as\nof January. The second most crowded kennel is in the Northeast\nValley, with 5,183 dogs.\n\n   The Animal Control Department, with a nearly $13 million budget\nand approximately 50 animal-control officers, has struggled over\nhow to deal with the severe crowding for several years.\nAnimal-control officers catch nearly 8,000 stray dogs a year and\nreceive an additional 27,000 dogs as dropoffs.\n\n   Adding pressure is a law that took effect in January 1999 that\nforces cities and counties to provide more care for sick and\ninjured animals rather than euthanize them. It extended the\nmandatory hold period from three to seven days.\n\n   Last week, Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski recommended that\nofficials approve a $140 million bond measure on the November 2000\nballot to pay for five more kennels in the city and to refurbish\nthe other six.\n\n   ``We have reached a period where the animal population is simply\nout of control in the city,'' according to Miscikowski's deputy,\nGlenn Barr. ``Nobody likes to enhance the collection and\neuthanization of animals.''\n\n   Faced with attacks by pit bulls and other stray dogs citywide,\nthe City Council has pushed aggressive spay-and-neutering programs,\nincluding a new, higher fee for unaltered dogs.\n\n   ``Pacoima and the Northeast Valley have always been the highest\nranked areas (for) stray dogs, unfortunately,'' said Councilman\nAlex Padilla's spokesman, David Gershwin. ``There are far too many\nstray dogs on the street. We need to beef up and provide additional\nfunding, greater coverage for this chronic problem.''\n\n   Volunteers also established a Web site devoted to displaying\npictures of dogs offered for adoption.\n\n   Tia Maria Torres of the Villalobos Rescue Center, a Los Angeles\npit bull rescue group, believes there are other, longer-term\nsolutions to the problem.\n\n   ``There are so many humane groups (that) offer help fostering\nthese animals with aggressive adoption programs and volunteering to\nhelp train owners,'' she said.\n\n   ``This whole thing is like the major talk of the town right now.\nPit bulls are going to be the first to go.
