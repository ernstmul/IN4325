(jw) \n By JOEL BRINKLEY   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia,\nLatin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the United States\nunder false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes,\nabused laborers or servants, according to a CIA report that is the\ngovernment's first comprehensive assessment of the problem.\n\n   The carefully annotated and exhaustively researched, 79-page\nagency report _ ``International Trafficking in Women to the United\nStates: A Contemporary Manifestation of Slavery'' _ paints a broad\npicture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that\ngovernment agencies face in fighting it.\n\n   Completed in November, the report is based on more than 150\ninterviews with government officials, law enforcement officers,\nvictims and experts in the United States and abroad, as well as\ninvestigative documents and a review of international literature on\nthe subject.\n\n   Law enforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years\nof trafficking in immigrant women and children, some as young as 9.\nBut the report says that officers generally do not like to take on\nthese slavery cases because they are difficult to investigate and\nprosecute. What's more, it says, the nation does not have\nsufficient laws aimed squarely at this problem, meaning that the\npenalties often are insubstantial.\n\n   Two years ago, Attorney General Janet Reno chartered an\ninteragency task force to attack the problem, saying, ``We are not\ninterested in containing modern-day slavery; we want to eradicate\nit.'' The report mentions many efforts to fight the problem, but\nalso many barriers to doing so.\n\n   Over the last two years, while up to 100,000 victims poured into\nthe United States, where they were held in bondage, federal\nofficials estimated that the government prosecuted cases involving\nno more than 250 victims. The Justice Department said it could not\nprovide precise figures.\n\n   The report was prepared by a government intelligence analyst who\nwas working on assignment to the CIA. While the report is not\nclassified, it has not been made public. Another government\nofficial who wanted the report's findings publicized provided a\ncopy.\n\n   It describes case after case of foreign women who answered\nadvertisements for au pair, sales clerk, secretarial or waitress\njobs in the United States but found, once they arrived, that the\njobs did not exist. Instead they were taken prisoner, held under\nguard and forced into prostitution or peonage. Some of them were,\nin fact, sold outright to brothel owners, the report says.\n\n   ``Examples of this may include Latvian women threatened and\nforced to dance nude in Chicago,'' the report says. Thai women were\nbrought to the United States ``but then forced to be virtual sex\nslaves.'' Chinese-Korean women were ``held as indentured\nservants.'' And ``Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14,''\nwere promised jobs in housekeeping or child care but, upon arrival,\n``were told they must work as prostitutes in brothels serving\nmigrant workers.''\n\n   Girls from Asian and African countries, some as young as 9, were\nessentially sold to traffickers by their parents, ``for less than\nthe price of a toaster,'' one government official said. This mainly\nhappens in cultures where female children are not valued. The girls\nare smuggled into the United States where, in a typical case, they\nare forced to work ``in an indentured sexual servitude\narrangement,'' the report says.\n\n   A Nigerian smuggling ring, the report says, citing an\nImmigration and Naturalization Service case, charged parents from\nthat country $10,000 to $12,000 to bring their children to New York\nso they would have ``better educational opportunities.'' But once\nhere, the smugglers ``forced the Nigerian children to work as\ndomestics.''\n\n   Some of these cases received prominent news coverage when they\nwere discovered. But they are only a tiny fraction of the problem.\nThe report says 700,000 to 2 million women and children worldwide\nare victimized by traffickers each year. Although the numbers who\ncome to the United States are relatively small, the report says\nthat the problem ``is likely to increase in the United States.''\n\n   At a three-day conference in Manila, Philippines, last week,\ndelegates from 23 Asian countries met to discuss the problem and\ncalled on governments to seize the profits of the crime syndicates\ninvolved. A Filipino group estimated those profits at up to $17\nbillion a year.\n\n   Frank E. Loy, undersecretary of state for global affairs, told a\ncongressional subcommittee in February: ``It seems incomprehensible\nthat at the dawn of the 21st century, the primitive and barbaric\npractice of buying and selling human beings occurs at all. Yet\ninternational trafficking in persons, predominantly women and\nchildren, is a widespread and, by all indications, a growing\nreality.''\n\n   The countries that are the primary sources for traffickers are\nThailand, Vietnam, China, Mexico, Russia and the Czech Republic,\nthe report says. But other countries that are increasingly\nproviding victims include the Philippines, Korea, Malaysia, Latvia,\nHungary, Poland, Brazil and Honduras, the report says.\n\n   The INS, one of several federal agencies with jurisdiction in\nthis area, noted in an internal assessment last fall that agents\nhad found 250 brothels in 26 cities nationwide that appeared to be\nholding trafficking victims. It was not always easy to tell, the\nCIA report says, because the victims generally did not speak\nEnglish and might have been even more afraid of law enforcement\nofficers than of their captors.\n\n   After busting one of these brothels, the immigration officers\ngenerally move to deport the women _ the victims _ because they are\nin the country illegally. Often the officials do not have enough\ninformation to prosecute their captors.\n\n   nn\n\n   Government officials said the problem was not new, but the scope\nseems to have increased in recent years. The biggest reason is\nthat, since the mid-1990s, traffickers from Russia and the former\nrepublics of the Soviet Union have aggressively entered the\nbusiness, taking advantage of women from those countries who are\nlooking to the West for opportunities.\n\n   ``It's accelerated tremendously in the last 10 years,'' said\nDonna Hughes, director of the Women's Studies Program at the\nUniversity of Rhode Island. She has monitored the issue for a\ndecade. ``An important reason is that there's increased migration\nof women now for purposes of work.''\n\n   A CIA analyst derived the estimate of 50,000 victims per year\nfrom public and classified intelligence data, a government official\nsaid. No comparable estimates were made in previous years, the\nofficial said, but the widespread opinion among government\nofficials was that the number was much smaller 10 years ago.\n\n   One reason for the scrutiny now is that senior members of the\nClinton administration, including Secretary of State Madeleine\nAlbright and Attorney General Reno, in addition to the first lady,\nHillary Rodham Clinton, have spoken out on the issue.\n\n   ``We now have all of the other agencies involved, and we would\nnot have been able to do that without the sense that there is a\nmandate from the president to work on this issue,'' said Theresa\nLoar, a State Department officer who is also director of the\nPresident's Interagency Council on Women.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The task force that Reno established two years ago to coordinate\nfederal efforts to fight the problem meets every two or three\nmonths. It sponsors training seminars for law enforcement personnel\nand pilot projects for victims, among other efforts. The Justice\nDepartment set up a hot line for victims, staffed during business\nhours, Monday through Friday. Other federal agencies have started\nmodest programs, and an administration report says: ``The\nadministration is committed to taking decisive action toward\ncombating the trafficking of human beings, in a global effort.''\n\n   Other federal officials, and the report itself, say the\ngovernment's efforts are often fragmented and ineffectual. Many\nagencies have theoretical jurisdiction _ the FBI, the INS, the\nDepartment of Labor, the State Department, among others _ but none\nof them see trafficking of women and children as their clear\nresponsibility, or as a particularly desirable assignment because\n``investigating trafficking and slavery cases is arduous'' and\nunrewarding, the report says.\n\n   Federal, state and local law enforcement officers usually come\nupon trafficking cases while investigating other crimes. But ``many\nFBI agents say it is difficult if not impossible to formally write\nup the cases'' because of a lack of time, the report says. Even if\nthat were not so, ``there is no central repository of all the\ntrafficking in women and children cases within the United States,''\nit says. That would be a crucial requirement for an effective\nenforcement program.\n\n   Even when traffickers are convicted, the penalties are usually\nlight. In fact, there are few federal or state laws aimed directly\nat this crime. One federal law does forbid ``sale into involuntary\nservitude.'' It carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\nMany recent trafficking convictions have brought sentences that\nwere shorter than that.\n\n   In one case last year involving 70 Thai laborers ``who had been\nheld against their will, systematically abused and made to work\n20-hour shifts in a sweatshop,'' the report says, seven defendants\nreceived sentences of four to seven years; one received seven\nmonths.\n\n   ``These low penalties and the long, complicated and\nresource-intensive nature of trafficking cases tend to make them\nunattractive to many U.S. attorneys'' who have become ``frustrated\nthat the sentencing outcomes have not reflected the work involved\nor the full nature of the crimes,'' the report says.\n\n   Despite interest in the issue from the Clinton administration,\ngovernment officials said, few resources have been devoted to it.\n\n   ``We have hundred and hundreds of government analysts looking at\ndrugs, arms, economic issues,'' a government official said. ``But\nhardly anyone is on this.''\n\n   Two bills, in the House and the Senate, would increase prison\ntime for traffickers, provide assistance for victims and increase\nresources and training for law enforcement officers.\n\n   The bills would require the State Department to publish an\nannual report on trafficking and recommend sanctions against\ncountries that are not, in the administration's view, fighting it\naggressively enough. This would be similar to the annual State\nDepartment reports on human rights and drug trafficking. But the\ndepartment strongly opposes this idea, threatening the bills.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Although the CIA report was distributed within the government\nlast November, it does not appear to be getting much attention.\n\n   ``No one really knows what do with it,'' one government official\nsaid. ``I'm not sure people are really focusing on this.''\n","Headline":"\nA NEW FORM OF SLAVERY IS GROWING IN U.S., CIA REPORT FINDS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ As many as 50,000 women and children from Asia,\nLatin America and Eastern Europe are brought to the United States\nunder false pretenses each year and forced to work as prostitutes,\nabused laborers or servants, according to a CIA report that is the\ngovernment's first comprehensive assessment of the problem.\n","\n   The carefully annotated and exhaustively researched, 79-page\nagency report _ ``International Trafficking in Women to the United\nStates: A Contemporary Manifestation of Slavery'' _ paints a broad\npicture of this hidden trade and of the difficulties that\ngovernment agencies face in fighting it.\n","\n   Completed in November, the report is based on more than 150\ninterviews with government officials, law enforcement officers,\nvictims and experts in the United States and abroad, as well as\ninvestigative documents and a review of international literature on\nthe subject.\n","\n   Law enforcement officials have seen episodic evidence for years\nof trafficking in immigrant women and children, some as young as 9.\nBut the report says that officers generally do not like to take on\nthese slavery cases because they are difficult to investigate and\nprosecute.
