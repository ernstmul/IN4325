The justices\nare expected to render their decisions by July.\n\n   But the nine-member court might have to start its 1999-2000 term\nwith only eight justices on the bench. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\nappointed by President Clinton in 1993, is recovering from\ncolon-cancer surgery and might miss the first two weeks of oral\narguments, which begin Monday.\n\n   Ginsburg could still participate in the court's decisions, many\nof which might have broad significance for police, politicians,\npupils and pornographers.\n\n   For example, in an Illinois case being closely watched by police\nand civil rights groups, the high court will consider whether the\nConstitution allows police in crime-ridden areas to stop and frisk\npeople solely because they run upon seeing officers.\n\n   The case pits the interest of law enforcement against the Fourth\nAmendment right of people to be free from unreasonable searches.\nThe Illinois Supreme Court, in a ruling against the police, said\nSam Wardlow's decision to run from Chicago officers did not give\nthem sufficient reason to suspect him of having committed a crime\nor frisk him.\n\n   The search uncovered a firearm and led to Wardlow's conviction\nfor unlawful gun possession and two-year prison sentence, which the\nIllinois high court overturned.\n\n   In Illinois' appeal to the Supreme Court, the state argues that\npolice in dangerous neighborhoods nationwide would be hamstrung in\ntheir ability to fight crime if they were prohibited from chasing\npeople who bolt at the sight of officers. The Clinton\nadministration and the National Association of Police Organizations\nhave submitted briefs to the justices supporting Illinois'\nposition.\n\n   ``Unprovoked flight from identifiable police officers is\nordinarily a sufficiently valid indicator of illicit conduct to\njustify a brief investigatory stop,'' the administration wrote.\n``Although such flight may be undertaken for innocent reasons, it\nis not behavior in which innocent persons commonly engage _ and it\nis far more likely to signal a consciousness of wrongdoing and a\nfear of apprehension.''\n\n   But Wardlow counters that the constitutional rights of innocent\npeople would be jeopardized if police were allowed to search them\nsimply because they run. The NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund\nagreed in a brief to the high court.\n\n   ``Why an inner-city resident flees at the sight of a police\nofficer is at best ambiguous, and cannot by itself provide\nsufficient indicia that the citizen is about to commit a crime,''\nthe group wrote. ``Many residents in such communities, and\nparticularly minority members, have in the past been harassed by\nsome law enforcement officers and continue to suffer from such\nabuse. They possess a legitimate and reasonable fear of such\nofficials.''\n\n   Also before the high court is the issue of campaign finance,\nwhich has dogged Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican\npresidential candidate. The justices will consider in a Missouri\ncase, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government Political Action\nCommittee, whether a state law limiting campaign contributions for\nstate elections violates the First Amendment free-speech right of\ncontributors.\n\n   Bush has raised more than $50 million, angering party and\nDemocratic opponents who say he is bought and paid for by special\ninterests. Supporters of limits on campaign donations say the\ncontroversial restrictions are needed to prevent the appearance, if\nnot the reality, of political corruption.\n\n   In the case before the court, Missouri is urging the justices to\noverturn an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that struck\ndown the state's contribution limits as a violation of political\ndonors' right to free speech. Under the Missouri statute,\nindividuals may contribute at most $1,075 to candidates for\nstatewide office, $525 to candidates for state senate and $250 to\nstate representative candidates.\n\n   The Clinton administration, which is urging the justices to\nuphold the law, praised the campaign limits as a narrow,\nconstitutional way for states to ensure that elections are not\ntainted by the corruption that can be associated with large\ndonations.\n\n   But the Missouri political action committee, joined by longtime\nfoes the National Rifle Association and the American Civil\nLiberties Union, is pressing the justices to rule the state's\nrestrictions unconstitutional. The committee says political\ncontributors ``speak'' through their financial support for\ncandidates and that laws that limit their contributions infringe on\ntheir First Amendment right.\n\n   In considering the case, the high court will revisit its\nlandmark 1976 decision in Buckley vs. Valeo in which the justices\nupheld the constitutionality of a $1,000 limit for personal\ncontributions in federal campaigns. But the high court in recent\nyears has displayed unease with its 23-year-old ruling, increasing\nspeculation that the justices might scale back that decision and\npermit greater, if not unlimited, campaign contributions.\n\n   In another First Amendment case, which could affect political\nadvocacy on college campuses, the justices will decide whether a\nstate university can require students to make financial\ncontributions toward groups with whom they disagree.\n\n   In University of Wisconsin vs. Southworth, conservative law\nstudents are challenging the school's mandatory $331.50 activity\nfee, which helps support the gamut of campus organizations.\n\n   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the\nconservative students, saying the mandatory charge violates their\nFirst Amendment right to refrain from financing groups that espouse\nviews they find repugnant, such as abortion- and gay-rights\norganizations.\n\n   But Wisconsin, in its appeal to the justices, argues that a\nschool should be a forum for diverse views and, to ensure\ndiversity, it must assess fees on students. Wisconsin adds that the\nfee revenue is distributed to all campus groups, without regard to\nthe viewpoints they espouse.\n\n   The law students, however, counter that if the justices\neventually rule for the school, ``a state university could force\nJewish students to fund a Christian evangelical newspaper (and)\nforce African-American students to fund neo-Nazi or Ku Klux Klan\norganizations.''\n\n     \n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n   \nAll Texas state universities have mandatory student activity fees,\nsimilar to Wisconsin's, that go toward funding campus organizations\nwithout regard to the opinions they espouse.
