The agency also said it will have on hand more\nbomb-sniffing dogs and more uniformed police patrolling airports,\nboth inside and outside.\n\n   Meanwhile, beefed up patrols at the 301 points of entry into the\nUnited States, including in Maine and Vermont, have already yielded\ntwo arrests.\n\n   Bouabide Chamchi, 20, an Algerian with refugee status living in\nMontreal, and Lucia Garofalo, 35, a Canadian woman, were arrraigned\nTuesday in Burlington, Vt. on various immigration charges after\nbeing arrested Sunday night by US Border Patrol officers in\nBeechers Falls, in Vermont's northeast corner.\n\n   Holiday travelers are being urged to arrive at the airport at\nleast one hour before domestic flights and two hours before\ninternational flights, and to be prepared for strict enforcement of\nparking rules. They can also avoid inconvenience by not gift\nwrapping packages, the agency said, because they may have to be\nopened if something suspicious is seen by x-ray machines.\n\n   The moves by the FAA and the Border Patrol are the latest in a\nseries of steps taken by the federal government to respond to what\nofficials have described as a ``heighted security risk'' against\nAmericans coinciding with the new year and following the arrest in\nWashington state last week of Ahmed Ressam.\n\n   Ressam, 32, who authorities have identified as an Algerian\nnational traveling on fake Canadian identity papers and linked to\nextremists using Montreal as a North American base of operations,\nwas charged Friday in Seattle with carrying more than 100 pounds of\nbombing-making supplies and a sophisticated detonating device\nacross the border in a rental car.\n\n   Federal investigators are looking into whether Ressam was\naffiliated with any terrorist group, including the Islamic group\nlinked to exiled Osama bin Laden, the millionaire Saudi militant\nbased in Afghanistan for whose apprehension the US State Department\nhas posted a $5 million reward.\n\n   Ressam's arrest has sparked concern about domestic terrorism and\napparently precipitated a two-hour meeting Monday at the White\nHouse that included some of President Clinton's top advisers on law\nenforcement and foreign policy _ Secretary of State Madeleine\nAlbright, Attorney General Janet Reno, CIA Director George Tenet,\nand General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs of\nstaff.\n\n   White House Press Secretary Joseph Lockhart said Clinton did not\nattend the meeting, and he tried to play down its importance,\ndescribing the meeting as a routine gathering of officials who\nnormally discuss terrorism issues.\n\n   But, he said, ``I think we have made the case in the past that\nthe US is not invulnerable to domestic terrorism, but there's not\nspecific information now about particular targets here.'' He added,\n``I don't think there is a scare mode.''\n\n   He and other government officials continued to stress Tuesday\nthat they were unaware of any other specific threats against US\ntargets, other than the Seattle incident. However, they said the\nState Department's travel advisory, warning caution for Americans\ntraveling abroad for the holidays, still stands.\n\n   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the Defense Department\nhas sent two advisories to military installations and commanders\naround the world to help them make their own threat assessments and\nto devise plans to protect American forces.\n\n   Asked whether the Pentagon had taken any extra precautions or\nput any additional military assets on standby, Bacon responded,\n``Just let me say that we are taking apppropriate action.''\n\n   The State Department's deputy spokesman, James B. Foley, said\nthe U.S. Embassy in Quito, Ecuador, was closed Friday over concern\nit might be targeted by terrorists.\n\n   A senior State Department official said the agency plans to\nupdate the overseas travel advisory it issued 11 days ago, urging\nAmericans traveling internationally to take extra care and avoid\nlarge crowds. The official said that update, which will come late\nby Thursday at the latest, will include more details about the\nplans of 13 members of a terrorist group linked to bin Laden that\nJordanian authorities arrested last week, saying they were planning\nattacks against Americans and Israelis, among others.\n\n   The FAA, which issued its advisory in a statement, said the\nincreased security is not expected to cause airport delays, but\nwill be noticeable to passengers.
