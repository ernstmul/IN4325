The agency, formed in 1973,\nalso develops federal drug enforcement strategies and programs.\n      With its annual budget of $1.2 billion, the DEA also tries to\ndeter the drug trade through nonenforcement methods such as crop\neradication, crop substitution and drug prevention training of\nforeign officials.\n      By DOMINGO RAMIREZ JR. \nc.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram \n\n   DALLAS _ For 20 years, Julio Mercado has tracked the heroin\ntrade from Mexico to the Middle East, from the inner-city streets\nof New York to the suburbs of North Texas.\n\n   He has seen the purity level go from 1 percent to 90 percent,\nand the face of users change from hardened street addicts to\nbaby-faced teen-agers.\n\n   As an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mercado,\n49, has watched the federal agency constantly add resources to try\nto keep up with the changing heroin trade.\n\n   ``I hope I've made some difference,'' said Mercado, special\nagent in charge of the Dallas DEA office. He has made 700\ndrug-related arrests, most involving heroin.\n\n   ``Maybe we didn't get the dealer on every investigation I was\non, but I feel confident that in time that dealer was going to be\narrested by some agency,'' he said.\n\n   Mercado can trace the evolution of the heroin trade through\nvolumes of court papers on the agency's investigations during the\npast 25 years.\n\n   The source has changed: One investigation involved a\nMassachusetts heroin ring in the early 1980s that distributed the\ndrug nationwide, according to federal court records.\n\n   ``Our investigation led us to Lebanon, and that was the first\ntime we had seen heroin coming from there,'' he said.\n\n   Lebanon and Middle East countries remain sources of heroin for\nthis country, particularly in New York. But Mexico has become the\nNo. 1 heroin supplier in Texas, and Colombia is pushing out Asian\nsuppliers.\n\n   The dealers have changed: ``Back then, the big fish stayed in\nthe United States,'' Mercado said. ``Now, they're in foreign\ncountries shipping it here.''\n\n   The addicts: ``Users in the 1970s knew that they had to call 911\nimmediately to give their overdose friends a chance to survive,''\nMercado said. ``Users these days don't.''\n\n   The methods: ``Beepers weren't around back in the 1970s,''\nMercado said. ``If a dealer wanted to reach someone back then, he\nmay call or he would just walk into a neighborhood.''\n\n   The price: Five years ago, dealers were selling a kilogram of\nheroin for $180,000 to $240,000. These days, a kilo of heroin sells\nfor $700,000 to $800,000.\n\n   ``What all that has meant is that we've had to pour in more\nresources and work more with local and state agencies,'' Mercado\nsaid.\n\n   Some criminal justice experts, noting that 80 percent of federal\nmoney used in the war on drugs has gone to enforcement, say the\nspending is ineffective.\n\n   ``The DEA and other agencies deal with the suppliers, but you\nblock one artery and another will soon be created to supply the\nuser,'' said Sheila R. Maxwell, an assistant professor of criminal\njustice at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich.\n``Research has shown that curtailing the demand is much more\neffective.''\n\n   But law enforcement agencies say they rely on the federal help\nto bust major traffickers.\n\n   ``Our local drug agents can go after the street dealers, but we\nneed the DEA to go after the higher-ranking drug dealers,'' said\nPolice Chief Gary McKamie of Euless, whose department is a member\nof two DEA task forces, one in Fort Worth and another at\nDallas/Fort Worth Airport. ``The federal resources are just greater\nthan what we have locally.''\n\n   At times, a heroin investigation has meant nonstop work for six\nto eight months for DEA agents.\n\n   For Mercado, who was born in Puerto Rico and is the only member\nof his family in law enforcement, it's a beloved yet tedious\ncareer.\n\n   ``You woke up early in the morning to follow the heroin\ndealer,'' Mercado said. ``And you put him to bed at night. In\nbetween, you find out about his friends, the telephone calls, the\nrestaurants and all the other stops.''\n\n   At times, Mercado acknowledged, friendly relationships developed\nwith relatives of dealers.\n\n   ``You visit with a dealer at his home 10 to 15 times in an\ninvestigation,'' Mercado said. ``You play with his kids. You would\nfeel for the kids and wife.''\n\n   But Mercado said his job came first.\n\n   ``In time, you would remember what you were there to do,''\nMercado said. ``You would remember that this dealer is spreading\nall this poison. I had to make that arrest.''\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com)  \n","Headline":"\nTRACKING HEROIN IS AN EVER-CHANGING JOB\n","Text":["\n   DALLAS _ For 20 years, Julio Mercado has tracked the heroin\ntrade from Mexico to the Middle East, from the inner-city streets\nof New York to the suburbs of North Texas.\n","\n   He has seen the purity level go from 1 percent to 90 percent,\nand the face of users change from hardened street addicts to\nbaby-faced teen-agers.\n","\n   As an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mercado,\n49, has watched the federal agency constantly add resources to try\nto keep up with the changing heroin trade.\n","\n   ``I hope I've made some difference,'' said Mercado, special\nagent in charge of the Dallas DEA office.
