She found that\nflaws and gray areas allowed law enforcement agencies to circumvent\nstate statutes when they seized drug money.\n\n   Under the state constitution and state law, drug money that\npolice seized would normally go to public education.\n\n   Police must report the seized money to county prosecutors, and\nthe money is to be handled by state courts, which in most cases\nwould send it on for schools. Under some circumstances a judge may\ntransfer the money to a federal law enforcement agency.\n\n   The Kansas City Star reported last January that in many cases\ninvolving millions of dollars police simply gave seized money to\nfederal agencies, which kept part and returned the rest, usually 80\npercent, to police.\n\n   Following The Star's stories, several reform bills were proposed\nin the legislature, which appointed the joint committee to study\nthe matter.\n\n   Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat and co-chairman of\nthe committee, said Monday that he would introduce a bill Thursday\nbased on the recommendations in the report.\n\n   Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and committee co-chairman,\nsaid he would introduce a similar bill in the House next Tuesday.\nSome police officials have said their departments need the seized\nmoney to continue enforcing drug laws.\n\n   The report said the committee was sympathetic to both law\nenforcement's and education's need for the money, but money was not\nthe focus of the report.\n\n   The committee's ``overriding concern is the apparent neglect of\nthe state constitutional mandate,'' the report said. ``The failure\nto follow this clear directive has created an environment in which\nthe credibility of law enforcement is questioned.\n\n   ``Moreover, in bypassing the required judicial approval to\ntransfer the property to the federal system, it is possible that\nschools in the state, and ultimately taxpayers, are being deprived\nof the proceeds from some of these forfeitures.''\n\n   The report recommends that the legislature:\n\n   - Define when police seize drug money or property.\n\n   - Enact strict reporting requirements for both police and\nprosecuting attorneys.\n\n   - Put in place a penalty when police do not follow the law. The\ncommittee said the type of penalty was still to be debated.\n\n   - Require a state circuit judge to review how any drug money\nseized by state or local law enforcement is disposed of, even if a\nfederal agency initiated the case. ``This provision would require\nthat Missouri retain jurisdiction over any property seized in the\nstate, and that federal agents obtain judicial review in a Missouri\ncourt before the property could be transferred to federal\nauthorities,'' the report said.\n\n   Although the committee accepted the report unanimously, Wiggins\nand Kreider acknowledged that the report would probably be met with\ncontroversy because some lawmakers were likely to back law\nenforcement's desire to keep the money.\n\n   The committee agreed that one of the most critical\nrecommendations was defining when a seizure took place.\n\n   Police have argued that they are not violating state law,\nbecause when they find drug money they are not actually seizing it\n_ they are only detaining it until a federal law enforcement\nofficer can officially seize it and take it into custody.\n\n   Legal experts have scoffed at that explanation, and the report,\ntoo, was critical.\n\n   ``At its worst, such behavior has been characterized as a\n`game,'   '' according to the report.\n\n   The report recommends a seizure be defined as the point when a\nlaw enforcement officer ``discovers and exercises any control'''\nover property believed to have been used in a crime.\n\n   ``It will keep (law enforcement) from this Mickey Mouse sort of\nthing,'' said Sen. Larry Rohrbach, a California, Mo., Republican.\n\n   Another important step would be the reporting requirement,\nlawmakers said.\n\n   The report recommends police and prosecutors submit detailed\nreports of the money that is seized and forfeited to the state\nauditor. Each year the auditor would issue a report to the General\nAssembly.\n\n   Although some reporting already is required by state law, it has\nbeen spotty at best. Some law enforcement agencies refused to give\nthe state auditor seizure records last year.\n\n   No penalty was included for not filing a report, but the\ncommittee amended the report to include the need for either a civil\nor a criminal penalty, to be decided upon later. Currently there is\nno penalty when police do not follow state law.\n\n   ``A law is no better than your ability to enforce it,'' Kreider\nsaid.\n\n   Two other bills addressing the problem have been filed by\nlegislators who are not on the committee. One bill, which also\ndefines a seizure, has been introduced by Sen. Wayne Goode, a St.\nLouis Democrat.\n\n   A bill filed by Rep.
