With his 90 Saint\nBernards, he's counting on being at the forefront of the\nrevolution.\n\n   ``When China opens the dog meat market and dog breeding\nindustry, it will gradually become like raising cows and sheep,''\nsaid the middle-aged Zhang. ``As people spend more and their\ndietary habits change, industrialization of dog breeding will not\ntake as long as domestication of cows and sheep.''\n\n   He knows there's still a long way to go.\n\n   ``It's not easy to start a new industry,'' he said. ``Breeding\ndogs (for meat) has never been done on a large scale.''\n\n   Zhang oversees what he says is China's largest Saint Bernard\nbreeding center and the only one that is state-run. The famed\nmountain rescue dog is mated with local dogs to produce mixed-breed\ndogs that can then be sold for meat.\n\n   ``The advantage of the local dogs is they have a lot of lean\nmeat,'' said Zhang. ``The advantage of Saint Bernards is they're\nbig and grow fast and don't get sick.''\n\n   So far, Zhang's farm is only breeding dogs, not slaughtering\nthem. But he has plans to build what he says will be China's first\nlarge-scale dog meat factory.\n\n   After launching two years ago, the breeding center has become\none of the most profitable ventures of the state-owned Datong\nMining Bureau, the largest employer in this gritty city of 2\nmillion about 160 miles west of Beijing.\n\n   When the coal industry went into a slump a few years ago and\nstarted running out of money to pay workers, the government ordered\ncertain sectors to find outside revenue streams. Zhang, and a few\nother Datong Mining Bureau officials spent more than six months\nexploring possibilities before settling on dog meat.\n\n   ``Through market analysis and research, we discovered there was\na huge demand for dog meat,'' said Cui Liguo, a former coal\nindustry planner now in charge of managing the Saint Bernard\nbreeding center. ``There are a lot of consumers of dog meat and not\nmany breeders of dogs.''\n\n   The decision to use Saint Bernards was also arrived at after\nmuch scientific research, Cui and Zhang said.\n\n   ``To develop this industry you need a good breed. The local\nbreeds are not good enough,'' said Zhang. ``Chinese scientists have\ndone a lot of comparative research. The Saint Bernard was their\nfirst choice.''\n\n   In addition to being large - male Saint Bernards can grow to\nmore than 200 pounds - they are also very fertile, adapt well to\nvarious weather conditions and are easy to care for.\n\n   At Zhang's farm, a pair of puppies _ one male, one female _\nsells for $1,800 and has to be ordered months in advance. An adult\nSaint Bernard, which is cross-bred with other dogs to produce meat\nfor consumption, goes for $3,600 to $6,000.\n\n   Buyers include farmers and small businessmen who come from all\nover China hoping to make some money on the side by breeding dogs.\nThey are drawn by ads boasting of a high rate of return: three\ntimes as profitable as poultry and four times as profitable as\nraising pigs.\n\n   Zhang said the breeding center earned back its initial\ninvestment of $324,000 after just one year.\n\n   They stress that Saint Bernards are not for eating. Gao\nYuanping, head of the mining bureau's forestry division, said he\nknows dog lovers would howl in protest if it were thought Saint\nBernards were being killed.\n\n   Animal rights groups in Switzerland have tried to stop the sale\nof Saint Bernards to Asian countries. But Cui said Swiss dogs are\ntoo expensive anyway; most of their Saint Bernards come from Russia\nand Kazakhstan.\n\n   For American animal rights groups, however, the breed of the dog\nis a secondary issue. ``Like pigs, cows and chickens, all dogs are\nintelligent animals that deserve respect and not exploitation at\nthe hands of money-makers,'' said Cem Akin, a spokesman for the\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).\n\n   He said PETA is currently focused on a similar situation in\nKorea, site of soccer's World Cup in 2002. The group alleges that\nit is a common practice in Korea to consume dog meat after first\nbeating, torturing and strangling the dog to increase its\nadrenaline level. It is believed that this will make a man\nconsuming the meat more virile, Akin said.\n\n   Gao knows Americans don't eat dog meat.\n\n   ``For Americans, it's very strange,'' he said. ``Dog is man's\nbest friend.''\n\n   In the next breath, he said he welcomes investors from the\nUnited States or anywhere else to help them expand their\noperations.\n\n   ``They have to like dogs,'' he said enthusiastically.\n\n   Dog meat is thought to be nutritious and good to eat in the\nwinter because it heats up the body. Gao said every part of a dog\ncan be eaten except for the lungs. ``Heart of a wolf, lung of a\ndog,'' is a Chinese insult meaning cruel and savage. Some\nrestaurants offer a full banquet of up to 100 different dishes made\nfrom one dog.\n\n   ``Dog skin tastes very good,'' he added.\n\n   Whereas American palates rarely venture beyond the staples,\nAsians are far more adventurous diners, enjoying chicken feet, pig\nbrains and countless other dishes that would make Americans\nsqueamish.\n\n   Still, in Beijing and many other cities in China, dog meat is\nnot commonly eaten and is available only at a few restaurants. It\nis more popular in the northeast, which has a large ethnic Korean\npopulation, and Guangdong province in the south. More and more\nurban Chinese with disposable income are also keeping dogs as pets.\n\n   Cui, the general manager of the dog farm and once an avid\nconsumer of dog meat, said he has stopped eating dogs after working\nwith them.\n\n   ``I feel affection for them,'' said Cui, who had never raised\ndogs before his current job. ``Dogs have intelligence. They're not\nlike livestock. This is one of the reasons dog breeding has never\ndeveloped over these thousands of years. Dogs are smarter than\nother animals and they have feelings.

Gao asks\nworkers to let two out so they can demonstrate to a visiting\nreporter how dog breeding occurs.\n\n   But after 10 minutes of commanding and nudging and physically\nlifting of one dog on top of the other, the dog coupling was not to\nbe.\n\n   ``He just mated yesterday,'' Gao offered as an excuse for the\nstud's poor performance.\n\n   (EDs: Ends optional trim.)\n\n   To Zhang, cross-breeding Western and Chinese dogs is simply part\nof the trend towards globalization.
