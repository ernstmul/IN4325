But with the explosion of access to the Internet,\nlegions of pettier crimes are taking on a cybertwist.\n\n   A Santa Clara high-tech task force, for instance, recently found\nsomeone hawking rare stolen baseball cards on eBay. Federal\nprosecutors in Southern California have accused an Infoseek\nexecutive of trying to have sex with a teenage girl he met in a Web\nchat room. (The Lolita turned out to be an undercover FBI agent.)\nAnd a growing number of Californians are complaining about\ncyberstalking and online fraud.\n\n   Though many of the crimes are similar to those in the physical\nworld, experts say the Internet link raises a host of thorny\nissues: Many cops aren't trained to track down criminals over the\nNet. The Internet potentially makes it easier to commit a crime\nfrom thousands of miles away, crossing multiple state and national\nboundaries, and raising jurisdictional questions. And some experts\naren't sure whether juries will be as willing to convict defendants\nof committing a crime with a mouse instead of a gun.\n\n   To help settle the issue, at least 20 state attorneys general\n(and 200 staffers and other law enforcement agents) are expected to\nmeet today and tomorrow for a cybercrime conference hosted by the\nNational Association of Attorneys General. Organizers said U.S.\nAttorney General Janet Reno likely will give the keynote speech.\n\n   Several law enforcement agencies around California have already\nset up high-tech task forces to tackle the issue of cybercrimes,\nand Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he's been meeting with other\nofficials around the state to come up with ideas for how to fight\nhigh-tech crime. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis told Lockyer he will\nset aside some seed money in this year's budget, to be unveiled\nMonday, for high-tech task forces and efforts to fight cybercrime.\n\n   ``We are trying to develop a good game plan'' said Lockyer, a\nself-described computer aficionado who helped organize the\ncyberconference. Lockyer said sex crimes have gained plenty of\npublicity, but he thinks intellectual piracy and other economic\ncrimes will be a bigger target for prosecutors in coming years.\n\n   Lockyer said he's especially interested in the issue because\nhe's a longtime computer user _ he used punch-card computers in\ncollege in the '60s; has had a computer in his home for nearly a\ndecade; and even plays games like Myst, Riven and Halflife after\nwork, in addition to using more standard office programs.\n\n   But George Vinson, who started the FBI's West Coast high-tech\ntask force before becoming director of corporate security for\nBarkley's Global Investors in San Francisco, said most law\nenforcement officials aren't computer wonks and need more training\nto learn how to deal with cybercrimes. ``It's a big challenge,''\nVinson said.\n\n   In the past, Vinson added, local law enforcement agents could\nrely on the FBI to handle the trickle of hacking and other\ncybercrime cases. But the Internet is becoming so pervasive that\nthey need to take up some of the load. Plus, many of the crimes are\ntoo small for the feds to become involved. ``The states (and towns)\nhave to do it on their own,'' he said. Santa Clara County, for\ninstance, has set up a high-tech task force called REACT (Rapid\nEnforcement Allied Computer Team) with 11 agents, up from three\nwhen it became a formal group two years ago.\n\n   ``It's a growth industry,'' said task force agent Tom Quilty,\nwho is also a Santa Clara deputy sheriff. ``We could easily double\nour size and be busy. We've just scratched the surface.''\n\n   Quilty said law enforcement agencies face a particular problem\nbecause cops usually rotate into different departments frequently,\nthough it often takes a few years to learn the skills to handle\ncybercrimes.\n\n   Still, not everyone thinks the Internet will make cops' jobs\nharder.\n\n   Jonathon Zittrain, executive director of Harvard University's\nBerkman Center for Internet Society, points out that computers can\neasily be programmed to keep detailed records that law enforcement\ncould potentially check to track down criminals. And many Web sites\nmeticulously monitor everything about users _ from what Web sites\nthey visit to what they buy online _ so they can target their sales\npitches in the future.\n\n   Many of the developments, Zittrain says, are troubling from a\nprivacy standpoint but offer a mother lode of information for\npolice trying to track down a suspect.\n\n   Zittrain points to the recent case of the Melissa virus, which\nflooded e-mail systems around the country, forcing many companies\nto shut them down. Within days of the attack, federal agents had\narrested a suspect in New Jersey named David Smith, apparently\nbecause the Internet service provider he allegedly used had caller\nID. Plus, an independent computer guru in Massachusetts was able to\nfind David Smith's name hidden in original copies of the virus,\nrecorded automatically with a little-known feature of Microsoft\nOffice.\n\n   ``You'd have to be a pretty skilled and tenacious lawbreaker''\nto avoid detection in the future, Zittrain says.\n\n   To be sure, the Internet also makes it possible to harass Net\nusers or commit other crimes from tiny countries in remote parts of\nthe world, where criminals feel safe from prosecution. But Zittrain\npoints out that it is also just as easy to automatically warn\nInternet users about fraud, for instance, when they are dealing\nwith people in remote locales. And stalking victims might feel\nbetter if they know their attacker is thousands of miles away, he\nsaid.\n\n   Both Zittrain and Lockyer are scheduled to speak at this week's\nconference. In addition, the conference will feature a number of\npanels, including ones on what attorneys general are doing to\ntackle cybercrimes around the country, how current laws relate to\nthe Internet and how to ``create a family friendly Internet.''\n\n     (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   To be sure, a handful of sleuths have been tracking down hackers\nfor years.
