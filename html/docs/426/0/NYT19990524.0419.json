WREN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   After 39 years in law enforcement, Thomas Constantine abruptly\nannounced Monday that he would step down as the administrator of\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, which he has headed since\nMarch 1994.\n\n   Constantine said his decision was not motivated by political\nconsiderations. Now 60 years old, he said, he wants to return to\nNew York and spend more time with his family. But he has disagreed,\nsometimes forcefully, with the rest of the Clinton administration's\nportrayal of Mexico as a full ally in fighting the flow of drugs\ninto the United States.\n\n   Testifying before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics\nControl on Feb. 24, Constantine asserted that Mexican drug\ntrafficking organizations posed the worst criminal threat to the\nnation that he had seen in nearly 40 years in law enforcement. Two\ndays later, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that\nMexico was cooperating fully with the United States in\ndrug-fighting efforts.\n\n   Constantine's readiness to assail Mexico's record on drugs set\nhim well apart from other senior administration officials. But Gen.\nBarry McCaffrey, the White House director of national drug control\npolicy, who supported certifying Mexico, praised Constantine\neffusively Monday for ``his dedication, persistence, seriousness\nand integrity.'' McCaffrey said, ``He did a superb job as the\nnation's top drug cop.''\n\n   Constantine, who said he had planned to announce his retirement\nlast month, expects to leave office by July 1.\n\n   ``My sense with these things is to make it as quick as you can,\nand as short a time between when you announce it and you actually\ngo,'' Constantine said in an interview at the headquarters of the\nfederal drug agency in Arlington, Va. He added, ``What was also\nimportant for me was a strong reputation for integrity. I wanted to\nbe able to leave here with it.''\n\n   He declined to go into details.\n\n   Constantine was superintendent of the New York State Police,\nwhen President Clinton appointed him head of the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration on March 11, 1994. As administrator he added more\nthan 1,100 agents, raising the agency's total strength to more than\n9,000 agents and supporting employees.\n\n   McCaffrey said that Constantine had ``made an enormous\ndifference'' in refocusing the agency to give more assistance to\nlocal sheriffs and police chiefs who were fighting drug trafficking\nin their areas. This involved dispatching teams agents, who\narrested more than 8,000 suspected drug traffickers around the\ncountry.\n\n   Under Constantine, the drug agency also helped the Colombian\npolice dismantle the Cali drug cartel.\n\n   Constantine's successor has not been named. A likely candidate\nis the agency's deputy administrator, Donnie Marshall, a veteran\nagent who was previously the chief of operations.\n\n   Constantine said he hoped to return to New York to teach and to\nconsult for law enforcement organizations.\n\n   ``It is totally and completely a personal decision,'' he said,\nbut then hinted at a sense of isolation in Washington. ``I probably\ncould have stuck around to the end of this administration,'' he\nsaid, ``but it would be disingenuous.''    \n  \n","Headline":"\nDEA CHIEF ANNOUNCES HIS RESIGNATION\n","Text":["\n   After 39 years in law enforcement, Thomas Constantine abruptly\nannounced Monday that he would step down as the administrator of\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, which he has headed since\nMarch 1994.\n","\n   Constantine said his decision was not motivated by political\nconsiderations.
