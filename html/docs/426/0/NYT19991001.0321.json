They can take any property used in a felony.\n\n   Police see the forfeiture law as one of their most powerful\nweapons against crime. But a Palm Beach Post examination of how the\nlaw is used locally shows:\n\n   _ Sometimes innocent people lose their property. For example, if\nyou lend your car to someone to buy groceries and they get caught\nbuying crack instead, the police can take your car and you may not\nget it back.\n\n   _ Nearly half the people whose property is seized _ and a third\nof those who eventually lose it in court _ are not convicted of a\ncrime.\n\n   _ Poor defendants are hurt by the law more than the big-time\ndrug dealers and criminals who can afford to hire lawyers.\n\n   _ Even some police and their lawyers admit that police make\ndecisions on seized property based on money, not justice.\n\n   Seizing property has become standard police practice, one that's\nalso extraordinarily profitable.\n\n   Police in Florida collected $124 million this way from April\n1996 to March 1999 _ including $7.4 million seized in Palm Beach\nCounty, the third-highest total for any county. Millions more was\ncollected by federal authorities and shared with local police.\n\n   The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office hauled in $4.3 million,\nmaking it the most aggressive agency in the county. St. Lucie\nCounty authorities seized just over $1 million in that time, and\npolice in Martin County collected $501,000.\n\n   With this money, the police can bankroll long investigations,\nbuy high-tech equipment, meet state and federal grant goals, and\nassist crime prevention programs. Last year, for example, the Palm\nBeach County Sheriff's Office used $453,000 in seized assets to\nbuy, among other things, six video cameras for patrol cars, 10\nbullet-proof vests, 25 bicycles, and 27 ``less lethal'' weapons\nthat fire beanbags and polyurethane bullets. The sheriff's office\nalso donated $328,000 to various youth groups and anti-drug\nprograms.\n\n   Police are supposed to look at forfeitures not as a way to make\nmoney, but as a way to prevent crime by stripping criminals of\ntheir tainted wealth. But in practice, as the police and property\nowners duel over the stakes, nearly every move and counter-move is\nmade with money in mind: The police want to collect as much money\nas possible while spending little, and property owners try to get\nback as much as they can without placing themselves at risk in\ncriminal court.\n\n   ``It's like its own little ball park,'' said Catherine Kozol,\nlegal adviser to the Delray Beach Police Department. ``It's kind of\na game. I hate to say it that way, but it is. It's who can outsmart\nwho.''\n\n   The peculiar nature of forfeiture law has spawned a court system\nunto itself _ one that blends criminal issues with the rules of a\ncivil lawsuit. Defense lawyers say this system is harder on the\npoor than on high-powered drug traffickers. For every major seizure\nthat can be linked to a large drug organization, police seize\ndozens of cars from people in possession of small amounts of drugs,\nor those accused of a comparably minor crime.\n\n   ``The statute had some good intentions to punish the big-time\ntrafficker,'' said Stephen Melnick, a lawyer who once prosecuted\nforfeiture cases for the Boca Raton Police Department. ``But the\nonly one getting punished is the small-time user.''\n\n   ``They (police) use forfeiture law to raise money,'' said Jim\nEisenberg, a West Palm Beach defense lawyer who handles dozens of\nseizures every year. ``It's the most regressive tax that's ever\nbeen established. It's the poor that get hit the hardest.''\n\n   Once a seizure has been made, the owner is thrust into a\ncomplicated legal process separate from any criminal charges he may\nface.\n\n   In fact, the police can seize property without even arresting\nanyone. Forfeiture law is based on the premise that the property\nitself is at fault, regardless of who owns it. The standard of\nproof needed for the police to keep property is lower than the\nstandard necessary to make an arrest. Property owners must fight\nthe police at their own expense, and even those who are cleared of\ncriminal charges can lose their belongings.\n\n   A Palm Beach Post analysis of 678 seizures in Palm Beach County\nfrom 1996 to 1998 shows that property owners who have their\nbelongings taken by the police are found guilty in about 50 percent\nof the cases.\n\n   The Palm Beach Post analysis shows that this system can put the\npoor at a disadvantage. For example:\n\n   _ Defendants represented by the public defender in criminal\ncourt are more likely to lose their property entirely, because the\npublic defender is barred from handling forfeiture cases. Private\nlawyers hired to fight the criminal charges typically negotiate a\nsettlement with the police in return for the property.\n\n   _ Because they didn't have a lawyer, some defendants have lost\ntheir property for as little as a $5 crack rock, even though\nseizures over such a small amount of drugs could be considered an\nexcessive fine under the Constitution.\n\n   _ So-called ``innocent owners,'' those whose cars were used in a\ncrime without their knowledge, sometimes must pay an\n``administrative fee'' to get their cars back _ usually about $250.\n\n   _ Often the police will choose not to use the forfeiture law\nafter taking small amounts of cash _ but in many cases they still\nget to keep the money. The Delray Beach police have kept as little\nas $32 belonging to a defendant, calling the cash abandoned\nproperty after the criminal case has concluded.\n\n   Over the years, police in Palm Beach County have seized all\nsorts of items: guns, cameras, computers, boats, engines, cellular\nphones, Jet Skis, jewelry, even an airplane (which crashed with 777\npounds of cocaine on board) and a golf cart (the getaway car in a\nBoca Raton burglary). But cash and cars are the most common.\n\n   In St. Lucie County, the Sheriff's Office files just two or\nthree forfeiture cases a month. But because it often costs more to\nfile the cases than it's worth, the Sheriff's Office usually just\nlevies fees _ usually between $250 and $750 _ that suspects have to\npay to get vehicles back.\n\n   Most forfeitures stem from drug cases. Several times, state\ntroopers have found bundles of cash concealed in cars traveling on\nthe highway _ sometimes drug money is kept in a secret compartment,\nor it's wrapped in sheets of fabric softener to throw off\ndrug-sniffing dogs.\n\n   Of the 678 cases reviewed, the police found $10,000 or more in\ncash 62 times. Twenty-four of those came aboard Greyhounds or other\ninterstate buses, which are routinely searched by sheriff's\ndeputies looking for couriers moving drugs or cash for drug\ntraffickers.\n\n   Over that same time, 432 cars and trucks were taken by police.\n\n   ``The law is applied against whoever is caught with\ncontraband,'' said Jim Hicks, a lawyer who prosecutes forfeitures\nfor the Lake Worth police. ``It's disingenuous to say we are\npunishing the little guy when the little guy has $100,000 in his\ncar that he can't explain.''\n\n   LARGE DEPARTMENTS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE\n\n   The most aggressive police departments are typically the largest\n_ those with full-time attorneys. The sheriff's office and police\nin West Palm Beach, Delray Beach and Boca Raton account for 86\npercent of the assets seized in the county, according to state\nrecords.\n\n   For the most part, police use the seizure law in tandem with an\narrest; it's the exception when officers simply take property\nbecause they believe it's part of a crime. Of the 678 seizures\nreviewed, an arrest was made 86 percent of the time; in 75 percent\nof the cases, it was the owner who was arrested.\n\n   But there were 94 cases where property was taken even though no\none was arrested. And in 72 other instances, the owner had to pay\nthe police or lose his or her belongings even though the criminal\ncharges were dropped.\n\n   That's what happened to Jorge Ignacio Alvarez, 27, of South Bay.\nOn the night of July 1, 1997, Alvarez was driving home with a\ngirlfriend in his 1993 Mustang when he was pulled over because his\nlicense tag light was out. The deputy asked to search the car, and\nfound more than a half-pound of marijuana in a shopping bag under\nthe seat.\n\n   Alvarez and his girlfriend, Jennifer Baker, were charged with\nfelony marijuana possession. The charges against Alvarez were\ndropped after Baker was placed in a pretrial intervention program.\nBut that didn't help Alvarez get his Mustang back. After paying a\nlawyer to fight his criminal case, he had nothing left with which\nto bargain with the sheriff's office.\n\n   ``I just ran out of money,'' said Alvarez, who earns $11 an hour\nat a sugar mill. ``I thought that once they dropped the charges I\nwould get the car back ... I had just finished paying for it when\nit was taken.''\n\n   Alvarez now drives a 14-year-old Oldsmobile his grandfather\nbought for him for $800. His Mustang was later used by a sheriff's\ndeputy as an undercover car.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In south Florida, when police\ninvestigate a crime, they are thinking about more than just who\nshould be arrested and what the charges should be.\n","\n   They're also wondering if there's any property involved that the\npolice department can keep for itself.\n","\n   They do it all the time: grabbing a car used to drive to a drug\ndeal; snapping up tools used to strip a stolen car; taking money\nused to buy and sell drugs; or keeping a computer used to download\nchild pornography.
