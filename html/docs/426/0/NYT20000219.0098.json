Goldman was badly bitten, too, as he intervened.\n\n   ``The dog parks are not as safe as people think,'' Goldman said\nlast week. ``People don't know about the dangers of doggy parks.''\n\n   It certainly isn't the Westminster Dog Show.\n\n   In the past 12 months at the Sepulveda Basin Off-Leash Dog Park,\nthe city Recreation and Parks District has logged one call of a\nchild bitten by a dog, five dog-on-dog attacks and two calls for\nowners not taking reasonable control of their pets.\n\n   But Los Angeles police said they respond to an average of about\nfour dogfights per month at the Sepulveda Basin park. And at the\nBeverly Oaks Animal Hospital in Sherman Oaks, 20 to 50 dogs are\nbrought in each year that have been injured by other dogs at some\nof the city's five off-leash parks, said the manager of the pet\nhospital.\n\n   In some cases, customers bragged they bring their ferocious dogs\nto the parks to train them for fighting, said the manager, who\nasked not to be identified.\n\n   ``You get those punks who seek out dog parks. They go to these\nparks to field-test the fighting dogs,'' he said.\n\n   Lynn Stone, president of the advisory committee of the Sepulveda\nBasin Off-Leash Dog Park, said the problem of ruffians with vicious\ndogs has been solved.\n\n   ``I think at one time, that may have been true. Groups of guys\nwould come and bring pit bulls and fight them. We got that cleaned\nup pretty quickly,'' she said.\n\n   ``These parks have assumed risks. You can get knocked down. You\ncan get bit. And you can get peed on. Those kind of things\nhappen,'' Stone said. ``Occasionally, you see a person with an\naggressive dog, and we don't let them stay in.''\n\n   And some owners police themselves.\n\n   Frank Bonnell has lived across the street from the Sepulveda\nBasin dog park for a decade and has witnessed the fights. Because\nof the potential for problems, he keeps Josie Wales, his 2-year-old\nmastiff-Lab mix with a mean bark, away from the park - except on a\nrainy day when few dogs are around.\n\n   ``He gets dominant if other dogs get around him. He gets mad,''\nhe said. ``I love animals and I don't like to see dogs fight. But\nit happens. It's in their nature.''\n\n   It is largely up to the dog owners themselves to make sure their\ncanines and others are safe.\n\n   Rules are posted on signs at the front gate, but not everyone\nabides by them, officials said. And no city workers are permanently\nstationed at the park, leaving it up to dog owners to police\nthemselves on the five-acre field that has a fenced-off area for\nsmaller and more timid dogs.\n\n   Up to a dozen volunteers - including Stone herself - are there\nto supervise the dogs. But they have no set schedule, Stone said.\n\n   Charles Shorts, acting chief park ranger for the city's\nRecreation and Parks Department, said his rangers act immediately\nwhen hearing about a dogfight.\n\n   ``It's community involvement. They need to report to us ongoing\nproblems and we will respond to it immediately. We try to monitor\nall the facilities the best we can,'' Shorts said.\n\n   But the reality is whatever action is taken is usually left up\nto the owner's discretion, Stone said.\n\n   Some owners choose to share the vet bill, others go to small\nclaims court.\n\n   Stone recalled one case years back in which Judge Wapner of TV\ncourt fame ruled in favor of three Irish wolfhounds who attacked a\nsmall dog at the Sepulveda Basin park. He determined that the\nsmaller dog should have been placed in the smaller dog park area.\n\n   Even the regular park visitors who report few problems want more\nconsistent supervision to prevent fights.\n\n   Sitting in a lounge chair under a tree at the park with her pet\nbeagle, Mollie, snuggled on her lap, Paula Goldstein said she had\nseen dogfights as recently as a week earlier. In one of the two\nfights, two men started throwing punches, she said.\n\n   ``I think there should be somebody here at all times,''\nGoldstein said.\n\n   Cheryl Stengel of Reseda brings her 5-month-old Catahoula\nleopard breed dog to the park every day to ``socialize him,'' even\nthough her other dog was attacked by a pit bull at the Laurel\nCanyon Off-Leash Dog Park a few years ago.\n\n   ``Some dogs make me nervous the whole time I'm here,'' she said\nat the Sepulveda Basin park. ``I think there's a lot of machoism\ninvolved here - who's got the tougher and bigger dogs,'' she said.\n\n   Other dog owners brush off the fights as doggy roughhousing.\nSome people indulge in letting their pets run free as they sit in\nlounge chairs socializing with their friends.\n\n   They exchange recipes, meet dating partners, host canine\nbirthday parties and arrange play dates for their pets.\n\n   ``This is like a little piece of heaven. It's great. Everybody\nknows everybody. They need more of these around,'' said Jay Crane,\nwho travels 1 hours from his Frazier Park home once a month to the\npark with his two dogs, including a pit bull mix named Barbie.\n\n   Here are some tips and rules to make sure your visit to one of\nthe city's five off-leash dog parks is safe for you and your dog:\n\n   - If your dog is aggressive, don't bring it to the park.\n\n   - Report aggressive dogs immediately to rangers at (323)\n913-7390.\n\n   - Do not bring in female dogs in any stage of heat.\n\n   - No dog or human food allowed inside park.\n\n   - If dogs get into a fight, avoid sticking your hands between\nthem. Rather, try to have a person grab each dog by the hind legs\nto pull them apart.\n\n   - Carry an air horn to distract fighting dogs. When using it,\nhold it up in the air, rather than further agitating the dog by\nblowing it in the dog's face.\n\n   - Place a harness on your dog to more easily lift your animal\naway from a fight. Spiked collars can also be placed on the dog to\ndiscourage other dogs from biting in the neck area.\n\n   - Keep small and timid dogs in the smaller play area of the\npark.\n\n   - No more than three dogs allowed per person.\n\n   - Dogs under 4 months old are not allowed.\n\n   SOURCE: Los Angeles City Department of Recreation and Parks\n","Headline":"\nDANGERS OF OFF-LEASH DOG PARKS TOLD\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Alan Goldman had always looked forward to taking\nhis corgi-Lab mix, Joy, to frolic in the dog park with other\npooches.\n","\n   But their fun turned into horror last week when a pit bull mix\ntwice Joy's size tried to steal her Frisbee, burying his fangs in\nher neck.
