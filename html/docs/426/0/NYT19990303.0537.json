Times News Service   \n \n\n   NEW YORK _ It was 9 a.m., give or take a minute or two, and a\ndozen dog owners at 91st Street in Riverside Park grimly snapped\nleashes in place Wednesday, remembering the scene the morning\nbefore, when mounted officers had given chase and apprehended those\nwho had missed the on-the-leash deadline.\n\n   One dog owner, Judith Schwarz, spotted two mounted Parks\nDepartment rangers waiting just outside the park and loudly\nimitated a trumpet heralding a cavalry charge. ``They're keeping\nthe park safe from dog terrorists!'' she shouted, referring to the\nterm used by the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern, for those who\nflout leash laws.\n\n   One of the rangers, J.D. Cohen, reminded Ms. Schwarz that dogs\nare allowed to run free _ in certain areas of the park _ only\nbetween 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., and informed her that she had not made\nit under the 9 a.m. wire.\n\n   Grudgingly, Ms. Schwarz gave her name and address, then\ngratuitously volunteered her Social Security number, blood type and\nthe names of her pooches, Roxanne and Blue. Not to mention a\npointed comment or two about arbitrary abuses of power in a city\nshe called Giulianiville. Cohen responded by handing over a summons\nthat fined her $100 for each dog.\n\n   It was the sixth day in the city's campaign to bring errant\nhounds, poodles and spaniels to heel. The city is increasing\nenforcement, raising fines and creating a corps of civilian\ninformers who will carry portable phones to report violations of\nthe leash law. While neighboring police precincts may soon become\ninvolved, the initial crackdown is concentrating on Central and\nRiverside Parks, where, the Parks Department estimates, dogs cause\n$250,000 in damage annually.\n\n   ``The campaign is directed against a small minority of willful,\narrogant dog owners,'' Stern said. ``They're like die-hard National\nRifle Association members.''\n\n   The NRA comment almost seemed calculated to infuriate the dog\nfolks, who like to portray themselves as embattled civil\nlibertarians with furry best friends. ``They're acting like the\nGestapo,'' said a man who said he feared municipal retribution and\nwould identify himself only as Lou. He did, however, reveal the\nfull name of his beagle: Wonder Dog.\n\n   The authorities say the crackdown appears to be succeeding. A\nsurvey by Parks Department workers in Riverside Park found that on\nthe first three Saturdays of February combined, about 200 of the\n300 dogs in the park were off leash.\n\n   But last Saturday just 13 of 97 were, said Ed Skylar, a Parks\nDepartment spokesman. The department said that more than 200\nsummonses had been issued since the effort began Friday, compared\nwith 1,005 in all of last year. ``People obey the law when they\nhave to,'' Stern said.\n\n   Moreover, the commissioner said, the crackdown was drawing\nsupport, with mail running 3-to-1 in favor of the tougher\nenforcement.\n\n   The next stage of the campaign will be to pass out portable\nphones to volunteers, who will be instructed to try to persuade\npeople to leash their dogs before tattling on them. Other parks,\nthe first of which will probably be Prospect Park in Brooklyn, will\nalso be concentrated on, Stern said.\n","Headline":"\nNEW YORK CITY EXPANDING CAMPAIGN AGAINST OWNERS OF UNLEASHED DOGS \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ It was 9 a.m., give or take a minute or two, and a\ndozen dog owners at 91st Street in Riverside Park grimly snapped\nleashes in place Wednesday, remembering the scene the morning\nbefore, when mounted officers had given chase and apprehended those\nwho had missed the on-the-leash deadline.\n","\n   One dog owner, Judith Schwarz, spotted two mounted Parks\nDepartment rangers waiting just outside the park and loudly\nimitated a trumpet heralding a cavalry charge. ``They're keeping\nthe park safe from dog terrorists!'' she shouted, referring to the\nterm used by the parks commissioner, Henry J.
