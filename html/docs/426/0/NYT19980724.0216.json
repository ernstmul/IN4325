Times News Service clients)  \n By RICHARD NILSEN  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   UNDATED - It has been said that there are two kinds of people in\nthe world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and\nthose who do not. But I've never met any of the latter.\n\n   Everybody and his brother-in-law splits the world into two\ncategories: male and female; conservative and liberal; Gene Autry\nfan and Roy Rogers fan; those who get it, and those who don't.\n\n   Underlying every other distinction, however, is the basic,\nfundamental one: between dog and cat. Every animate being on the\nplanet is one or the other.\n\n   Once you've come to this understanding, you can see it in the\nfaces of everyone around you.\n\n   They are opposed personality types. They function in the world\ndifferently and see the world differently.\n\n   For the dog, the world is essentially simple. Truth is truth, up\nis up and down is down. The dog has a direct relationship with the\nthings of the world: They are what they are.\n\n   A cat, on the other hand, sees the world metaphorically. Things\nare never only what they seem. They can mean one thing Monday and\nsomething entirely different on Tuesday.\n\n   When dogs read poetry, they like to read, ``what oft was\nthought, but ne'er so well expressed.'' Their word is their honor\nand they have 30-year mortgages.\n\n   There are many kinds of dogs in the world. Some are bureaucrats\nand some, the more stylish, wear whatever is touted in ``Esquire.''\nSome are noble and become doctors or missionaries; others bring my\nslippers at day's end.\n\n   It is plain, especially to dogs, that the world functions only\nbecause of them.\n\n   But cats have eyes that change as the moon changes. They live by\ntheir own rules and amend them as their mood shifts. They are\nfilled with prevarication and treachery. Their minds shuffle like a\ngambler's deck of cards, and we never know what face will show, or\nwhat suit. ``Spades and Diamonds, Courage and Power; Clubs and\nHearts, Knowledge and Pleasure.''\n\n   When it comes to poetry, cats often prefer to write their own.\n\n   There can be little meaningful dialogue between the dog and the\ncat, because they mean different things when they use the same\nword.\n\n   This frustrates the dog no end; he cannot pin the cat down,\nwhile the cat delights in the ambiguity, and will even do what he\ncan to amplify it.\n\n   Dogs are trustworthy. A dog will be on time; a cat will be late,\ncancel or forget.\n\n   A dog joins the Rotarians; a cat never does, unless he can use\nhis membership toward the end of world domination, or something\nelse he thinks might be fun.\n\n   Among women, cats can wear too much eye makeup; dogs put too\nmuch lacquer in their hair. The difference is total and complete.\n\n   For instance, a dog can certainly be selfish, but it takes a cat\nto be egocentric. A telling difference.\n\n   Dogs have faith in the basic goodness of the world, and although\nthey make a place for evil, they nevertheless believe it is\nsomething that can be overcome. A cat may or may not believe in\nevil, but whatever else, he believes in the relativity of goodness\nand truth.\n\n   This isn't just people: All animals are also dogs or cats. Think\nof a sea otter. Cat or dog? There can be no question. Anything that\ncan sleep floating on the ocean surface so curled up that its head\nrests comfortably on its own belly is a cat. Sturgeon are dogs. So\nare bears, horses, elephants and cows _ ungulates as a class are\ndogs.\n\n   It is interesting to see this play out in nature. Don't be\nconfused by taxonomy. It is not names that define dogness and\ncatness. Foxes, for instance, are classified as canines by the\ndoggy scientists, but they are nevertheless cats. And cheetahs _\nyou only have to look at those stiff, tensioned legs to recognize\ntheir essential dogginess.\n\n   The main physical difference is in their bendability. Pick up a\ndog by his middle and what do you feel? The beast is stiff as a\ntwo-by-four. He is uncomfortable off the ground. He whimpers. Put\nhim back down and his tail wags.\n\n   Pick up a cat, and it drapes over you, form-fitting and at ease.\nI know a man who used to wear his big orange cat as a kind of\nliving Davy Crockett hat. The cat sagged over his skull and down\nhis neck and never wavered. The cat just purred.\n\n   You can tell the relative caninicity or felinicity of a person\nwhen you dance some old-fashioned thing like a waltz. If your\npartner's spine is rigid, he or she is a dog. A cat-partner will\nswing and sway with the rhythm like a willow in a gust.\n\n   Does anyone remember seeing archival TV film of Richard Nixon\nattempting the Twist? The very definition of a dog.\n\n   That is because a dog is all of a piece; he is one thing, head\nto tail. A cat is a loose concatenation of impulses, a pile of\nmultiple personalities. When a dog dances, every part of him has to\nmove in the same direction at the same time. A cat is syncopated.\n\n   This pervades their world views. A dog is regimented and feels\nmost comfortable when most conventional. A cat is individual and\noften takes little notice of what is expected of him.\n\n   Think of the American Revolution. The redcoats, marching in\nrank, were dogs; the Americans, taking potshots at them from the\nwoods, were cats.\n\n   Groucho Marx, taking his potshots, is the quintessential cat. If\na canine becomes too officious, a cat is always there to flick his\ncigar ash and wiggle his eyebrows. Although dogs do not understand\ncats, cats understand dogs all too well.\n\n   Interestingly, although almost all politicians are dogs, the\nmost effective religious evangelists are cats. They don't actually\nbelieve what they say, but they get a great deal of pleasure from\npersuading listeners to line up behind them, cheering (and sending\nmoney).\n\n   Or rather, the cat believes what he is saying as he says it. It\nis just that tomorrow, he can say something else. I'm thinking of\nMarjoe Gortner, for instance, or Lyndon Larouche. A foolish\nconsistency, they rejoinder.\n\n   A true cat will really enjoy making one argument now, then\nswitching hats or podiums, proving himself wrong in the next\nbreath. The pleasure is in the arguing, not the results. Strife is\nthe natural order of things.\n\n   This makes dogs very, very uncomfortable. For the dog, arguments\nare proof that the world is out of balance. Equilibrium must be\nrestored: The two sides in a dispute must work it out, so the truth\nwill prevail and peace _ the dog's natural order of things _ will\nre-emerge.\n\n   The dichotomy is at the bottom of some of the most familiar\ncultural pairings we know. Benjamin Franklin, with his ``early to\nbed, early to rise,'' was a dog; Thomas Jefferson, with his house\nfilled with maps and stuffed elk, inventive contraptions and lack\nof heat, was a cat.\n\n   Tolstoy was a dog; Dostoevski was a cat. Hemingway went woof\nwoof; Faulkner, meow.\n\n   The very earliest organized philosophies broke down along these\nlines. Plato was a cat. Even now, you can never know for sure when\nhe actually believes some of the piffle he comes up with.\nAristotle, on the other hand, was the very model of a dog. ``Let's\nmake lecture notes.''\n\n   When it comes to marriage, a dog can be happy married to a dog.\nBut a cat can be happy married to either a cat or a dog. There is\nfun either way. But you see, there is a built-in paradox. How many\nmarriages do you know where one party is happy and the other isn't?\nThe reason, I tell you, is always the same: One dog, one cat.\n\n   Two cats mated can be happy briefly. But such marriages don't\ntend to last. Think of a Hollywood marriage and you pretty much get\nthe picture. Variety is not just an ideal for a cat but a way of\nlife.\n\n   Of course, the arts are heavy with cats, just as the field of\naccounting is not. You don't last long at H&R Block if you believe\narithmetic is a matter of opinion.\n\n   At bottom, we need both animals in the world. You need the dogs\nto make life possible; you need cats to make it worth living.
