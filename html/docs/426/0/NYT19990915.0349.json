Wolf refused to drop any charges against\nFlemmi, Bulger, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis P.\n``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, and two associates, or to toss out a\nkey piece of evidence -- a 1989 bugging of a Mafia induction\nceremony in suburban Medford.\n\n   After 46 witnesses, 276 exhibits and 80 days of testimony that\nstretched over most of last year, Wolf was unswayed by Flemmi's\ncentral claim: He and Bulger were promised immunity from\nprosecution for any crime short of murder in exchange for\ninformation they fed the FBI on their Mafia rivals.\n\n   In a one-inch thick, 661-page decision, Wolf concluded that the\nFBI broke its own rules while handling Bulger and Flemmi, but that\nany agreement with the pair did not rise to the level of a formal\ndeal not to prosecute them.\n\n   While Wolf did not dismiss any charges, he did bar federal\nprosecutors from using any evidence gathered against Bulger or\nFlemmi during a series of buggings in the 1980s because they had\ngiven the FBI information that it used in applications for the\nbugs.\n\n   Still, any victory for prosecutors may be shortlived. Wolf said\nhe plans to hold more hearings on whether information from four\nbugging operations was presented to the grand jury that handed down\nthe racketeering indictment against Flemmi and the others in\nJanuary 1995.\n\n   If it was, Wolf said he may throw out some or all of the charges\nagainst the 65-year-old Flemmi.\n\n   ``The bottom line is it's very good news for Mr. Flemmi,'' said\nhis attorney, Kenneth J. Fishman. ``I certainly will be urging the\ncourt that there really is no way for this indictment to survive as\na result of the evidence that is being excluded against Mr.\nFlemmi.''\n\n   Salemme's lawyer, Anthony Cardinale, said he will ask Wolf next\nweek to release Salemme on bail.\n\n   Cardinale said it was Salemme and reputed Mafia solider Robert\nDeLuca who pushed Flemmi to reveal that he was an FBI informant.\n\n   ``It was important for us, and certainly for my client, for the\nworld to know that this wasn't sleuthing that was going on,'' said\nCardinale. ``It was nothing but outright rat snitching and it was\naccomplished by a guy who professed to be one of (Salemme's)\nclosest pals.''\n\n   US Attorney Donald K. Stern, whose office is prosecuting the\ncase, issued a statement saying he was ``pleased'' that Wolf denied\na request by defense attorneys to dismiss the indictment or\nsuppress FBI tapes of the induction ceremony.\n\n   ``Needless to say, I am disappointed that the court is requiring\nthat further evidentiary hearings be held before it can make final\nrulings on Flemmi's motions,'' Stern said.\n\n   Both Stern and Barry Mawn, special-agent-in-charge of the FBI's\nBoston office, said they are continuing to investigate allegations\nof FBI misconduct that surfaced during the hearings before Wolf\nlast year and were chronicled in his lengthy decision.\n\n   Although Flemmi became an FBI informant in 1965, followed by\nBulger a decade later, Wolf wrote that the FBI ``played a pivotal\nrole in forging a formidable enduring partnership between Flemmi\nand Bulger. ... The FBI made Bulger and Flemmi, who were previously\nacquainted but not close, a perfect match.''\n\n   Indeed, Flemmi testified that he had stopped meeting with the\nFBI for a few years when Bulger arranged for him to meet his\nhandler, Special Agent John Connolly, in 1976. At the time both\nFlemmi and Bulger were reputed members of the Winter Hill Gang,\nbased in Somerville, just outisde of Boston.\n\n   They became a team, allegedly shaking down bookmakers and drug\ndealers together, then rendezvousing with agents to provide\ninformation on the criminal exploits of their Mafia rivals.\n\n   ``The arrangement offered (Flemmi) an opportunity to use the FBI\nto disable his enemies, enhance his safety, and with the\ncompetition diminished and the protection of the FBI, make his own\ncriminal activities more profitable,'' Wolf wrote.\n\n   There was ample evidence that Bulger and Flemmi were protected\nover the years by many agents, said Wolf, citing the testimony of a\nparade of former FBI agents, prosecutors and underworld operatives.\n\n   Wolf said he was unable to rely on FBI records found in the\ninformant files of Bulger and Flemmi because there was\n``substantial evidence that members of the FBI engaged in improper\nif not illegal conduct'' and had a motive to tailor, omit or\ndistort the records.\n\n   Therefore, Wolf said, he was drawing conclusions from some of\nthe testimony. Among his stunning findings: he believes that\nConnolly, who retired in 1990, warned Bulger and Flemmi on the eve\nof their January 1995 indicment so they could flee.\n\n   Bulger left and remains a fugitive, named recently to the FBI's\nTen Most Wanted list.\n\n   Wolf said Flemmi's testimony that it was former FBI Supervisor\nJohn Morris who warned Bulger to flee just wasn't ``credible.''\n\n   In a statement Wednesday, Connolly said, ``I did not tip Bulger,\nFlemmi or anyone else with repsect to the indictment returned by\nthe grand jury in 1995.''\n\n   While Connolly refused to testify at the hearings last year\nciting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Morris\nwas granted immunity from prosecution.\n\n   Morris admitted pocketing $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger and\nFlemmi and claimed that Connolly delivered two of the payments,\neach totaling $1,000.
