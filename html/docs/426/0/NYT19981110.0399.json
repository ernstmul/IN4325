Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI _ U.S. customs officials seized about 1,600 pounds of\ncocaine from a Colombian air force cargo plane that landed on\nMonday at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, prompting\nColombia's air force chief to resign on Tuesday.\n\n   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, called\nthe case ``disturbing'' and said investigators were trying to sort\nout who loaded the plane in Colombia and who had access to it\nbefore it arrived at 2:30 p.m. with a crew of six and five\npassengers.\n\n   Kelly said that foreign military airplanes regularly flew into\nthe United States with supplies and personnel for embassies and\nconsulates, or for specific missions, and that his agency routinely\nasked permission for random searches.

A drug-sniffing dog confirmed the\ninspectors' suspicions.
