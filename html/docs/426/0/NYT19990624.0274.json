Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the\nlegislation is needed to remedy what he saw as an ``oppressive\ninstrument'' used to abuse the rights of innocent people.\n\n   ``This bill puts civil liberties and due process back into our\njudicial system,'' Hyde said during a floor debate on the measure.\n\n   It would dramatically overhaul the nation's civil forfeiture\nlaws, which allow federal agents to seize the assets of suspects\nwithout a hearing, a trial or even an arrest _ and often allow the\ngovernment to keep the assets after suspects are acquitted or their\ncases are dropped without an arrest.\n\n   In addition, civil forfeiture laws require defendants to prove\nat their own expense that their property was never linked to any\ncriminal activity if they want to get it back.\n\n   The overwhelming majority of seized properties are associated\nwith drug cases.\n\n   Critics of the laws contend that hundreds of innocent people\nhave been victimized by overzealous federal and state law\nenforcers, who view seizing money and property as a way to stop\ndrug dealers _ and to fortify their budgets. Hyde pointed out that\nin most cases, the assets seized go directly to the state or local\nagency that made the bust.\n\n   ``It'd be like traffic cops got half of every ticket they wrote\nout,'' he said.\n\n   According to the Justice Department officials, in the past\ndecade the federal government has averaged $500 million a year in\nseizures, mostly in cash, but also in property such as cars, boats\nand planes.\n\n   ``They can take your home, your farm, your car, most anything\nyou own without even proving that you have broken the law,'' said\nRep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who said 80 percent of those whose\nproperty is seized are never charged.\n\n   The bill's fate in the Senate remained unclear. No similar\nmeasure has been offered there, but a spokeswoman for Judiciary\nChairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he is looking at introducing a\nbill.\n\n   Among the incidents cited as reasons to change the law were:\n\n   _ Richard Apfelbaum, a salesman from Sunshine, Fla., flying to\nLas Vegas in 1992 with $9,640 in cash to use for gambling, was\nstopped during a layover at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport by Drug\nEnforcement Agency officials who were suspicious of his one-way\nticket. They asked to search his bag, and he agreed. They seized\nhis money, concluding that such a large sum of cash must be related\nto illegal drug activity. But Apfelbaum was not detained or charged\nwith any crime.\n\n   For several months, he tried to retrieve his money, posting the\nrequired 10 percent bond and spending $2,000 in attorney's fees. In\nthe end, Apfelbaum gave up, saying, ``I'm not in a position to\nspend $10,000 in legal fees trying to get $9,000 back.''\n\n   _ A Los Angeles man, Hosep Bajakajian, traveling to Syria in\n1994 had to go to the Supreme Court to get back $357,144 seized by\ncustoms officials. The cash was not tied to any crime and it would\nhave been legal to take it out of the country if Bajakajian had\nalerted authorities that he was carrying more than $10,000. Noting\nthe maximum criminal penalty for the offense was $5,000, the high\ncourt overturned the seizure in 1998 for being ``grossly\ndisproportionate'' to Bajakajian's conduct.\n\n   Hyde's bill has drawn support from unusual array of ideological\nopposites.
