The study, which Congress\nmandated, called for the creation of a federal task force of 13\nrepresentatives from agencies involved in fighting narcotics.\n\n   U.S. anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet\nReno, in announcing the group's formation, said the lack of federal\ncooperation has hindered the nation's effort to stop the flow of\nillegal drugs. The illicit narcotics trade causes 52,000 U.S.\ndeaths per year and imposes $110 billion in annual social and\nhealth-care costs, the Clinton administration reported.\n\n   The task force, the Counterdrug Intelligence Coordinating Group,\nwill meet regularly to share top-secret information and develop\nstrategies to stop the flow of illegal drugs both into and within\nthe United States, said McCaffrey, who directs the Office of\nNational Drug Control Policy.\n\n   The data will be shared with state and local law-enforcement\nagencies, which McCaffrey said are on the front lines in the battle\nagainst drugs. But the data will first be distilled to ensure that\nconfidential information on the sources and methods of gaining the\ndata are not disclosed, he said.\n\n   The federal agencies in the task force will be the departments\nof Justice, Treasury, Transportation and State; the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation; the U.S. Customs Service; the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration; the Internal Revenue Service; the Coast Guard; the\nNational Security Council; and the Office of National Drug Control\nPolicy.\n\n   These agencies each perform vital functions in the drug war, but\ntheir duties have been carried out largely independent of each\nother, said McCaffrey. The task force will end this independence by\nplacing heightened emphasis on combining information and\nformulating joint strategies, McCaffrey said.\n\n   For example, the DEA, which investigates people who deal drugs,\nwill now share data with the Treasury Department, which\ninvestigates narcotics traffickers who try to hide their ill-gotten\nmoney.\n\n   McCaffrey, referred to as the nation's so-called drug czar,\ncalled it unconscionable that federal, state and local law\nenforcement lack a shared database on drug seizures. Combining\ntheir information will permit drug-enforcement agents to have\nbetter knowledge of who, when and where drugs are entering the\nUnited States, he said.\n\n   The creation of the counterdrug task force is the latest in a\nseries of similar initiatives McCaffrey has taken in recent months.\n\n   In September, he and the Treasury Department released a federal\nstrategy to combat money ``laundering,'' the illegal practice\nwhereby drug dealers attempt to conceal their gains from police by\nplacing their money in legitimate businesses, such as banks.\n\n   In December, McCaffrey joined local law-enforcement officials in\nreporting that the federal government would increase its assistance\nto 31 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas nationwide.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY XXXX   \n$$$\n","Headline":"\nU.S. CREATES FEDERAL TASK FORCE TO TACKLE WAR ON DRUGS \n\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ A lack of federal teamwork in the war on drugs\nspurred the Clinton administration Monday to create a task force to\nensure cooperation among U.S. anti-drug agencies.\n","\n   In a report calling for interagency cooperation, the Clinton\nadministration said U.S. departments, unaware of what each was\ndoing to fight drugs, have needlessly duplicated efforts and shown\nmutual ``mistrust and confusion.''
