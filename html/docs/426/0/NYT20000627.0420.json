By JO THOMAS   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   URBANA, Ill. _ Andrew Chambers has the easy manner of a friend\nyou can trust. Federal agents trusted him, and so did drug dealers.\nOver a 16-year career as an undercover informer, Chambers helped\nsend 445 drug dealers to prison.\n\n   Now, in a reversal of fortune, the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration has suspended Chambers and is re-examining the 295\ncases in which he was involved. For reasons that are not clear,\nChambers, who is one of the agency's top informers, has been caught\nlying on the witness stand.\n\n   ``Our investigation shows he has lied 17 times about his\npersonal history,'' said Michael McManus, a public information\nofficer for the agency. ``DEA is concerned about any lies, but\nthere is no evidence he has ever lied about the facts of a case.\nThere are lies about his college education, payment of taxes to the\nIRS and his arrest records. It appears his motivation was that he\nwas embarrassed.''\n\n   H. Dean Steward, a former federal public defender in California\nwho has spent three years trying to get information about Chambers\non behalf of a client, Daniel Bennett, who pleaded guilty in a\nmurder-for-hire case, said he was outraged about Chamber's lying.\n\n   ``There are no such things as little lies in federal court,''\nsaid Steward, who has sued the agency in federal court in\nWashington, to get information on Chambers. ``DEA has put this guy\non the stand many times, knowing he was a perjurer.''\n\n   ``I took him down,'' Steward said.\n\n   Chambers sees things differently, saying the arrests were minor.\n\n   He admits he should have told the complete truth about himself,\nbut he insists he has always told the truth about drug dealers. He\nsaid he doubted that the new turn of events would affect many\ncases, saying, ``Ninety-five percent of my cases pleaded out.'' He\nsaid he had not helped send an innocent man to jail.\n\n   While out of action, he has gone on something of a public\nrelations campaign, granting interviews and planning a book and a\nmovie. But his heart is on the street. ``I'd go back to work\ntomorrow if I could,'' he said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Chambers is 43, and as he arrived for dinner at a local\nrestaurant, the only thing exceptional about his appearance were\nhis fingernails, which were manicured and very, very long.\n\n   ``They're real,'' he said, holding them up to the light. ``I\ndon't look like no cop. I look like somebody that could be a\nplayer. I'm not working, I don't have no 8 to 5, but I'm doing\nsomething.''\n\n   In the years since he first walked into the drug enforcement\noffice in Clayton, Mo., to inquire about becoming an agent,\nChambers has been a player, on the government's side. He did not\nhave the college degree required to be an agent, so he became an\ninformer.\n\n   He was valued, several agency officials said, because he had a\nclean record, did not drink, smoke or use drugs, and always tried\nto keep himself, the agents and the drug dealers safe. In 16 years,\nhe said, no one ever pulled a gun on him or robbed him.\n\n   McManus said that the agency had some 4,500 informers. Some,\nlike Chambers, are mercenaries and are hired by the job. Others\nhave jobs, ranging from baggage handlers to taxi drivers, who serve\nthe agency as eyes and ears on the street. Many are criminals\nseeking reductions in sentences.\n\n   He had attended parochial schools, was an altar boy and a Cub\nScout, and played sports.\n\n   But he dropped out of high school after two years and joined the\nMarines. Three years later, he returned home to try college but\nlasted one semester. Then he decided on a career in law enforcement\nand chose the DEA because he would not have to wear a uniform.\n\n   Jeff McCaskill, a retired drug enforcement agent, worked with\nChambers in 1987 on a Long Beach, Calif., case that he said\ninvolved ``the first and largest crack cocaine organization taken\ndown in the United States.''\n\n   That case began when Chambers met Cecil Fuller, the owner of a\nLong Beach nightclub, on a flight from Los Angeles to St. Louis,\nwhere Fuller was attending a family reunion. Chambers ingratiated\nhimself with Fuller and set up a sting operation. Everyone in the\norganization ended up in prison.\n\n   Over the years, Chambers has worked for other federal law\nenforcement agencies, including the FBI and the IRS, and for police\nin many major cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver,\nHouston, New Orleans, New York and Newark, N.J.\n\n   In all, Chambers has been paid some $2.2 million, including\n$300,000 for expenses. He now concedes that he mismanaged his money\nand neglected to pay federal income tax, which he now owes $64,000.\n\n   His credibility problems began with a 1996 case involving Edward\nStanley, a Los Angeles restaurant owner. Chambers had given federal\nagents Stanley's cell phone number, and on the resulting wiretap\nthey overhead Stanley hiring Bennett as a hit man.\n\n   In an effort to overturn his client's plea-bargained murder\nconviction, Steward challenged the search warrant for the wiretap.\n\n   Steward learned that Chambers had lied on the stand in earlier\ncases, saying he had never been arrested. In fact, he had been\narrested 10 times from 1984 to 1998, with one conviction.\n\n   Chambers was twice arrested for soliciting sex and pleaded\nguilty in one case, in Denver, to a misdemeanor and paid a fine. He\nnow says he had hoped that the prostitute, actually an undercover\npolicewoman, would help him find a drug dealer.\n\n   McManus, the DEA public information officer, said senior agency\nmanagement learned of Chambers' problems in August 1999, and put\nhim on restricted use.\n\n   In January, Chambers' hometown newspaper in St. Louis, The\nPost-Dispatch, published a front page article proclaiming, ``Top\nU.S. Drug Snitch Is a Legend and a Liar,'' and in February, the\nagency suspended Chambers.
