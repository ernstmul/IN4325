Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ As sympathetic victims, common urban pigeons _ even\nthose murdered by the elusive poison-wielding serial killer who has\nbeen stalking them in Manhattan for the past two years _ are a\ntough sell.\n\n   Mark MacDonald, a detective for the American Society for the\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals who has become the guardian angel\nof all living local pigeons and an avenging angel for the deceased,\naccepts that the 8 million or so pigeons that use New York as their\npersonal coop-and-poop receptacle will never be mistaken for man's\nbest friend.\n\n   The ancient Egyptians and Romans found pigeons most useful when\ncooked; Venice recently dealt with its pigeon overpopulation\nproblem by gassing 20,000 birds. In New York, exterminators can use\navitrol, a legal poison, to eliminate nuisance birds who befoul the\nterraces, windows and canopies of the city's luxury abodes.\nMacDonald bemoans but accepts that, too.\n\n   ``For every 50 pigeons killed today, there's 50 more born\ntomorrow,'' he says. But propagation isn't the point. What\nMacDonald doesn't accept is mean-spirited murder, especially murder\nwith a domino effect that has also killed hawks, peregrines,\nsparrows, bluejays and a pair of Central Park mallards: ``This Mr.\nEvil is never going to make pigeons an endangered species,''\nasserts the gray-muzzled MacDonald, who slicks his hair back Eddie\nMunster-style and whose investigative mode is equal parts DeNiro,\nColumbo and Dumbo (he says it helps to play dumb when you're about\nto confiscate an illegal or battered pet or to collar the\nringleaders and patrons at pit-bull and cock fights).\n\n   Against the pigeon killer, though, MacDonald is trying to play\nit smart. He has to: ``He's going to make my life miserable until\nhe makes a mistake and we catch him, and God forbid the poison does\ntrickle down to a child or a domestic pet before we get him.''\n\n   With or without public sympathy, but with the support of\n``National Geographic Explorer,'' which ran a special about his\nefforts last Sunday on CNBC (it will be rebroadcast on Saturday),\nMacDonald is staying his course. There's a killer on the loose, and\nhe intends to find him, cuff him and charge him with animal\ncruelty, now a felony that commands a four-year jail term and\n$2,500 fine.\n\n   It's an unsolved metropolitan mystery where the trail has turned\ncold after more than a thousand deaths. The detective has\nnightmares about the elusive bird-hater who continues to toss an\nillegal and terribly toxic poison, carbofuran, into city streets\nand parks where pigeons congregate. Accustomed to achieving closure\nin his cases, MacDonald has become obsessed by his inability to do\nso with this one, now in its third year.\n\n   ``It's one of the very few cases in my career where I've done\nwhat I swore I wouldn't do: Take the case home with me,'' he says\nwhile rough-housing with Richie, a canine resident awaiting\nadoption at the ASPCA's East 92nd Street headquarters. ``When I get\ninto the car, when I get home, when I'm with my kids, it's there. I\nmay be out on the lake fishing,'' says the detective, who practices\nthe catch-and-release method, ``but my brain is back on Fifth\nAvenue, trying to figure out if there's some little detail I\nmissed.''\n\n   From the start, the case of the pigeon perp was assigned to\nMacDonald, an investigator for Humane Law Enforcement, a\npistol-wielding 13-person team that each year handles 4,500\ncomplaints and makes 200 arrests.\n\n   MacDonald, a 27-year veteran of the ASPCA, where he started out\ncleaning kennels at 18 (and met his wife, who worked there 14\nyears), has a generous respect for all animals. Who else would feel\ncomfortable sharing office space with an impressively fanged\nquartet of tarantulas (the biggest one is named Conan), a pair of\nhissing cockroaches (one of his three children christened them Jack\nand Jill), and a nasty-looking electric eel (call it Anonymous)\nthat packs an 1,100-volt charge.
