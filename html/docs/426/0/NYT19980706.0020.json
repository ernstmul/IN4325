Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 6:\n\n   As more and more Americans communicate and do business\nelectronically, the fear is spreading that information they\ntransmit can be seized by hackers or criminals and used for illegal\nor unsavory purposes. Fortunately, the technology to thwart such\ninvasions already exists. It is called encryption, or the encoding\nof digital information to secure its privacy. But the Federal\nBureau of Investigation is trying hard to prevent the growing use\nof encryption, both in the United States and abroad, because of\nfears that the protective technology itself will get into the wrong\nhands. That shortsighted stand will not only undermine efforts to\nprotect commercial transactions but may also hamper law enforcement\nrather than help it.\n\n   The Clinton administration's current policies toward encryption\nhave been largely dictated by the FBI and the Justice Department.\nThese two agencies now block encryption makers from exporting their\nmost advanced technology unless they agree to develop a method\nallowing law-enforcement agencies to gain access to it. The method\nfavored by the FBI is known as the key escrow, in which the key to\ncracking a code is kept with a third party that could hand it over\nquickly if law-enforcement agencies demanded it.\n\n   But the key escrow method itself poses tremendous threats to\nprivacy. There is a danger that access to keys for the code could\nbe abused by law-enforcement agencies and others. Worse, the United\nStates would be required to share key escrow information with\nlaw-enforcement agencies of other countries, and giving access to\nprivate communications to countries with poor human rights records\ncould lead to crackdowns on dissidents using encryption for their\nown communications.\n\n   According to industry officials, the export controls are already\nbackfiring. More and more foreign companies are supplying\nencryption technologies without key escrow arrangements, making it\nvirtually impossible for the FBI to eavesdrop and stealing business\nfrom U.S. firms. The growing foreign role diminishes the ability of\nthe FBI to demand new safeguards or ways to penetrate the\ncommunications of criminals who use encryption.\n\n   President Clinton might normally be more sympathetic to concerns\nover maintaining privacy in the digital world. But since Attorney\nGeneral Janet Reno has protected Clinton from an independent\ncounsel on campaign finance, the White House is said to be loath to\noppose either her or Louis Freeh, the FBI director, on this issue.\n\n   On Capitol Hill, the debate over encryption has created some\nunusual political alliances. Many conservative Republicans have\nstood with leaders of the high-tech industry to oppose any kind of\nban on encryption within the United States and to support a\nloosening of export controls on encryption technology. It has been\nodd to see Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Dick Armey,\nthe House majority leader, stand with civil libertarians against\nthe demands of the FBI. But the FBI is not without influence. House\nSpeaker Newt Gingrich, more friendly to the agency, has prevented a\nbill encouraging greater use of encryption from coming to a vote in\nthe House.\n\n   The concerns of law-enforcement agencies are legitimate. But\nsmart criminals are already using encryption, some of which is\nreadily available on the Internet. That was the message conveyed\nonly a few weeks ago by such unlikely allies as Bill Gates of\nMicrosoft and Jim Barksdale of Netscape, who are on opposite sides\nin the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft but\nagree on this issue.\n\n   The FBI should give up its losing fight against encryption and\nwork with industry to develop new means to catch criminals who use\nit. One approach under discussion would be to develop software\ntechnology that could be surreptitiously placed in a suspect's\ncomputer to capture keystrokes before they are encrypted. Any such\noperation would have to be carried out under strict court control\nas the electronic equivalent of a search warrant.
