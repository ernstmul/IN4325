He hopes to do that\nby helping people make better choices when selecting a pet. A lot\nof psychology and a little common sense can make a difference, he\ncounsels.\n\n   In his new book, ``Why We Love the Dogs We Do: How to Find the\nDog That Matches Your Personality'' (Free Press, $24), Coren spells\nout why 40 percent of all dogs that are adopted each year end up at\nthe pound, abandoned or dead. He blames psychological\nincompatibility for most mismatches, and he advocates picking dogs\nbased on personality traits _ yours and the animal's.\n\n   It's not brain surgery: If you're laid back, you don't want a\nhigh-strung dog, he says. And you don't want a friendly dog like a\ngolden retriever unless you're sure you'll have the time and\npatience to love it and enough space for it to romp.\n\n   Coren's recommendations differ from others who give advice on\nselecting dogs in that he stresses the importance of analyzing your\nown behavior, not just the reputed personality or physical traits\nof the animal.\n\n   His last book, ``The Intelligence of Dogs'' (Bantam, $13.95),\nmade dog lovers howl by rating 133 breeds from dumbest to smartest.\nThe new book is likely to be less controversial, though it is sure\nto raise the hackles of breeders who disagree with his assessment\nof their dogs' personalities.\n\n   ``I call it like I see it, and we put them where we thought they\nshould be,'' he sniffs.\n\n   Coren wrote his latest book out of disgust at what happens to\ndogs that are abandoned or traded in for a new model. It upsets\nthem, can make them neurotic and, in some cases, might cause them\nto die of a broken heart, Coren says. Thousands are turned in at\nshelters that try to find owners, but are forced to put dogs that\nare not adopted to sleep.\n\n   Separation also can be traumatic for dog owners. They often feel\nlike failures or just plain dumb and may shy away from giving pets\nanother try.\n\n   A University of British Columbia professor who judges dog\ncompetitions and shows his own dogs, Coren used scientific methods\nto come up with the tests outlined in his book.\n\n   After studying the personalities of 6,149 dog owners, scores of\nbreeds and thousands of dogs, he devised simple psychological tests\nfor people in four areas _ extroversion, dominance, trust and\nwarmth. Based on the answers to those tests, the book recommends a\nbreed category. Once you choose a group, any of a dozen or more\ndogs in that listing will do.\n\n   Coren came up with those groups _ friendly, protective,\nindependent, self-assured, consistent, steady and clever _ after 96\nveterinarians, breeders and psychologists rated 22 dimensions of\ndog behavior.\n\n   They didn't test mutts, which can be just as smart and sweet as\npurebreds, Coren says. But the tests can help pick mixed breeds,\ntoo _ just choose one that looks most like one of the dogs that\nbest fit your personality.\n\n   ``If the tests say you'd fit well with a poodle and you see a\nlitter of pups that are part poodle, pick the poodliest one in the\nbunch,'' he says. ``Even mutts behave predictably if you can tell\nwhat kind of dog they look like.''\n\n   Coren's book is the most recent to offer tips on selecting a\ncanine companion, but there are many other places to get advice,\nfrom the Internet to animal shelters. Most any veterinarian can\nhelp you pick a dog, based on factors such as your age, the size of\nyour home and how often you're away, says Bill Garrett, head of the\nAtlanta Humane Society. He avoids recommending specific dogs\nbecause the personalities of canines can vary widely.\n\n   The American Kennel Club simply urges people to educate\nthemselves. This year, the AKC recalled the latest edition of its\n``Complete Dog Book'' and apologized after complaints over its\nclassification of some popular breeds, including rottweilers and\nDalmatians, as not being good with kids.\n\n   Dr. Sharon Crowell-Davis of the University of Georgia, one of\nonly 16 certified dog psychiatrists in the country, also suggests\npeople should do more homework before obtaining dogs, such as\nasking veterinarians and friends for advice and observing the\nbehavior of the parents of potential adoptees.\n\n   After a couple of disastrous experiences with pets, Allen Bower\ndid some homework before buying a bichon frise.\n\n   ``She's playful. She's laid-back. She's always glad to see you,\nand she's not high-strung like a cocker spaniel we had once,''\nBower says. ``She's a perfect match.''\n\n   Getchel Caldwell did the same, talking to breeders and reading\nanything he could find on Chinese shar-peis before shelling out\n$1,800 for a pup.\n\n   ``I always liked the way they looked, but I had no idea of their\ntraits,'' he says. ``He's strong-willed but very personable. We\nhave a soothing relationship. He's a great companion, like the\npeople I talked to said he'd be.''\n\n   Coren stresses the importance of adopting dogs ``not for what\nthey'll do for your ego or image, but for your peace of mind.''\nHe's particularly critical of celebrities who he believes buy dogs\nto fit their public image.\n\n   Mike Tyson's bull mastiff, a mean, aggressive breed that could\nbite the ear off any rottweiler, may well be a good match for him,\nCoren says. Evander Holyfield's Akitas _ which, like bull mastiffs,\nare in the ``protective'' breed group _ jibe with his image as a\nmuscle-bound fighter, but not with his Mr. Nice Guy persona.\n\n   But people who can't afford the full-time trainers that tend\ncelebrities' pets shouldn't buy dogs for image. A golden retriever,\nwhich Coren places in the ``friendly'' category, will go bonkers if\nit's not petted and loved enough. And no amount of hounding or\nscolding can make a dog like a golden retriever crave solitude or\nindependence, Coren adds.\n\n   Other advice: Don't buy a ``fad'' dog unless it fits like your\npersonality. For example, Jack Russell terriers, hot dogs because\nof their exposure on the popular TV series ``Frasier,'' are too\ntemperamental for most folks, Coren says.\n\n   Max Falls, who owns a furniture repair business, wanted an\neven-tempered dog to work with his horses. So he bought an\nAustralian cattle dog, which Coren classifies as clever.\n\n   ``He's well mannered. Very smart. He works real well with my\nhorses, and he's got a lot of spunk. And like my rat terrier, he's\nfeisty,'' Falls says, chuckling. ``I guess that makes us good\nbuddies, 'cause I can be feisty, too.\n\n   Bill Hendrick writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ It's midmorning on a shaded nature trail that tracks\nthe Chattahoochee River, and the scene is funny enough to make a\ndog laugh.\n","\n   Tiny women in skin-tight togs lurch and stumble, jerked along at\nfull gallop by huge, hard-charging dogs on long pastel leashes.\nTall men slow to a trot to keep from outpacing panting, sad-eyed\nminiature schnauzers.\n","\n   Such places can be great laboratories to examine the love people\nhave for their pets _ and also man's inhumanity to dog, says\nStanley Coren, a psychologist and canine authority whose avowed\nmission is to slash the human-dog divorce rate.
