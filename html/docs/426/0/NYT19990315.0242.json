Today these words all too often ring\nhollow as the federal government, the states, counties and cities\nacross the land avail themselves of the opportunity to sequester\nprivate property _ cash, houses, boats _ under laws enacted by the\nCongress in the 1980s as a way to combat the power of major drug\nlords.\n\n   It seemed a good idea at the time to deny the chieftains of the\ndrug trade the weaponry of their ill-gotten wealth to keep them out\nof the laws' clutches.

The net of forfeiture has ensnared a lot more people than\nthe intended mobster drug kingpins.\n\n   According to a report by the Omaha, Neb., World Herald, a\nCalifornian's 200-acre scenic estate in Malibu was raided in 1992\nby the police on the theory that he was growing marijuana.\n``Brandishing a gun to stave off what he thought were criminal\nintruders,'' the owner was shot to death.
