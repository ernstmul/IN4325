The 5- to 9-year-old male age group had the\nhighest rate, 60.7 emergency-department visits per 10,000 persons.\nThe estimated 57,580 dog bite-related visits for boys aged 5 to 9\nyears represent 3.6 percent of all injury-related\nemergency-department visits in this age and sex group.\n\n   Among the cases in which body part area could be determined\n(about two thirds of the cases), the face, neck and head (combined)\nwere the leading body-part sites affected (29 percent), followed by\nthe upper limbs and lower limbs. Among children aged 0 to 9 years,\n73 percent of the injuries with attributed injury site were to the\nface, head and neck, while all other ages had only 30 percent of\nthe injuries occur to the head, face and neck. There was a\nnonsignificant trend toward a seasonal distribution of the\nincidence of dog bite injuries, with the highest rates being\nobserved during the summer months.\n\n   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The researchers urged further study of\nhigh-risk dogs to prevent attacks. But when the American Kennel\nClub suggested in a revision of its ``Complete Dog Book'' this\nspring that certain dog breeds were unsafe for children, it ran\ninto a host of objections and had to withdraw the edition.
