(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By MATTHEW BRELIS  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   BOSTON -- Puppies chew and dogs love to dig and scratch and claw\n_ any owner will tell you that.\n\n   Rarely, however, is their behavior destructive enough to affect\nthe operation of a Boeing 767 airplane. But that's what happened on\nboard United Airlines Flight 174, flying to Boston from San\nFrancisco on July 24.\n\n   An Irish Wolfhound _ the world's tallest dog which was bred to\nhunt wolves, but is known as the ``gentle giant'' _ was in its\nkennel in the cargo hold of the airplane when it somehow got loose.\n\n   ``When that happens, the first thing they want to do is get out\nof the airplane,'' said an aviation source familiar with the\nincident. So, the dog began to dig and chew through the fiberglass\nliner of the cargo pit, that resembles the plastic cabin interior.\nThe canine then went through the soft insulation and then came upon\nwire bundles, which he attacked.\n\n   The case of the dog biting a plane did not cause the pilot to\ndeclare an emergency, although sources said the damage to wires\nresulted in the loss of ``a couple of warning lights in the\ncockpit'' and the pilot could not fully extend the plane's wing\nflaps on landing. The flaps add lift to the plane as it slows to\nland, so the airplane, with 159 passengers and a crew of nine on\nboard, landed at a faster speed than normal, although still well\nwithin the design specifications of the airplane.\n\n   Aviation sources in Boston and Washington say dogs have damaged\nairplanes before, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it\ncould find no record of service difficulties on an airplane being\ncaused by a dog.\n\n   Each year, some 500,000 pets travel on commercial airplanes and\nnearly all of them have happy endings. When something goes wrong,\nthe animal usually suffers the consequences, not the airplane.\n\n   The condition of airplane wiring has gained the attention of\nsafety investigators and aerospace engineers in the wake of two\nrecent crashes. TWA Flight 800 exploded three years ago, killing\neveryone on board, and investigators believe vapors in the center\nfuel tank were ignited _ possibly by faulty wiring. And Swissair\nFlight 111 went down off Nova Scotia a year ago because of an\non-board fire, possibly caused by faulty wiring. But it is aging,\nchafing, and vibrations that are considered prime threats to the\nintegrity of wire. Not dogs.\n\n   ``We are still investigating the circumstances of how an Irish\nWolfhound escaped into the hold of the aircraft,'' said United\nspokeswoman Susana Leyva. ``While we are concerned about the\nincident and were inconvenienced, the crew acted promptly when\ninstruments indicated a possible problem. There was no emergency\ndeclared, none was needed, and the plane landed safely.''\n\n   The flight landed around midnight. Mechanics worked to repair\nthe damaged wiring, and the aircraft was back in service the next\nmorning, Leyva said.\n\n   When baggage handlers opened the cargo door ``there he was, just\nwagging his tail, happy to see to them,'' said the source.\n\n   That the dog could get out of a kennel, and try to bite or claw\nits way out of the cargo hold ``gives you some idea of the sort of\npanic the animal felt,'' says Nancy Blaney, director of the\nnational legislative office of the American Society for the\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\n   The Air Transport Association, the trade association and\nlobbying group for the nation's major airlines, says that in less\nthan 1 percent of the cases is something amiss.
