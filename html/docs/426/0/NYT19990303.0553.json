Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The dog war rages on, and the stories from the front\nline are not pretty. This week an elegant woman who lives on\nRiverside Drive arrived half an hour late for a dinner party and\nexplained her tardiness in two words: ``Dog patrol.'' She grimly\ndisplayed her hands.\n\n   ``Look,'' she said. ``I'm still shaking.''\n\n   She told of walking her Labrador retriever _ on a leash, as\nrequired by law _along the promenade in Riverside Park near West\n86th Street. Suddenly a dog-patrol vehicle appeared, and a menacing\nvoice emanated from the window on the driver's side.\n\n   ``Approach the truck,'' the voice commanded, and she knew enough\nabout the dog patrol not to resist. She approached. When she got to\nthe truck, the driver grudgingly conceded a mistake _ ``I couldn't\nsee your leash'' _ but then detected another violation: her leash\nexceeded the legal limit of six feet.\n\n   ``He let me off this time,'' she said. ``I couldn't believe it _\ndog owners have become public enemies. Approach the truck!''\n\n   She shuddered at the memory. ``You know, I'm beginning to\nunderstand how Jews felt in Nazi Germany.'' Her companions, in\ndeference to her trembling hands, refrained from pointing out that,\nyou know, it wasn't quite the same thing.\n\n   Reasoning with either side in this war is becoming difficult. On\nWednesday, the anti-dog partisans cheered on the patrol divisions\nof trucks and horses as they swept across Riverside Park, trapping\ndog walkers in a ruthless pincers movement. The dog freedom\nfighters were busy posting manifestoes on fences denouncing the\nParks Department. As they watched the horseback patrols go by, they\nalso bitterly wondered why the rangers weren't wielding\npooper-scoopers for their animals.\n\n   Still, peace may not be an impossible dream. With a couple of\nsimple steps, the city might be able to address everyone's\ngrievances, leaving New York with freer dogs, happier humans and\ngreener parks.\n\n   The first step would be to give the Parks Department and the\npublic a new incentive to appreciate dogs. As things stand,\nofficials understandably see dogs as a nuisance, because the\nanimals damage landscapes that have been expensively restored and\ngroomed. And the majority of New Yorkers who don't have pets\nunderstandably resent the idea of surrendering parkland to the\nminority of dog owners.\n\n   But what if dogs started paying their own way? What if the city\ncharged owners an annual park-usage fee of, say, $50 per dog?\nAssuming that there are 750,000 dogs in New York City (estimates\ntypically range from 500,000 to 1 million), the fees would total\nnearly $40 million a year, which is roughly a quarter of the entire\nannual operating budget of the Parks Department.\n\n   Officials would suddenly begin seeing dogs not as pests but as\nprofit centers. The money, besides paying for damage caused by dogs\nand for the maintenance of enclosed dog runs, could also finance\nimprovements benefiting all park users.\n\n   There's already a mechanism for collecting this money, because\ndog owners are required to spend about $10 apiece on dog licenses,\nalthough most don't bother. If the city enforced the requirement\nand raised the fee, the extra money could all go to the Parks\nDepartment, with the revenue from each license specifically\ndesignated for the park near the dog's home.\n\n   The second step would be to relax the leash law for certain dogs\nin certain areas of the parks. The dogs would have to wear a\nspecial tag, which would be available only to well-behaved dogs. To\nqualify for the freedom tag, an owner might have to buy liability\ninsurance and certify that the dog is well behaved (perhaps by\nhaving the dog pass the ``canine good citizen test'' developed by\nthe American Kennel Club).\n\n   Could these measures bring peace? A leader of the dog freedom\nfighters was optimistic. ``The ideas sound OK to me,'' said Jeffrey\nZahn, an Upper West Sider who is president of a group of dog owners\ncalled Floral. ``Some people might complain about paying the fee,\nbut we all know that having a pet costs something. I think the vast\nmajority of owners would support it if it was going to the parks.''\n\n   The supreme commander of the dog patrol, though, was politely\nnoncommittal. ``They're interesting proposals,'' said the parks\ncommissioner, Henry J. Stern. ``We could certainly use the money,\nbut Mayor Giuliani doesn't believe in new taxes.'' So for now, at\nleast, shuttle diplomacy has failed. Somewhere in Riverside Park,\nhands are still trembling.\n","Headline":"\nA PEACE PLAN TO CALM BARKS AND SHOUTS \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ The dog war rages on, and the stories from the front\nline are not pretty.
