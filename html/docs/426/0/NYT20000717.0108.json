Cyber\nDialogue Inc., a Manhattan Internet research firm, reported that as\nof last month more than 40 million adults had used the Internet to\nsearch for health information, an increase of 30 percent over last\nyear.\n\n   The problem, said Dr. Donald Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon\nand a trustee of the American Medical Association, is that given\nthe uneven quality of data on the Web, do-it-yourself medical\nresearch does not necessarily make a more informed patient. Nor\ndoes lugging journal articles to a checkup create the ideal\nbeginning for a productive doctor-patient\n\n   ``You can't bring in a telephone book to your doctor and expect\nhim to read it and examine you at the same time,'' Palmisano said.\n``But you can use the Internet to become more knowledgeable about\nyour disease and facilitate a more focused discussion of treatment\noptions.''\n\n   Gleaning the information you need from the seemingly boundless\nWeb is a matter of knowing how and where to find it. The challenge\nis whittling down huge online databases into a manageable quantity\nof relevant information that you can discuss with your doctor.\n\n   First, familiarize yourself with the medical terminology for the\ninformation you are seeking. An online search for ``cancer,'' for\nexample, will result in an unwieldy amount of data. Narrow your\nsearch to ``Stage IIIB breast cancer'' and your search results will\nbe more focused. Also, do not hesitate to ask your doctor to\nrecommend reliable Web sites.\n\n   To locate useful Internet sites on your own, head to a health\ndirectory, ideally one sponsored by the government, an educational\ninstitution or a well-respected medical institution. In contrast to\ngeneral-purpose Internet search engines, like AltaVista, which spew\nout a list of thousands of Web sites in no particular order or\nformat, health directories organize your search results into\ncategories that can be reviewed quickly. While computerized search\nengines sift through thousands of Web sites for a particular term,\nhealth directories do most of the legwork by compiling and\norganizing your search results into a logical format.\n\n   Federal health directories, for example, offer a trove of\nfiltered information and data. A search on the Web site\nHealthfinder (www.healthfinder.gov), for example, which is\nsponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, generates\na manageable list of reliable government and nongovernment\npublications, clearinghouses, databases and Web support groups on\nhundreds of topics.\n\n   You can use Healthfinder to develop a general understanding of a\ndiagnosis and treatment options, but watch out for some of the\nsite's quirks: a search for ``colon cancer,'' for example, yields\nfew results, while ``colorectal cancer'' locates much data.\n\n   For intensive medical research, the directory for the National\nInstitutes of Health (www.nih.gov) provides free access to Medline,\na database of more than nine million references and abstracts.\nAvoid information overload by limiting a Medline search to the last\ntwo to five years, and by narrowing the search topic as much as\npossible.\n\n   But before visiting your doctor with intriguing Medline\nreferences, double-check the relevance of your findings with\nuniversity medical centers and well-known clinics that use the\nlatest technology and treatments. The University of Pennsylvania\nCancer Center's OncoLink (www.oncolink.com) provides easily\nunderstood information on all types of cancers. The Mayo Clinic's\nHealth Oasis (www.mayohealth.org) offers data and guidance on a\nwide range of medical conditions (including cancer), fast-breaking\nhealth news and interactive tools like Ask the Mayo Physician and\nAsk the Dietician.\n\n   Nonprofit organizations can be excellent sources of\ndisease-specific information. A general rule is to consult only\norganizations that are recognizable and respected.\n\n   The American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) and the National\nAlliance of Breast Cancer Organizations (www.nabco.org), for\nexample, offer a wealth of information, a list of questions to ask\nyour doctor and news on evolving cancer treatment protocols from\nthe National Cancer Institute. But not all nonprofit organizations\nare as altruistic: a surprising number of sites are created with a\nspecific bias (say, toward a particular pharmaceutical brand) or\nmarketing agenda _ another reason to stick with well-known names.\n\n   Though the reliability of disease-specific ``listservs,'' or\nInternet mailing lists, is variable, a good list can put you in\ntouch with a network of patients who may provide more information\nabout your problem than your doctor. One source worth checking is\nthe Association of Cancer Online Resources (www.acor.org). Gilles\nFrydman, the husband of a breast cancer survivor, created the site\nseveral years ago when he was helping his wife research the\ndisease. His network of mailing lists has grown to 150.\n\n   Dot.com fever has produced a number of commercial ventures, many\nwith catchy mottos and eye-catching graphics. Most of these\ncommercial sites, however, include the same standard offerings,\nincluding breaking medical news, medical encyclopedias, information\non clinical trials, chat groups and ask-an-expert services to\nprovide answers to your basic health needs.\n\n   Financing for commercial sites generally comes from\nadvertisements, sponsorships and online stores. A growing number of\nsites are offering additional services and products to boost\nrevenues, including insurance-claims processing (linking doctors\nand health insurers) and customized Web sites for doctors,\npharmaceutical companies and health care organizations.\n\n   MedicaLogic/Medscape is one of the most popular of the\ncommercial ventures. Registered users of its site for\nprofessionals, Medscape (www.medscape.com), and its site for the\nlay consumer, CBSHealthWatch (www.cbshealthwatch.com), together\nnumbered 2.2 million at the end of March. The editor in chief for\nboth sites is Dr. George Lundberg, a former editor of the Journal\nof the American Medical Association.\n\n   Medscape.com is a favorite of doctors because of its specialized\nmedical information and next-day conference summaries.\nCBSHealthWatch.com, a joint venture of MedicaLogic/Medscape and CBS\nNews, provides a layperson's account of health issues and an\nassortment of personal-health-management features, like interactive\nhealth diaries and a nutrition calculator.\n\n   Perhaps the greatest challenge in finding health information on\nthe Web is assessing what you get. The Internet remains an\nunregulated medium with little standing in the way of charlatans\noffering misguided information cloaked in scientific jargon.\n\n   But though no Web site is perfect, the best ones share the same\ndistinguishing features. You should be able to easily spot who\nmanages the site and how it is financed. Look for clear\nidentification of the writers and editors; ideally, contributors\nare affiliated with respectable and longstanding academic or\nmedical institutions.\n\n   Online health industry leaders are taking steps to provide\nconsumers with guidelines to evaluate Web sites. One visible effort\nis the Health on the Net Foundation, a Geneva nonprofit\norganization focused on improving the quality of health\ninformation. There is no guarantee that all the material on a site\nwith the HON logo is accurate, but those that display it have\nagreed, in principle, to certain standards of conduct pertaining to\ncredentials, references, confidentiality, financing and advertising\npolicies.\n\n   TIPS FOR SIFTING THROUGH HEALTH SITES\n\n   Here are some tips on making the most out of the health\ninformation sites on the Web.\n\n   PRIVACY: Steer clear of sites that ask for a lot of personal\ninformation. If you need to register to access information, study\nthe site's privacy policy.\n\n   DATES: Health information changes rapidly, particularly in\nfields like cancer and heart disease, in which new research\nfindings abound. Reputable Web sites include a date for each posted\narticle.\n\n   CREDIBILITY: The most clever quack sites are wrapped in cloaks\nof scientific jargon. Look for peer-reviewed, published studies by\nwell-known academic centers or research institutions. Be wary of\npersonal testimonials.\n\n   LINKS: Web sites usually have a policy on how they establish\nlinks to other sites. Don't assume that links from a reputable site\nwill always lead to other reputable sites. If the link is\nunfamiliar, use common sense in evaluating its information.\n\n   SPONSORS: Running a Web site costs money. The source of funds\nshould be stated clearly. The best sites also clearly separate\nadvertisements, sponsorships and online stores from content.\n\n   (Susan Coburn writes a column on health Web sites for the\nGreenwich Time.)\n\n   ---------------------------------------\n   EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Web site at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on LIFEBEAT\nand other features.  \n\n     NONSUBSCRIBERS: To publish a ``separate-buy'' feature article, it\nmust be purchased.
