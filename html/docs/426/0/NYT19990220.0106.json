One minute he's eating a\nbreakfast of garbage with the rest of his stray dog pack. The next\nhe's running for his life with animal control officers hot on his\nheels.\n\n   ``Need a rope. Need a rope,'' Officer Miguel Gonzalez shouts\nfrom deep inside Turbo's hedgerow hiding place.\n\n   Officers Jesse Castillo and Eric Gardner cover Turbo's only\nexit. Castillo drops his lasso over the hole and snares the fleeing\ngray and white mutt with an expert yank.\n\n   ``How ya doin', Turbo?'' Castillo says, soothing the shaking\ndog, a mutt so familiar residents gave him a name.\n\n   Another day, another collar.\n\n   Truth is, the three officers of the L.A. Animal Services Special\nEnforcement Unit _ the city's stray dog police _ could lasso loose\npooches 24 hours a day, seven days a week and barely put a dent in\nthe city's rogue canine population.\n\n   Conservative estimates put Los Angeles' stray dog population\nequal to the population of a small city: roughly 44,000 dogs. They\nare a motley mix of all shapes and sizes _ from pathetic mutts like\nTurbo to vicious pit bulls with bone-crushing bites.\n\n   Phil Martinez saw a pit bull mix shred two cats in the alley\nbehind his Pacoima house. ``I call the city, no one comes,''\nMartinez said. ``I get so angry I want to kill the stinking dog\nmyself.''\n\n   Animal control officers caught the dog, a pit bull mix still\nwearing a harness and frayed rope. No one knew who owned the dog.\n\n   The stray dog problem is so bad the animal control officers\nfocus only on the worst areas: South Central L.A. and the\n   e   ast San Fernando Valley.\n\n   ``There are no slow days,'' said Lt. Tim Goffa, who serves as\nunit leader and manages the East Valley Animal Shelter. ``Right\nnow, it's out of control.''\n\n   L.A. Animal Services General Manager Dan Knapp said the city has\nignored its stray dog problem for two decades, and now it's time to\npay. He is asking the Los Angeles City Council for $262,000 to hire\nan additional seven officers and another supervisor whose sole duty\nwill be to chase stray dogs. The request effectively triples the\nagency's current $131,000 special enforcement budget, but Knapp\nsays it's crucial.  \n\n     ``We are reacting every day with a minimal ability to even\ntouch the problem,'' he said. ``What we've asked for is two teams\nof five Special Enforcement Unit officers. With that, we can begin\nto impact the problem.\n\n   ``We have a public health crisis. We have at least 44,000 dogs\non the streets that are definitely not inoculated against rabies.''\n\n   Bites are another concern.\n\n   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta\nestimate America's 52 million dogs bite an estimated 4.7 million\npeople a year. About 800,000 bites are considered bad enough to\nrequire medical attention.\n\n   Children account for half of all the bites, the CDC reported.\n\n   The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services dismantled\nits dog bite investigation unit in 1995 to save money, so the scope\nof the local problem is unclear. In 1996, the city and county\nreported 878 animal bites -- dogs, cats and wild animals -- to\nstate health officials, but the figure is far too low, authorities\nsay. In the same report, Orange and San Diego counties reported\n5,705 and 4,483 animal bites respectively in the same period.\n\n   Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for the Prevention\nof Cruelty to Animals-Los Angeles, said animal control always takes\na back seat to a long list of other priorities in most municipal\nbudgets.\n\n   ``It's a problem no one has to see until the dogs are running\nthe streets,'' Bernstein said. ``They're the new street gangs _\nhungry, street-fighting dogs.
