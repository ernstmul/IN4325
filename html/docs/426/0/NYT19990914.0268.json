None of the huffing and puffing through flat\nand uphill spots as you do with cross-country skiing.\n\n   Also missing is the loud, banging rattle of a powerful engine\nbelching smoke from a snowmobile. Instead, you hear the yapping and\nbarking of dogs, obviously excited about a romp through the snow in\nthe fresh mountain air.\n\n   Our trip with Silver Mountain Sled Dog Tours validated why dog\nsledding has become so popular. Such businesses now operate out of\nmost major ski resort areas in the Western United States and\nCanada.\n\n   ``Overall, ancillary activities at ski resorts have grown\nimmensely in the last 10 years, and dog sledding is among the most\npopular,'' said Nancy Pfeiffer, a consultant for InterWest\nAdventures, a public relations company in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n   ``No longer do you go to Park City or Jackson Hole or Vail and\nspend five out of six days skiing. There's snowmobiling, snowshoe\nhikes, cross-country skiing, powder cat tours, sleigh rides,\nhot-air ballooning and ice climbing. Nearly every ski resort has a\nsled-dog operation nowadays,'' Pfeiffer said.\n\n   No wonder.\n\n   As soon as you begin your trip, you feel the dogs' energy and\nenthusiasm and get caught up in it _ that and the beauty of the\nfrozen glades and forests of what people in Colorado call simply\n``the high country.''\n\n   ``You really can see diamonds in the snow up here,'' my daughter\nobserved, pointing out the sun glinting on the pure white expanse.\n\n   Quickly, she fell in love with ``Snowy,'' a pure Siberian husky\nwith beautiful eyes and an unusually sweet temperament.\n\n   ``We look for dogs that are agile and athletic, smart and\ntrainable,'' said Gretchen Dubit, 32, who with her husband, Gregg,\noperates Silver Mountain Sled Dog Tours out of Durango. The Dubits\ngot their first sled dog and began mushing about six years ago.\nThis will be the third season they have commercially worked the\ndogs.\n\n   The Dubits keep 21 sled dogs at the Durango Dog Ranch, their\n40-acre spread near Purgatory Ski Resort. Most of their dogs are\nnot purebred; some were adopted from animal shelters. They may not\nhave the credentials to be sled dogs, but they have the heart.\n\n   A sled dog's desire to work is the most important thing. Sled\ndogs must know the commands to go, turn left, turn right and stop,\nand they have to learn to work together. These working dogs also\nare cuddly and sweet, an important characteristic for animals that\nprovide joy rides for strangers all winter.\n\n   ``We train them to be pets first, but when they are hooked up,\nthey know what it means and what they should do. They want to run,\nthey're ready to go. They are as sweet as can be out of the\nharness, but so serious and intent on working in harness, they get\naggressive,'' said Gretchen Dubit, a high-school teacher.\n\n   Gregg Dubit, 35, a high-school teacher until about a year ago,\npatiently talked my eager 12-year-old through a lesson in mushing.\nHe made sure she knew how to use the sled's two brakes and\nemergency anchor before allowing her to take control.\n\n   She learned to say, ``OK, let's go _ Gii!'' rather than\n``mush,'' because the dogs respond to the particular and consistent\ncommands used in training them.\n\n   For tourists, Silver Mountain uses small, classic curved ash\nsleds with six to eight dogs, depending on the number of\npassengers, who nestle up on sleeping bags with faux fur throws\nwrapped around them or stand on the back like real mushers to drive\nthe sled.\n\n   A sledding trip is a big adventure.
