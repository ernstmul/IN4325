But several police associations said having to\nrecord the data would be an unnecessary burden and would contradict\nthe training officers receive to ignore the race of suspects.\n\n   The bill would have required police officials to record the\napparent ethnicity of every motorist they stop, as well as other\ninformation like age, sex, whether they conducted a search and\nwhether a citation was issued.
