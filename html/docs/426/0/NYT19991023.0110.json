(mk) \n By FRANCIS X. CLINES   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio _ Spurred by the deadly rampage at Columbine\nHigh School, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is\nworking with a threat-evaluation company to develop a computer\nprogram to help school administrators spot troubled students who\nmight be near the brink of violence.\n\n   When the national pilot program, known as Mosaic-2000, begins\ntesting at more than 20 schools in December, its technique of\nconfidentially vetting and rating potentially violent students on a\nscale of 1 to 10 will come not a moment too soon for Steve Dackin,\nprincipal of Reynoldsburg High School.\n\n   ``Columbine forever changed things for all of us,'' Dackin said\nof the school in Littleton, Colo., where two students shot 13\npeople to death before killing themselves in April.\n\n   Dackin knocked on wood in his office as he explained that his\nschool, like most in the nation, had been spared gun violence yet\nhad suffered very real waves of post-Columbine panic and concern\nfor safety that must now be dealt with through safeguard programs\nlike Mosaic.\n\n   ``I see this as being a useful tool,'' Dackin said of the\nprogram, which is based on systems now variously employed by Yale\nUniversity and federal courthouses to evaluate the potential for\nviolence of individuals who make threats.\n\n   The Ohio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has\ncriticized the pilot program as a ``technological Band-Aid'' driven\nby profiteering in parental fears. ``We are understandably hesitant\nabout any program designed to classify students or anyone else in\nsociety as potentially dangerous based on supposedly credible data\nfed into a black box,'' said Raymond Vasvari, legislative director\nof the Ohio ACLU.\n\n   But the Ohio attorney general, Betty Montgomery, who favors the\npilot project, noted that school administrators must already\nmaintain confidential files on troubled students who might veer\ntoward violence. Mosaic, she said, will be a wonderful additional\ntool based on a wide range of objective experience. Far from Big\nBrother, she said, Mosaic is nothing more than highly useful\nsoftware _ a ``three-ring notebook'' to help worried school\nofficials delve better into an existing area of responsibility.\n\n   ``It brings together the shared experiences of many experts plus\nan evaluative piece,'' Ms. Montgomery said. ``It says, `Look, we've\ngone back and spoken to X number of people who have committed these\ncrimes, and these are the risk factors we feel are present in their\nlives.' It collects these risk factors based on actual cases and\norganizes them in a way so we can have a consistent approach.''\n\n   Mosaic programs, which are based on carefully worded questions\nabout student behavior based on case histories of people who have\nturned violent, are designed by Gavin de Becker Inc., a private\nsoftware company in California. They are intended to help officials\ndiscern a real threat amid the innocuous, if frightening, outbursts\nthat regularly cause concern. For the last 10 years, the company\nhas tailored risk-assessment programs for special law-enforcement\nconcerns like threats of domestic violence and threats to the\nsafety of members of the Supreme Court and the governors of 11\nstates, according to the company.\n\n   ``I think it's a wonderful tool that has a great deal of\npotential, and I hope it's properly used by the schools,'' said\nAndrew Vita, associate director for field operations of the Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who found the Mosaic approach\nuseful in investigating bombings at abortion clinics.\n\n   ``We are trying to get some of our focus and resources up front\nof violence, in violence prevention, violence avoidance,'' Vita\nsaid. He noted that his bureau was also developing a program with\nthe Department of Education to train school officials to cope with\nanother area of concern underlined at Columbine _ homemade\nexplosives in schools.\n\n   The Mosaic school program promises to provide questions\ncarefully crafted from case histories by 200 experts in law\nenforcement, psychiatry and other areas. A variety of concerns\nbeyond alarming talk or behavior will be included, from the\navailability of guns to a youngster's abuse of dogs and cats.\n\n   The questions allow a range of answers, from a student who has\n``no known gun possession,'' for example, to one who has ``friends\nwith gun access.'' Not all the questions might be effectively\nanswered by administrators who control the software, officials\nconceded. But they said the more that were, the greater the\ncredibility of the rating would be in the hands of principals\nfacing the responsibility of deciding when to step in and call for\nhelp from specialists.\n\n   Dackin, the principal here, said Mosaic's immediate virtue would\nbe in producing detailed documentation of its evaluation of a\ntroubled student so that doubting parents could no longer challenge\nan administrator's judgment as too subjective. But Mosaic, he\nstressed, will at best be a useful instrument, with the school\ncommunity's ultimate safeguard being in making sure that all\nstudent feel fully involved in school.\n\n   ``It's easy to put up metal detectors,'' Dackin said, ``but\nharder to create a system where students feel connected.''\n\n   The program, which is still being formulated, is to be tested\nfrom grades one through 12, with the main focus being in high\nschools. All the sites have not been determined. It will involve\nonly students who give cause for special concern, school and\nlaw-enforcement officials emphasize. ``We certainly wouldn't want\nto develop any kind of tool for labeling students in any way,''\nVita said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   School officials here expressed confidence that the\nconfidentiality of student records required by law would not be\nbreached by Mosaic. They emphasized that the software would not be\nconnected to any central data program.\n\n   ``It sounds OK, so long as you don't wind up labeling kids,''\nsaid Shelly Darby, who works at the Sun Tang Luck restaurant and is\nthe mother of a second-grader here.\n\n   ``There's kind of scary stuff out there,'' Ms. Darby said. ``But\nthere can be a real fine line between a kid out to get attention\nand a really troubled kid.''\n\n   She drew an empathetic nod from Aron Ross, the assistant\nsuperintendent of schools in Reynoldsburg, a city of 35,000 just\neast of Columbus.\n\n   ``A few dramatic, sad incidents have spawned hysteria,'' he\nexplained, describing a nightmarish week of baseless rumors and\ncountless alarms that caused midnight checks on school lockers\nafter the Columbine killings. And through repeated meetings with\nanxious parents, Ross said, the question remains: What else can we\ndo so it doesn't happen here?\n\n   ``School people in my situation must respond to this new reality\ndirectly,'' he said. ``It used to be a platitude, but no longer,\nabout creating an environment where students and teachers are safe\nand feel safe.''\n\n   The de Becker company describes itself as a specialist in\nhigh-stakes assessments.
