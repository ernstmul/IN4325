She smiles sweetly and\nextends her hand, touching Sara's face gently and telling her how\nlovely she looks.\n\n   Seeing Sara brings back memories that, for a moment, make her\nsad, even homesick.\n\n   ``This is the first time in my life I didn't have a dog or\ncat,'' Cox says. ``I had a dog all my life until I come here.''\n\n   Here is the Alzheimer's unit of the Carolina House, a Greenville\nlong-term care facility. Probably the last place you'd expect to\nfind two pit bulls.\n\n   But here they are, lapping up all the attention they're getting.\nSara and Skibo are working the crowd, licking hands and posing for\npictures.\n\n   ``It seems to me there's something about a cat or dog that's\nfamily,'' Cox says. ``If it won't (against policy), I'd sneak one\nin.''\n\n   But Sara and Skibo haven't been smuggled in under somebody's\ncoat. They are guests, invited by Betsy Jones, activities director\nat the facility.\n\n   The Carolina House soon plans to have live-in pets like its\nsister facility in western North Carolina. More nursing homes and\nother facilities are rethinking standard no-pets policies in favor\nof an approach that recognizes the potential benefits of human and\nanimal contact.\n\n   ``Actually, we have more families now who are bringing people's\npets in,'' says Amy Beach, recreation services director at\nGreenville Villa, where one aim of animal visits is to give the\nfacility a more homelike atmosphere.\n\n   ``There's a growing trend in that direction, making it (the\nfacility) as homey as possible,'' says Sandra Triebenbacher, an\nassistant professor in the Department of Child Development and\nFamily Relations at East Carolina University.\n\n   Triebenbacher is one of four people in the state certified to\nevaluate animals through the Pet Partners Program. The program,\nestablished in 1990 by the Delta Society, has established\nguidelines for animals used in therapy and visitation programs.\n\n   Drake Parker, owner and head trainer at Top Dog Academy, has had\nhis American pit bull terriers certified as Pet Partners. Now Sara\nand Skibo can accompany him on visits to schools, nursing homes and\nday care centers.\n\n   The breed, which has been linked with dog fights and other\naggression in the public perception, is not always a welcome sight.\n\n   ``Sometimes I do get looks,'' Parker admits. Because he has not\ncut his dogs' ears or tails, customary for pit bulls, they look\nmore like the beloved pooch of ``The Little Rascals'' than the\nfighting breed often depicted in the news.\n\n   ``The perception is definitely wrong,'' Parker says. ``If you\nsit here and watch my dogs for a little while, you might just\nchange your mind.\n\n   ``It's not so much a breed thing as it is the owner. I've been\naround them (pit bulls) since I was a kid, and I know what the\ntruth is.''\n\n   Stereotypes don't seem to mean much at the Carolina House, where\nnobody seems to care that they're petting pit bulls.\n\n   ``They're beautiful,'' Martha Stang says, admiring Sara and\nSkibo. ``They're the kind of dogs you'd be proud to have.''\n\n   The Delta Society isn't concerned about breeds either. That is\nnot taken into consideration during Pet Partners certification.\n\n   ``One of the most important things that we are taught as we go\nthrough the evaluator process is that we don't even take breeds\ninto consideration,'' Triebenbacher says. ``We look at every single\nindividual animal and their handler.\n\n   ``All of his (Parker's) pit bulls are so laid-back and\neasy-going. Pit bulls, certainly, and rottweilers have had real bad\nraps. Every dog has potential.''\n\n   Even strays and mixed-breeds.\n\n   ``Probably in this country there are more mixed breeds that are\ninvolved in this type of activity,'' Triebenbacher says.\n\n   Triebenbacher's dog, Scruffy, a terrier mix, is a Pet Partner,\nas is Suzie, a border collie. She's working to teach a third, Sam,\na lab-chow mix and a stray, so he can join her on visits to schools\nand nursing homes.\n\n   In schools, the dogs are teaching props.\n\n   ``I went to one preschool classroom, and there was a child who\nhad some challenges with biting,'' Triebenbacher recalls. ``When he\nwould get very angry and frustrated, he would bite. Interestingly\nenough, of all the things about Suzie (her dog), he was most\nintrigued by her teeth. This was a real teachable moment to talk\nabout what we use our teeth for.''\n\n   On a recent visit to preschoolers in the Child Development\nLaboratory at East Carolina University, children asked questions\nabout dogs biting and licking. But mostly, they just wanted to\ntouch them.\n\n   Touching pets and communicating with them has been shown to\nlower blood pressure and increase longevity. Additional studies are\nexploring a connection between contact with animals and decreased\ndepression, isolation and loneliness.\n\n   ``(Sometimes) patients ... have decided they're not going to\ntalk and they're not going to interact with anyone, and all of a\nsudden an animal comes into the room and they say 'puppy,' and they\nhaven't spoken a word in 10 days,'' Triebenbacher says. ``That's an\nexciting thing.''\n\n   Carol King, food service director at Greenville Villa, noticed\nsome pretty remarkable reactions from patients when she started\nbringing her Chihuahua, Lucy, to work.\n\n   ``My husband found (Lucy). She was abandoned,'' King says. ``We\nstarted pet therapy after that. They ask me all the time since I\nwork out here, 'When's Lucy coming back?'\n\n   ``Especially the ones with Alzheimer's disease, they perk up.\nThey definitely want to to touch them and talk to them. Quite a few\nof them have surprised me.''\n\n   King invited her neighbor, Mary Snow Harriss, to bring her dogs\n_ all five of them _ out for visits.\n\n   Greenville Villa resident Lonnie Turner seldom misses the chance\nto see the dogs, especially Tylullah, a poodle.\n\n   ``I love to see them come,'' she says. ``If I don't come, they\ntake them to my room.''\n\n   Gigi Walter brings her two poodles, Oodi and Tevi, out as well.\nTogether, the seven or eight dogs stand on a table in the activity\nroom where residents take turns petting them, holding them and\nfeeding them doggy treats.\n\n   ``I love dogs,'' Walter explains, ``and I like sharing my\npuppies with someone else who has loved dogs all their lives.''\n\n   Harriss says her dogs benefit from the experience as well.\n\n   ``Mine usually come in for the group,'' she says. ``This is the\nhighlight of their whole lives.''\n\n   Besides Tylullah, there's Darby (a Pomeranian), Bridget (a Shih\nTzu), Charlotte (a Pekingese) and Annie (an English Springer\nSpaniel). They range in age from 6 to 12.\n\n   ``All of my dogs needed homes,'' Harriss says. ``These are dogs\npeople didn't want.''\n\n   Greenville Villa residents find that hard to imagine as they\nstroke, brush and hug the dogs Harriss adopted.\n\n   ``There are residents of this nursing home who have pictures of\nmy dog next to pictures of their grandchildren,'' Harriss says.\n``They love them.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ When Sara comes to visit, she's like one of\nthe family.\n","\n   Nannie Lee Cox is happy to see her.
