(af)  \n By JOSEPH BERGER   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Responding to questions about why it took almost six\nmonths to find a rifle that may have been used to kill a Buffalo,\nN.Y.,-area doctor who performed abortions, law enforcement\nofficials defended the thoroughness of their investigation on\nMonday and said metal detectors had been used soon after the\nkilling to scan the area around the doctor's home, though with no\nsuccess.\n\n   ``All agencies are pursuing this case aggressively,'' said Major\nMichael McManus, the troop commander of the New York State Police\nin western New York and one of the few officials willing to comment\non the inquiry into the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian.\n\n   The rifle was found on Thursday buried about a foot below the\nsurface in piney woods roughly 200 feet behind Slepian's residence,\nwhere he was killed by a sniper on Oct. 23. A short statement by\nlaw enforcement officials said that ``weather and ground\nconditions'' in the days after the slaying delayed the kind of\nrefined search that turned up the rifle.\n\n   Friends and neighbors of the family have asked why the rifle was\nnot found sooner, pointing out that last autumn was fairly warm and\ndry and that heavy snowfall did not start until January. Some\nindependent investigators also wondered why the gun had not been\nfound sooner.\n\n   ``If you're looking for a gun, it's one of the easiest things to\nuse a metal detector to find,'' said Michael G. Cherkasky, a former\nprosecutor who is chief operating officer of Kroll Associates, a\nprivate investigative firm.\n\n   Replying to such comments, a federal and a state law enforcement\nofficial, both of whom refused to be identified, said Monday that\nthe grounds behind the doctor's home in Amherst, N.Y., had been\nthoroughly searched in the weeks after the slaying. Some of the\nsearches were conducted by hand, but a metal detector was also\nused, they said. One of the officials said using a detector could\nbe a ``hit or miss'' proposition.\n\n   Officials have not said how the rifle was found, nor have they\ndescribed it other than to say it resembled the weapon that would\nhave fired the caliber of bullet that killed Slepian. It has been\ntaken to Washington for ballistics tests.\n\n   The contention that the authorities were diligent was partly\nbolstered by the account of two of the Slepian family's neighbors,\nSandy Arno and Mary Wilson.\n\n   They recalled that in the days after the slaying, they saw a\nline of at least a dozen investigators working shoulder to\nshoulder, sometimes on their hands and knees, searching the four\nacres of backyards and woods behind the Slepians' house.\n\n   Mrs. Arno and Mrs. Wilson do not recall seeing anyone using a\nmetal detector. ``It struck me as so amazing that they found\nstrands of hair but not a rifle because they seemed to be doing\nsuch a thorough job,'' Mrs. Arno said. ``It seemed extremely\nwell-organized.''\n\n   Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only clinic still performing\nabortions, was shot to death at 10 p.m. as he stood in his kitchen\ntalking with his wife and sons. The sniper hid in a stand of trees\nabout 100 feet behind the house, which is surrounded by a fenced-in\nyard that encloses a swimming pool.\n\n   The rifle found on Thursday, which has not yet been positively\nidentified as the murder weapon, was unearthed 100 feet deeper in\nthe woods near one of several paths the Arnos have carved out for\nwalking dogs and for children to caper. Monday, the water-filled\ntrench created by the digging was marked by mustard-colored spray.\n\n   An expert in metal detectors said they can be unfailingly\naccurate if they are properly adjusted to seek a specific metal.\nSean Rabbani, owner of A&S Co. in Santa Clara, Calif., a large\ndistributor of the devices, said a detector of conventional quality\ncould sense metals as deep as a foot and a half below the surface,\nand some can detect metal as deep as 20 feet.\n\n   The iron or steel in a gun, he said, would require settings for\n``lower discrimination'' than the quarters a beachcomber might look\nfor.\n\n   ``Maybe they didn't know how to use it,'' Rabbani said. ``If I\nwas there I would find it in a couple of acres in eight hours.''\n\n   The police have not yet named a suspect in the slaying, but they\nhave issued a warrant for the arrest of James C. Kopp as a material\nwitness.
