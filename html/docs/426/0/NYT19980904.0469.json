The heroin, worth\nan estimated $46 million on the street, was then trucked to Lubbock\nin West Texas, where the drug ring wanted to test the North\nAmerican market by pushing heroin in Dallas-Fort Worth as well as\nin large Northern cities, authorities said.\n\n   The ring was discovered after a tip from European authorities,\nCoggins said.
