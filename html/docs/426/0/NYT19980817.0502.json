Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said\nit all. Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected\nto, and then he had taken even more.\n\n   Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet. Then came abandonment\non the beaches of Brooklyn. Mercy arrived in the form of a new\nowner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but when he was 8, Al's\nback gave out. Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he\nstill wasn't the dog he used to be.\n\n   His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a\npilgrimage of stubborn hope. There, in a back yard in Murray Hill,\nAl dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water\nthat might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower\nessences had not: heal him.\n\n   With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding\ntight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his\ngimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise\nthey sorely needed.\n\n   His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he\nleft the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn\nchair.\n\n   ``I want him to get well,'' she said, articulating the simple\nwish that had wrought such complicated ministrations. ``I want him\nto have a good life.''\n\n   That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has\nushered in a whole new era in animal care. Ms. Richard's business,\nBonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is\nbut one example.\n\n   Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking\ndogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with\nhomeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets\nbeneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with\nlavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.\n\n   All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture\nblissed out on St. John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil. It is\nalso the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many\nAmericans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances,\nfrom summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of\ntheir families.\n\n   Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal\nMedical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of\ncross-species psychological transference. ``We project our\ncharacter flaws on our pets,'' he said. ``We project our behavior\non them. I've even had clients project their religion on them. This\nis very much in the same fashion.''\n\n   Could your cat benefit from an adjustment? There are a growing\nnumber of veterinary chiropractors on hand. Is there knotting in\nyour dog's muscles? You can take him to a canine massage therapist.\nIf it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not\njust on the most common species.\n\n   Dr. Gerald Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has\nperformed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones. Dr. Marcie\nFallek, who has offices in New York and Fairfield, Conn., has\nadministered homeopathic treatments _ solutions with minuscule\ntraces of special plant or mineral ingredients _ to a pet raccoon\nthat was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and\nhad stopped using its litter box.\n\n   The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities\nwould learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be\ninterviewed for this article, even anonymously, Fallek said. ``Her\npsychic told her there might be trouble,'' Fallek explained.\n``Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know.''\n\n   Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure\nquackery? As it turns out, less than one might think.\n\n   Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary\nMedical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at\nleast on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was\nbeyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably\neffective.\n\n   But Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower\nessences and the like. ``That's really getting on the fringe,'' he\nsaid, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such\ntreatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians\nand their clients. ``The world is made up of a lot of very\nvulnerable and gullible people,'' he cautioned.\n\n   It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes\nto the vim and vigor of their hirsute _ or, for that matter,\nfeathered _ loved ones. According to the association, expenditures\nby Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and\nbirds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied,\nfrom $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for\ninflation). During that period, the pet population grew only\nmodestly.\n\n   The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of\nalternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not\ncheap. In New York City _ where, granted, prices for most things\ntend to be highest _ half an hour of acupuncture generally costs\n$50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing\nwaters costs $75. Because treatments are usually repeated over the\ncourse of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high\nhundreds.\n\n   Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than\njust random experimentation more than two decades ago. Racehorses\nwere the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes\nsurrounding the health of these animals were highest.\n\n   But in the last five years, the field has really taken off,\ndrawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either\nintegrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary\npractices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.\n\n   The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was\nfounded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians. The\nInternational Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974,\nreports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is\nstill a small fraction of all veterinarians.\n\n   Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary\nacupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being\nventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats,\ndogs and parrots.\n\n   ``A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles _ well,\nnot the shell,'' Ms. Watkins said. ``I know a guy in San Diego who\nis doing a dolphin.''\n\n   There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to\nalternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product\ncatalogs, many with their own Internet sites.  \n\n   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS   \n\n   nn\n\n   The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalog provides a\nlink to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses,\nincluding the ``Broodmare Blend,'' the ``Clear Thinking Blend,''\nthe ``Ego Builder Blend'' and the ``Mellow Out Blend.''\n\n   Although pets being given alternative treatments are often\nfollowing their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the\nother way.\n\n   ``I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw\nhow well it worked for Lola,'' Liz Santander, an interior designer\nfrom Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog\nawaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of\nDr. Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.\n\n   It was a busy, busy day. While Lola, who was bouncing back from\na stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame\nshepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.\n\n   A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially\nparalyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan,\nstraps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees.\n(``I have to throw the Frisbee right at him,'' O'Sullivan\nexplained.)\n\n   But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage\ntherapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a\nparticularly intimate, thorough petting.\n\n   ``Feel for the bony landmarks,'' Ms. Cooper instructed\nO'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in\nChinatown. ``Push away from the spine.''\n\n   Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an\nacupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with\nkidney problems. For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn;\nthen another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin\ncushion. Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.\n\n   A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms. Richard's\npatients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy,\ninvisible treadmill. Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with\nDuncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about\n35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for\nrunning.\n\n   Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu\nrecovering from surgery for a ruptured disc. The operation had left\nSydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully\nregain.\n\n   This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked _ as\nfar as these things can be determined _ appalled and terrified\nabout taking the plunge. ``He's a good boy,'' Lauran Walk, his\nowner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the\nsurface. ``He's a good, good boy.''\n\n   Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village,\nsaid that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that\nSydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.\n\n   But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and\nwould do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was\nonly a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.\n\n   ``He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a\nchance,'' Ms. Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a\nshivering knot of fur with limited mobility. ``I can't be\nselfish.''\n","Headline":"\nALTERNATIVE MEDICINE FOR AILING PETS \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said\nit all.
