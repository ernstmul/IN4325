The police had refused to\nrelease the information to the company, citing the California\nPublic Records Act, which limits release of the records to\norganizations with a scholarly, journalistic, political or\ngovernmental purpose.\n\n   A U.S. district court and then the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of\nAppeals ruled for the publishing company. In its decision, the 9th\nCircuit rejected the state's argument that it sought to protect the\nprivacy of arrestees, noting that the information is made available\nto newspapers that can publish the information at will.\n\n   Attorney Thomas Goldstein, pressing the police department's\nappeal, conceded that the controversial law restricts corporate\naccess to the records but added that the restriction is necessary\nto protect the privacy of arrestees. He said companies like United\nReporting indiscriminately sell the information to professional\nservice agencies.\n\n   But Justice Antonin Scalia appeared unswayed, noting that the\nlaw allows newspapers to have unrestricted access to the records.\nNewspapers, just like United Reporting, are in the business of\nselling information, Scalia said.\n\n   Goldstein, of Washington, D.C., responded that the\n``constitutional tradition'' of freedom of the press entitles\nnewspapers to the information. No such constitutional protection\nexists for companies seeking to sell information to solicitors.\n\n   ``There are massive wholesale invasions of privacy'' when\ncompanies like United Reporting sell the information to attorneys\nand social workers, Goldstein said. The data in the arrest records\nis a mere ``commodity'' to United Reporting, he added, drawing a\nstinging rebuke from Justice David H. Souter.\n\n   ``Information is a commodity to the New York Times,'' Souter\nsaid, indicating that no legal difference exists between United\nReporting and newspapers.\n\n   Assistant Solicitor General Edward DuMont, pressing the Clinton\nadministration's support for the California law, conceded that\nnewspapers are free to publish information they get from police and\nother state agencies. But states should remain free to dictate that\nthe information it releases will not be used for commercial gain,\nhe added.\n\n   For example, DuMont said the Los Angeles Times can publish the\nnames and addresses of arrestees, but it cannot use the information\nfor the commercial purpose of soliciting subscribers.\n\n   But Scalia objected, saying the Constitution prohibits states\nfrom providing information to one industry _ newspapers _ while\nkeeping it from others.\n\n   ``Joe Sixpack should be able to do anything with the information\nthat the press can do,'' Scalia said.\n\n   In response, DuMont said United Reporting is just as free as\nnewspapers to publish any information it acquires. However, the\nConstitution does not require that the state help the company\ngather the data.\n\n   United Reporting's attorney, Bruce Ennis, countered that the\nCalifornia law violates the First Amendment by permitting police to\ndiscriminate between speakers, giving information to newspapers but\nnot to other companies. Ennis said the law violates constitutional\nprotections for commercial speech by keeping information from\ncompanies involved in solicitation.\n\n   But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed.\n\n   ``The state is not saying, `We don't like solicitors,''' she\nsaid.
