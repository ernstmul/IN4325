It's a phenomenon that's not only\nan assault on the eyes and feet, but a significant threat to\nrespiratory health, according to Mexico City health officials.\n\n   Unchecked dog feces contributes to Mexico City's notoriously bad\nair, along with automobile emissions, officials say.

More than 600,000 people live in\nthe district and between 4 million and 4.5 million people work,\nshop, eat or simply visit there every day.\n\n   The excrement-extermination program fits into the district's\nplans to reclaim the borough's decaying public areas, Carner said.\n\n   It's also the result of a push for greater ``civic involvement''\nin government, he said, a cornerstone of the 1997 election campaign\nof Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas -- the city's first\ndemocratically elected mayor.\n\n   At least one other district is following Cuauhtemoc's example\nand has signed an agreement with the Pro-Neighbors Movement to also\nstart cracking down on dog waste, said Herrejon.\n\n   At the Santa Maria de la Ribera Park, people on an early morning\nstroll with pets said they're in full support of reducing errant\ndog feces.\n\n   ``I always pick up the poo poo. I can't pick up the pee pee, of\ncourse,'' said an elderly woman walking her Bassett hound.\n\n   Fabiola Perez, mistress of two dogs, pulled out a plastic bag\nfrom her pocket as evidence that she was cooperating.\n\n   ``It's a good program,'' she said. ``We've become way to used to\njust letting our dogs run around and letting them do their thing.''\n\n   Perez said some pet owners continue to ignore the regulations\nand scoff at police -- probably because they don't respect them,\nand associate police with corruption and bribes.\n\n   ``The only real vigilance,'' she said, ``is going to be between\nneighbors.''\n\n   Beyond pets, Perez said, the city and federal health officials\nneed to start better managing the capital's street dogs.\nPeriodically, dogs are rounded up and vaccinated or even\nsterilized, but they're often released back on the streets.\n\n   Two such dogs live in Santa Maria de la Ribera Park. Perez and\nother residents offer the animals affection -- they say they are\ngentle -- and have named them Bones and Buford.
