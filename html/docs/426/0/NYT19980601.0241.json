Carriers are equipped with pepper\nspray to ward off attacking dogs, a fact that helps account for the\nrecent reduction in dog bite victims among letter carriers. In the\nmid-1980s, more than 7,000 carriers suffered dog bites annually.\n\n   During National Dog Bite Prevention Week, post offices around\nthe nation will coordinate with local humane societies and animal\ncare and control officials on public education about avoiding dog\nbites.\n\n   The Postal Service offers this advice on how to avoid a dog\nbite:\n\n   _ Don't run past a dog. Its natural instinct is to chase and\ncatch prey.\n\n   _ If a dog threatens you, don't scream.\n\n   _ Avoid eye contact, try to remain motionless until the dog\nleaves, then back away slowly until the dog is out of sight.\n\n   _ Always let a dog see and sniff you before you pet the animal.\n\n   The Postal Service gives these pointers to ``responsible dog\nowners'':\n\n   _ Don't assume your dog won't bite.\n\n   _ Spay or neuter your dog _ unneutered dogs are three times more\nlikely to bite.\n\n   _ When your letter carrier comes to your home, keep your dog\ninside, away from the door in another room or on a leash.\n\n   _ Don't let your child take mail from the letter carrier in the\npresence of your dog. Your dog's instinct is to protect the family.\n\n   The other top 30 dog-bite cities were:\n\n   The Los Angeles area (29 bites), Cleveland, (25); Dallas (23);\nFort Lauderdale, Fla. (22); Kansas City, Mo. (17); St. Petersburg,\nFla. (17); Phoenix (17); Brooklyn, N.Y. (17); Charlotte, N.C. (17);\nSan Antonio (17); Buffalo, N.Y.
