Times News Service clients)  \n BY DENNIS WAGNER  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Smugglers, apparently spooked by law enforcement agents, stashed\nmarijuana on her border property near Bisbee Junction. Lindstrom\nmulled it over awhile, then hauled the stuff to Phoenix.\n\n   Soon, she was making regular runs, taking drugs north and coming\nhome with cash.\n\n   A dozen years later, Lindstrom, wearing a pink sweatshirt with\n``MOM'' emblazoned across the chest, smiles innocently.\n\n   ``I'd get money, and I'd go skiing with it,'' the Doris Day\nlook-alike says. ``It was only for the extras.''\n\n   For years, Lindstrom's life seemed as scripted as a 1950s movie.\n\n   She grew up in the Valley of the Sun and graduated from Tempe\nHigh School when she was just 16. She attended peace vigils during\nthe Vietnam War but was hardly a hippie. She went to college and\nearned a bachelor's degree in zoology, along with a teaching\ncertificate.\n\n   Then she married a physician, moved to southern Arizona, raised\nkids, volunteered at school.\n\n   Enter Gary Patrick Callahan, a Border Patrol agent and Vietnam\nvet who also defies the narco-profile.\n\n   Lindstrom and Callahan became friends, then romantic partners.\nIn Bisbee Junction, a Mayberry-like town on the edge of Mexico, the\nhomemaker and lawman turned outlaw.\n\n   They got drugs from smugglers and took them to William Bartel,\nLindstrom's brother and a Paradise Valley dentist, who sold the\nstuff.\n\n   During a 1989 raid at Bartel's home, investigators found 81\npounds of cocaine. They arrested a dentist who was willing to avoid\nprison by testifying against his divorced sister and her boyfriend.\n\n   And that's only half the story.\n\n   Eventually, Lindstrom was convicted, married Callahan and served\ntwo years in prison.\n\n   Callahan fled to New Zealand. He was hunted down, returned to\nthe United States and sentenced to 27 years in an Arkansas\npenitentiary, where he whiles away the days filing appeals and\ndoling out legal advice to fellow inmates.\n\n   Callahan also helped found the November Coalition, one of the\nnation's most prominent organizations dedicated to overthrowing the\ndrug war.\n\n   As for Bartel, he never spent a day in prison. He pleaded guilty\nto drug charges and, in return for cooperating, got probation and a\n$5,000 fine. He has resumed practicing dentistry.\n\n   Ivan Abrams, an assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute the\ncase, quit his job and agreed to write a book with Callahan and\nLindstrom. Their theme: America's drug war is an unwinnable,\nhypocritical, expensive police action that violates the U.S.\nConstitution.\n\n   The book deal collapsed after Abrams ran for Cochise County\nattorney and issued campaign fliers touting his prosecution of\nCallahan and Lindstrom. Abrams lost the election. He has a private\npractice now, defending drug offenders and other clients.   \nFIGHTING BACK\n\n   Gary Callahan has plenty to say about the drug war, and plenty\nof time to say it.\n\n   He contends that politicians have played the public for fools,\nusing anti-drug hysteria to win votes.\n\n   The anti-drug campaign, he argues, has systematically squandered\ntax dollars, eroded civil rights, destroyed families and\ntransformed America into the world's biggest gulag.\n\n   His November Organization puts it this way: ``From the very\nonset, the war on drugs was fashioned as a political tool, but it\nhas been hammer-forged in the ensuing years into a weapon that is\nwreaking havoc on our lives.''\n\n   In a 10-page letter written from prison, Callahan elaborated,\n``The drug war is destroying families at a pace that far and away\noutstrips the damage that drugs do. Just go into any prison\nvisiting room on the weekend to see what this war is doing. It is a\nthing unprecedented in American experience.''\n\n   Callahan's cynicism is born of gung-ho idealism. His dad fought\nat Guadalcanal with the U.S. Marine Corps, then became a U.S.\nimmigration officer in charge of the Bahama Islands.\n\n   Callahan followed suit, joining the Marines out of high school\nwhile other young Americans protested the Vietnam War. He learned\nto track the Viet Cong, watched buddies get killed and earned a\ncouple of Purple Hearts.\n\n   ``I wanted to go,'' he explains, ``mistakenly believing that it\nwas a valid cause. . . . I arrived in my company with 13 others.\nSeven were killed. Five were shipped home shot or blown to bits.''\n\n   After the war, Callahan signed up for a new tour of human\nhunting, this time with the Border Patrol. But he grew just as\ndisillusioned chasing poor Latin Americans through the desert as he\nhad chasing the Viet Cong in the jungles of Southeast Asia.\n\n   Callahan says his job was to defend America from illegal\nimmigration, but agency commanders were obsessed with making dope\nseizures for publicity and federal money.\n\n   He mocks those who say the drug war is winnable. Inspectors can\ncheck only a fraction of the vehicles crossing U.S. borders. The\nmass deployment of agents and money is laughable, he says.\n\n   And then there's the insidious corruption . . .   \nDOPE JUSTICE?\n\n   Because of pending appeals, Callahan won't discuss his crimes.\n\n   He was accused of stealing marijuana and cocaine from smugglers\nat the border, then transporting the stuff to Bartel for sale.\n\n   Since his conviction on two charges, Callahan has claimed that\nfederal agents and prosecutors made their case with unlawful\nsearches, perjured testimony and illegal interrogations.\n\n   ``You think you've got rights?'' he says. ``Better think again.\n. . . I would never on Earth receive a fair trial.''\n\n   Callahan claims that is why he skipped bail, fled to New Zealand\nand lived on a sailboat.\n\n   Today, the bitterness is rivaled only by his melancholy over\nbeing banished from three sons.\n\n   ``We had been very close,'' he says. ``I haven't seen them in\nyears because the feds send you as far away from home as they can .\n. . to punish you and destroy the very fiber of your life.''\n\n   Callahan compares drug conspiracy statutes with Soviet\nanti-thought laws. He accuses government prosecutors of routinely\nbribing witnesses with money or coercing them with threats of\nprison.\n\n   He decries the incarceration of non-violent criminals and points\nout that taxpayers spend billions to build prisons for drug\noffenders while public schools fall apart.\n\n   ``The staggering number of families destroyed. . . . Has it\nworked?'' Callahan asks. ``That is the question that most needs an\nhonest answer.''   \nSHE DIDN'T INHALE\n\n   Betty Lindstrom says she tried marijuana in the '60s, ``but I\ndidn't inhale because I didn't want that stuff in my lungs.''\n\n   She grins at the Clintonesque irony, adding, ``I was in college.\nIt was cool. All the other people were doing it. . . . We were just\nplaying at it, same as I was playing at being a drug dealer.''\n\n   Now 52, Lindstrom acknowledges how naive that sounds and how she\nthrew away a life that many would describe as the American ideal.\n\n   She had a successful husband and three healthy kids; she worked\npart-time at   her husband's medical office, directed a school play,\nhelped run a service station.\n\n   Like anyone who lives along the border, Lindstrom occasionally\nsaw people carrying suspicious loads on their backs. She'd report\nthem to drug agents.\n\n   But when she chanced on two bundles of dope in an arroyo, she\ndecided to leave the stuff and see what would happen. Days passed.\nCows ate most of the dope. Lindstrom took the remainder to her\nbrother. Easy money.\n\n   She began watching for other stashes. She was friends with\nseveral Border Patrol agents and listened for scuttlebutt, knowing\nthat drug runners often stash their dope before getting busted or\nrunning back to Mexico.\n\n   ``I would walk my dogs the next morning and look for things they\n(agents) missed,'' she says. ``It was fun. I never thought of the\nconsequences.''\n\n   Over time, Lindstrom says she and Callahan teamed up. They\nweren't drug users or big-time dealers, she insists, just\nopportunists.\n\n   ``I don't think I had a political thought in my head,'' she\nsays. ``That's why I didn't realize that what I was doing was so\nserious. . . . It was a game, a bad game.''   \nUNEQUAL JUSTICE\n\n   When the game ended, Lindstrom and Callahan went to jail.\n\n   Lindstrom is convinced that federal prosecutors were trying to\nmake an example of a drug ring that involved a federal lawman, a\ndentist and a housewife.\n\n   ``They were awful to me,'' she says. ``They wanted to break\nme.''\n\n   She served most of her 2{-year sentence at a Phoenix prison for\nwomen, working yard maintenance for 12 cents an hour.\n\n   ``You go to the bathroom when they say. You stand in line to\neat. The only way you can know what it's like is to be there.''\n\n   Today, at a 20-acre ranchette on the Mexican line, Lindstrom\nlives with her parents, an invalid uncle, chickens and dogs. It is\na peaceful place where she thinks of prohibition as the great\nconspiracy. Marijuana kills no one, she says, but alcohol and\ntobacco are lethal.\n\n   ``You tell me what the most dangerous drug is,'' she says.\n\n   If people fear crime, Lindstrom argues, they should hate a drug\nwar that increases the value of narcotics, empowers the\nnarco-cartels and makes criminals of harmless users.\n\n   ``You can't legislate morality. I wouldn't use cocaine if it was\navailable in Safeway,'' she says. ``But there are some people who\nwill use it whether it's legal or illegal.''\n\n   Lindstrom ridicules the idea of prison as an antidote to drugs,\npointing to her husband and her brother as examples.\n\n   Bartel, a former drug dealer, served no time behind bars. Today,\nhe's a productive member of society.\n\n   Callahan will spend 27 years in a federal penitentiary, away\nfrom his kids, producing nothing but anti-government essays.\n\n   ``You'll spend $23,000 a year to keep him there,'' Lindstrom\nsays. ``You can't warehouse people and say, `Well, but we're doing\ngood in this country.' Empty lives. Empty boxes. Empty Christmases.\nJust people sitting around, waiting for their time to be up.''\n\n   Today, Lindstrom takes solace in her own grown children. One son\nworks for the Cochise County Attorney's Office and ran for justice\nof the peace. The other, a college football player, tried for a pro\ncontract. Her daughter is a nurse.\n\n   None use drugs.\n\n   ``The problem today,'' she says, ``is most parents don't stay\nhome to tell their children. . . . I'm not saying I'm the greatest\nmother in the world. I certainly made mistakes, but . . .''   \nSECOND THOUGHTS\n\n   Former prosecutor Abrams, 52, shares a law office next to a\nTexaco station on the Naco Highway in the drug smuggling hub of\nArizona.\n\n   His walls are adorned with letters of recognition from his days\nwith the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\n   Abrams changed sides in the drug war 10 years ago during a\nmidlife crisis.\n\n   He moved from Phoenix to the border and began to see not just\nthe misery caused by drugs but the impact of America's enforcement\ncampaign.\n\n   ``We are one screwed-up nation,'' Abrams says. ``I mean, `the\ndrug war'? What is that? A social problem. . . . The drug war\nbenefits few people and creates more tragedies than identifiable\nvictories.''\n\n   He recalls running into Callahan's ex-wife at the local market.\n\n   ``I broke into tears. I said, `I'm sorry, so sorry. Not for\nprosecuting him. I'm sorry for the whole bloody mess.' ''\n\n   In Vietnam, innocent casualties were listed as ``collateral\ndamage.'' Abrams wrote a screenplay about similar victims in the\ndrug war, then agreed to collaborate on the book with Lindstrom and\nCallahan.\n\n   He's seen impoverished Mexicans sucked into the smuggling\nvortex, dragged away from weeping families while kingpins remained\nhidden, protected.\n\n   ``Crossing the drugs is a business where people are used and\nthrown away by drug lords,'' Abrams says.\n\n   The result: Parentless kids become gang-bangers. More lives are\nwasted. More drugs pour into America.\n\n   Through it all, enforcement agents risk their lives for nothing,\nhe says.\n\n   Many become robots _ working to keep a job, collect a check.\nSome grow jaded, breaking the law to make cases. A few sell out,\ntaking bribes.\n\n   ``It corrupts everything,'' Abrams says. ``There's a tremendous\namount of cynicism in law enforcement, and it's well-placed.''\n\n   Abrams admits he has reservations about legalizing hard drugs\nsuch as cocaine or methamphetamine. But that may be the lesser of\nevils.\n\n   ``I would prefer to err on the side of legalization because I\nthink the costs to society are less,'' he says.\n\n   He shakes his head and says Americans have surrendered their\nlegacy of freedom to the gods of drug control. He says the nation\nhas embraced unjust sentencing laws, racketeering statutes that\nviolate property rights, searches based on ethnicity.\n\n   ``The main reason cars get stopped down here,'' Abrams says,\n``is because the people driving 'em have brown skin.''\n\n   ``Everything is intertwined,'' he adds. `Yet we have one\nsolution. It's called jail. And do you know who makes out? The\npeople who build jails.''  \n","Headline":"\nFOR HOMEMAKER, DRUG TRADE `WAS A GAME, A BAD GAME' \n","Text":["\n   Smugglers, apparently spooked by law enforcement agents, stashed\nmarijuana on her border property near Bisbee Junction.
