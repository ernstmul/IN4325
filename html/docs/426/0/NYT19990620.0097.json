(Exclusive) \n (rk) \n By ROBERT PEAR   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to protect the privacy of medical\nrecords is dying under pressure from insurance companies, health\ncare businesses, law-enforcement officials and others lobbying\nCongress to preserve their access to sensitive information on\npatients.\n\n   As envisioned, the bill was supposed to establish comprehensive\nfederal standards for the confidentiality of medical records. The\ngoal of a uniform medical privacy standard was originally shared by\nconsumer advocates and the health care industry, which now operates\nunder rules that vary from state to state.\n\n   But some consumer and privacy advocates now say the bill, which\nhas been changed amid a spirited lobbying blitz, permits health\ninsurers, health care businesses and law enforcement officials to\nencroach on privacy rather than protect patients' confidentiality.\n\n   On four occasions in the last month, a Senate committee has\nscheduled and then canceled meetings to amend and vote on the\nlegislation, which would affect virtually everyone who receives,\nprovides or pays for health care in the United States: doctors,\npatients, hospitals, drugstores, employers, insurers, insurance\nagents and researchers, among others.\n\n   With so many competing interests swarming round the bill, it\nappears to be doomed.\n\n   Congress faces a deadline. If it does not act by August, Donna\nShalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is supposed to\nissue privacy-protection rules. But Congress could stop her or\nextend the deadline.\n\n   The stated purpose of the bill, drafted over the last three\nyears by Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., is to ``establish strong\nand effective mechanisms to protect against the unauthorized and\ninappropriate use of protected health information.''\n\n   In general, the bill says, health care providers and insurance\ncompanies may not disclose information from an individual's medical\nrecords unless the person has authorized such disclosure. But then,\nit says, anyone who wants health insurance must, ``as a condition\nof enrollment in the health plan,'' authorize the use and\ndisclosure of personal health information, not only for medical\ntreatment and the payment of claims, but also for the vaguely\ndefined purpose of ``health care operations.''\n\n   Critics say the bill would virtually force patients to give\nconsent, on penalty of losing their health insurance. A health plan\ncould deny coverage to people who refused to give consent.\n\n   James C. Pyles, an expert on privacy rights who represents the\nAmerican Psychoanalytic Association and many home health agencies,\nsaid: ``The bill recognizes a right to confidentiality, but\nessentially eliminates it by compelling the consent as a condition\nof obtaining insurance or even treatment in some cases. That's not\nreally consent; it's submission.''\n\n   George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at the\nBoston University School of Public Health, said: ``The bill tends\nto erode confidentiality more than it guarantees confidentiality.\nMore people would be authorized to have access to your medical\nrecords than have access under current law. Health plans and\nresearchers would say that's a good thing because it'll make the\nhealth care more efficient and speed up gene-based research to look\nfor new drugs.''\n\n   Under the bill, law-enforcement officials could request and\nobtain medical records in ``exigent circumstances'' if they were in\nhot pursuit of a suspect or a fugitive, or if they were simply\ntrying to locate and identify a material witness. Some health care\nprofessionals are particularly queasy about this aspect of the\nbill, although the Justice Department has endorsed it.\n\n   Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., executive vice president of the\nAmerican Medical Association, contends that the bill ``implicitly\ndeputizes physicians as law-enforcement officers,'' forcing doctors\nto violate their ethical duty to patients.\n\n   ``We are alarmed,'' Anderson said. ``The power that would be\nvested with law enforcement is nothing short of breathtaking.''\n\n   John T. Bentivoglio, chief privacy officer at the Justice\nDepartment, said: ``Our intent is not to deputize medical\nprofessionals as law-enforcement officers. But there are situations\nwhere we need medical information to investigate crimes and protect\npublic safety. In those situations, we feel it's reasonable for\nlaw-enforcement officers to have the information we need.''\n\n   Increasingly, health care is provided by large networks of\ndoctors, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies and\ninsurance companies that want to share certain types of information\non patients.\n\n   Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance\nAssociation of America, said: ``We don't favor indiscriminate\naccess to medical information. We use it only to enhance the\nquality of care and to prevent fraud and abuse.''\n\n   Health plans routinely use the information in their files to\ncontact women who need a mammogram or patients with a particular\ndisease who could benefit from a new drug.\n\n   Health maintenance organizations have developed many techniques\nto detect fraud, to learn which treatments are most effective, to\nevaluate the work of individual doctors and to identify those who\norder too many tests and procedures.\n\n   Insurers and HMOs say it is totally impractical for them to\nrequest permission each time they want to use a patient's medical\nrecords. Under Jeffords' bill and similar measures pending in the\nHouse, a health insurance company could require a patient to sign\none form authorizing all future use of the person's medical records\nfor ``treatment, payment and health care operations.''\n\n   Each of those terms is broadly defined in a way that seems to\ncodify current practices in the health care industry. ``Treatment''\nincludes risk assessment, disease management and the ``coordination\nof health care or other services among health care providers and\nthird parties authorized by the health plan.'' Likewise,\n``payment'' includes all sorts of activities to determine whether a\nservice is medically necessary.\n\n   ``Health care operations'' encompass almost everything for which\na health plan might want to use a patient's medical records:\n``quality assessment and improvement activities,'' developing\nclinical guidelines, reviewing the competence of doctors and\nnurses, tracking variations in medical practice, auditing claims\nand setting premiums and insurance rates based on the medical\nhistory of an individual or a group.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
