They said only that he was 26 years old and had been\na trooper for about 2 1/2 years.\n\n   The state patrolman suffered head and chest and injuries.\n\n   The medical examiner's office identified the dead man as Brian\nHeath Grooms, 26, of Columbus, Ohio.\n\n   Bellevue police said Grooms, a salesman, was a friend of the\nstate trooper and was in the Seattle area on vacation. He was\nriding in the back seat of the Dodge Strata when the crash\noccurred.\n\n   The Bellevue police officer driving the Strata had been drinking\nand was traveling southbound at ``a high rate of speed'' when he\nlost control of the vehicle, Johnson said.\n\n   The policeman's car went spinning across the center line and\ncollided with a northbound Ford Expedition driven by a 45-year-old\nBellevue man, who was identified only as a Navy officer.\n\n   There were two passengers in the Expedition _ the officer's\n53-year-old wife and a 78-year-old man in the back seat.
