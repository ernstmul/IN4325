Louis\nSheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, told the\npanel.\n\n   State lottery officials also opposed the bill, saying it would\nblock online lottery ticket sales even while allowing other kinds\nof gambling. ``State lotteries would be put at a competitive\ndisadvantage to other participants in the industry,'' said Greg\nZiemak, president of the North American Association of State and\nProvincial Lotteries.\n\n   With Clinton administration officials, state lottery\nrepresentatives and religious conservatives now ganging up on it,\nthe once-popular bill faces an uncertain future.\n\n   The measure got off to a strong start last year.\n\n   Sen.

Sports officials, both\nat the college and professional levels, joined the chorus calling\nfor curbs, saying the lure of Internet betting could overwhelm\nyoung athletes.\n\n   In theory, online gambling already is banned by a long-standing\nfederal law that prohibits the use of wires to transmit bets across\nstate lines. But most online gambling sites operate outside U.S.\nborders, beyond the reach of the law.\n\n   This legislation would cut off those offshore casinos by\nblocking their access to Internet service providers in the United\nStates. Under the bill, if a state or federal law enforcement\nagency were to notify a service provider of a gambling operation,\nwhether foreign or domestic, the provider would be required to take\ndown the Web site within 24 hours.\n\n   The Senate approved the legislation by unanimous consent last\nNovember. In April, the House Judiciary Committee approved it,\n21-8.\n\n   But as the bill's fine print started getting closer inspection,\nits progress has slowed in the House. At Thursday's hearing,\ntestimony called attention to the bill's exemptions for Internet\nbetting on horse racing, dog racing and jai alai.\n\n   Those ``loopholes'' are ``so big you could drive a truck through\nthem,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif.\n\n   Witnesses said several states now allow ``account wagering'' on\ndog and horse races. In those states, residents can register\nthemselves to place bets by telephone.
