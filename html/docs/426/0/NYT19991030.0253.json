Times News Service    \n\n   WILTON, Conn. _ Katy's behaving beautifully. She approaches the\nedge of the large lawn and pulls back, frightened, as if she's\nabout to fall off the end of the earth. ``She's an all-star,''\nannounces Tony Wilmot, a friendly man wearing a blue hat that says\n``Invisible Fence.''\n\n   Katy is a dog, a soft-coated wheaten terrier, and, for our\npurposes, a postmodern suburban pet learning to live within the\nconfines of an e-canine world.\n\n   Perhaps you've seen an Invisible Fence _ well, seen its results.\nA dog is on a lawn, doing its thing _ running, barking, sniffing _\nwhen it abruptly stops for no apparent reason. Suddenly, it is\nnosing and growling along an unseen wall, acting like Marcel\nMarceau trapped in an imaginary box.\n\n   A buried antenna wire transmits a beeping noise to a special\ncollar on the dog if it approaches the line of the ``fence.'' The\ndog is trained to turn back once it hears the beeping. If it\ndoesn't, the collar emits a positively Pavlovian low-level shock.\nTo paraphrase a certain Supreme Court justice, it's a high-tech\nleashing.\n\n   The Invisible Fence is a perfect appliance for suburban hamlets\nwhere boundaries of property and propriety are always there, even\nif you can't see them at first.\n\n   These fences are selling wildly, since more people have the\nmoney to pay for the pieces of a well-rounded life, but have less\ntime to attend to them. Working any kink out of the daily routine\nis worth the price.\n\n   ``Sometimes, owning a dog carries some guilt,'' said Kimberly S.\nLeasure, a spokeswoman for the Invisible Fence Co. ``Both spouses\nare working. There are kids. You come home, and there's a dog that\nis jumping up and wants your attention. It gives you a peace of\nmind to just open the door and give the dog the off-leash aerobic\nexercise he needs to be a member of the family and not a pain in\nthe butt.''\n\n   In case wiring your dog creates new guilt, the fence folks refer\nto the shock as ``a correction'' as in: ``Did the dog yelp when it\nreceived a correction?'' Dogs usually learn fast not to tempt fate,\nand the fence has the ASPCA seal of approval.\n\n   It's a move toward the walkless dog. That sets the imagination\nloose on other candidates for remote-control taming. Children. Men\nbearing buckets of black goop wanting to seal your driveway. People\nat your door promising eternal happiness in exchange for a magazine\nsubscription.\n\n   Wilmot says that almost every customer eventually suggests\ncollaring the kids, usually in jest. Susan Douglass, Katy's owner,\nwas holding the electronic collar and talking about her three\nchildren, when she joked, ``I'd like to put it on them.''\n\n   ``That's when the state gets involved,'' Wilmot responded,\nwithout missing a beat. (``I've used that a thousand times,'' he\nsaid later.)\n\n   The Canine Fence Co., started in Carol and Henry Hill's basement\n15 years ago, now has 168 employees and installs several thousand\nInvisible Fences a year as the Northeast distributor. They'll also\nwire indoors to keep the dog away from the Jacuzzi, the Christmas\ntree or the kids' homework. The Invisible Fence people provide\ntraining _ making a basic package cost about $600 for a\nquarter-acre _ and they look down their snouts at competitors who\nsimply sell homeowners the hardware, as if it's a weed whacker or\nsomething.\n\n   The company is well situated here in Fairfield County, where\nshaded roads edged with remnants of stone fences wind past estates\nnew and old. It is a landscape nourished by Wall Street through the\numbilical cord of the commuter railroad. Those magically contained\ndogs are just another detail of life that appears to have been\nattended to, even pampered, and put in its proper place.\n\n   Of course, achieving that delicate balance only looks easy.\n\n   As Wilmot pulls into Ms. Douglass' driveway, men from Morning\nMist, an underground sprinkler company, are leaving.\n\n   ``You're Invisible Fence?'' one of the Morning Mist men asks,\nseeing Wilmot's hat.\n\n   ``Yeah,'' says Wilmot. ``Be careful of the wire.''\n\n   ``You be careful of the pipe,'' the Mist man says.\n\n   Yet another struggle just beneath the surface of suburbia.\n","Headline":"\nIN SUBURBIA, FENCES VANISH BUT DOGS STAY\n","Text":["\n   WILTON, Conn. _ Katy's behaving beautifully.
