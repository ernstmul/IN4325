And he spends time with ``ER'' actress Ellen Crawford and\n``All My Children'' star T.C. Warner to help solve their dogs'\nproblems. (Crawford's shepherd was an escape artist who learned to\nsit and stay on command; Warner's small terrier was a problem child\nwho used her sofa for a bathroom until properly housebroken.)\n\n   ``The way to solve a problem is obedience training,'' Margolis\nsaid. ``When people get a puppy or a dog, they should go to the\nlibrary and get a book or a video and learn how to train it, not\njust start yelling when the dog does something wrong. They seem to\nthink that if they yell long enough and loud enough, the dog will\nunderstand. It doesn't work that way.\n\n   ``You have to learn how to teach your dog. Otherwise, it's like\ntrying to play the piano without knowing the keys.\n!ital!That's!off! what I try to teach people.''\n\n   The big three things to learn: Command (teach a dog what you\nwant him to do); correction (when he does it wrong, show him\nagain); and praise (with hugs and treats and delighted\nexclamations).\n\n   ``It's not harsh training, it's love training,'' Margolis said.\n``But you have to do it.
