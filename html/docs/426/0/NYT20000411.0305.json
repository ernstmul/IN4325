Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Following years of complaints of abusive government\nconduct, Congress completed legislation Tuesday that would make it\nharder for government officials to confiscate property before they\nactually bring criminal charges in narcotics, terrorism,\nracketeering and other cases.\n\n   Administration officials said that President Clinton would sign\nthe legislation, a compromise measure approved unanimously by a\nvoice vote of the House of Representatives on Tuesday and by the\nSenate two weeks ago. The new law adds significant safeguards that\nwill make it more difficult for prosecutors to seize homes, money,\ncars, boats and other property before trials begin. But it also\nexpands the government's authority to both discover tainted assets\nand confiscate property after convictions.\n\n   The U.S. Supreme Court and other courts have criticized the\ncurrent law, saying that lax standards had repeatedly permitted\nprosecutors to confiscate assets of innocent people long before\ncriminal trials began. Congressional hearings had documented many\ninstances where the asset seizures had created enormous hardships\nand required onerous litigation in order to try to win back money,\ncars, homes and businesses that were never part of any criminal\nscheme.\n\n   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary\nCommittee who introduced the first bill to change forfeiture laws\nseven years ago, said that the legislation approved Tuesday, which\nhe had co-sponsored, struck a fair balance between protecting\nproperty owners while continuing to permit the government to\nconfiscate assets upon proving that they may have been part of a\ncrime.\n\n   ``This bill is one we can all be proud of,'' Hyde said. ``It\nreturns civil asset forfeiture to the ranks of respected law\nenforcement tools that can be used without risk to the civil\nliberties and property rights of American citizens. We are all\nbetter off that this is so.''\n\n   The laws that were amended Tuesday were enacted as part of a\ntrend that began 30 years ago to expand the authority of law\nenforcement at the height of what were then called the wars on\ndrugs and terrorism.\n\n   Those laws were challenged this term in Congress by a remarkable\ncoalition of liberal and conservative lawmakers and a diverse array\nof organizations.\n\n   The groups critical of the current law included the American\nCivil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association, the American\nBankers Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense\nLawyers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Americans for Tax\nReform, and pilot, boating, hotel and housing organizations.\n\n   While most of the groups generally applauded Congress Tuesday\nfor taking an important first step in making it more difficult for\nthe government to confiscate assets without sufficient evidence of\nwrongdoing, some said further legislation was necessary to remedy\nthe abuses that had already been documented.\n\n   ``The situation is so bad that even modest reforms are\nimportant,'' said Rachel King, legislative counsel of the American\nCivil Liberties Union. ``We think this just begins to address the\nproblem.''\n\n   The legislation both flips the burden of proof to the government\nand raises the legal standard for seizures prior to conviction.\n\n   Under the existing law, once the government makes a relatively\nlow showing of probable cause that the property is subject to civil\nforfeiture, the same standard required for a search warrant, the\nonus shifts to the owner to establish that the property is\n``innocent.'' Codified into federal law, the standard has its roots\nin a legal fiction that an inanimate object can itself be\n``guilty'' of wrongdoing, a fiction that grew out of English common\nlaw and was adopted by the First Congress in 1789.\n\n   Since the standard for confiscating property remains so low, an\nowner is not automatically entitled to a return of confiscated\nproperty even if he is ultimately acquitted of a crime.\n\n   Under the new law, the government can confiscate property only\nif it first shows there was a substantial connection between the\nproperty and the crime ``by preponderance of the evidence,'' a\nhigher burden than probable cause.\n\n   The new law also expands possible defenses, awards lawyers fees\nto owners who successfully challenge the seizure of their property,\nand provides government-paid lawyers to indigent property owners in\nmany instances. It allows federal judges to release property to the\nowner if the government possession causes substantial hardship to\nthe owner and extends the time a property owner has to challenge\nthe seizure of an asset.\n\n   It also eliminates a provision that had required owners of\nconfiscated property to post a bond when they tried to contest the\nforfeiture.\n\n   But the legislation also offers some benefits to law enforcement\nofficials, which was necessary to win the support from the Justice\nDepartment. It will make it easier, for instance, for prosecutors\nto seize property after convictions. It also eases the statute of\nlimitations in criminal forfeiture actions; sets up a new procedure\nfor federal courts to enforce forfeiture judgments of foreign\nnations; and gives the government greater access to financial\nrecords in instances where the property may be held in secret\naccounts overseas.\n\n   Those provisions helped the chief sponsors of the legislation _\nReps. Hyde and John Conyers, D-Mich., in the House and Sens. Orrin\nG. Hatch, R-Utah, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., in the Senate _ to\nwin the support of the Clinton administration. At the urging of the\nJustice Department and local law enforcement groups, the White\nHouse had opposed legislation that had overwhelmingly passed the\nHouse last June that would have imposed even more restraints on law\nenforcement authorities.\n\n   That legislation had required the government to prove that the\nassets in question were part of a criminal scheme by ``clear and\nconvincing evidence,'' a higher standard than the ``preponderance''\ntest adopted Tuesday.
