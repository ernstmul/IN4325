Times News Service   \n\n   The Clinton administration has developed a plan for an extensive\ncomputer monitoring system, overseen by the FBI, to protect the\nnation's crucial data networks from intruders.\n\n   The plan, an outgrowth of the administration's anti-terrorism\nprogram, has already raised concerns from civil liberties groups.\n\n   A draft of the plan, prepared by officials at the National\nSecurity Council last month and provided to The New York Times by a\ncivil liberties group, calls for a sophisticated software system to\nmonitor activities on non-military government networks and a\nseparate system to track networks used in the banking,\ntelecommunications and transportation industries.\n\n   The effort, whose details are still being debated within the\nadministration, is intended to alert law enforcement officials to\nattacks that might cripple governmental operations or the nation's\neconomy.\n\n   But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers\nand their emerging role as a backbone of the nation's commerce,\npolitics and culture, critics of the proposed system say it could\nbecome a building block for a surveillance infrastructure with\ngreat potential for misuse.\n\n   They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could\nitself be open to security breaches, giving intruders or\nunauthorized users a vast window into government and corporate\ncomputer systems.\n\n   The Defense Department began deploying such a system three years\nago. But Government officials said that the changing nature of\nmilitary threats in the information age had altered the nature of\nnational security concerns and created a new sense of urgency to\nprotect the nation's information infrastructure.\n\n   ``Our concern about organized cyber attack has escalated\ndramatically,'' Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security Council's\ndirector of information protection, who is overseeing the plan,\nsaid Tuesday. ``We do know of a number of hostile foreign\ngovernments that are developing sophisticated and well organized\noffensive cyber attack capabilities and we have good reason to\nbelieve that terrorists may be developing similar capabilities.''\n\n   As part of the plan, networks of thousands of software\nmonitoring programs would constantly track computer activities,\nlooking for indications of computer network intrusions and other\nillegal acts.\n\n   The plan calls for the creation of a Federal Intrusion Detection\nNetwork, or Fidnet, and specifies that the data it collects will be\ngathered in a centralized data center at the National\nInfrastructure Protection Center, an interagency task force housed\nat the FBI.\n\n   Such a system, to be put fully in place by 2003, is meant to\npermit government security experts to track ``patterns of\npatterns'' of information and respond in a coordinated manner\nagainst intruders and terrorists.\n\n   For example, officials said that such a system might have\nprotected against intrusions recently reported in computers at the\nBureau of Labor Statistics, which produces information like the\nconsumer price index that can affect the performance of the stock\nmarket.\n\n   The draft report, which has been circulated widely within the\nexecutive branch, has generated concern among some officials over\nits privacy implications. Several officials involved in the debate\nover the plan said that the situation was ``fluid'' and that many\naspects were still not final.\n\n   The report is vague on several crucial points, including the\nkinds of data to be collected and the specific federal and\ncorporate computer networks to be monitored. The report also lacks\ndetails about the ways information collected in non-governmental\nagencies would be maintained and under what conditions it would be\nmade available to law enforcement personnel.\n\n   Government officials said that the National Security Council was\nconducting a legal and technical review of the plan and that a\nfinal report is scheduled to be released in September, subject to\nPresident Clinton's approval.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The plan was created in response to a presidential directive in\nMay 1998 requiring the executive branch to review the\nvulnerabilities of the federal government's computer systems in\norder to become a ``model of information and security.''\n\n   In a cover letter to the draft plan Clinton writes, ``A\nconcerted attack on the computers of any one of our key economic\nsectors or governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.''\n\n   But the plan strikes at the heart of a growing controversy over\nhow to protect the nation's computer systems while also protecting\ncivil liberties _ particularly since it would put a new and\npowerful tool into the hands of the FBI.\n\n   Increasingly, data flowing over the Internet is becoming a vital\ntool for law enforcement, and civil liberties experts said law\nenforcement agencies would be under great temptation to expand the\nuse of the information in pursuit of suspected criminals.\n\n   ``The report clearly recognizes the civil liberties\nimplications,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center\nfor Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group,\n``But it brushes them away.''\n\n   The draft plan states: ``As access to relevant networks is\npremised on `consent' of the user to allow session monitoring, the\ncollection of certain data identified as anomalous activity or a\nsuspicious event would not be considered a privacy issue.''\n\n   Dempsey conceded the legal validity of the point, but said there\nwas tremendous potential for abuse.\n\n   ``My main concern is that Fidnet is an ill-defined monitoring\nsystem of potentially broad sweep,'' he said. ``It seems to place\nmonitoring and surveillance at the center of the government's\nresponse to a problem that is not well suited to such measures.''\n\n   The federal government is making a concerted effort to insure\nthat civil liberties and privacy rights are not violated by the\nplan, Hunker said.\n\n   He said that data gathered from non-government computer networks\nwill be collected separately from the FBI-controlled monitoring\nsystem at a separate location within a General Services\nAdministration building. He said that was done to keep\nnon-government data at arm's length from law enforcement.\n\n   The plan also has drawn concern from civil libertarians because\nit blends civilian and military functions in protecting the\nnation's computer networks. The report notes that there is already\na Department of Defense ``contingent'' working at the FBI's\ninfrastructure protection center to integrate intelligence,\ncounterintelligence and law enforcement efforts in protecting\nPentagon computers.\n\n   ``The fight over this could make the fight over encryption look\nlike nothing,'' said Mary Culnan, an professor at Georgetown\nUniversity who served on a presidential commission whose work led\nto the May 1998 directive on infrastructure protection. ``The\nconceptual problem is that there are people running this program\nwho don't understand how citizens feel about privacy in\ncyberspace.''\n\n   The government has been discussing the proposal widely with a\nnumber of industry security committees and associations in recent\nmonths.\n\n   Several industry executives said there is still reluctance on\nthe part of industry to directly share information on computer\nintrusions with law enforcement.\n\n   ``They want to control the decision-making process,'' said Mark\nRasch, vice president and general counsel of Global Integrity, a\ncompany in Reston, Va., that coordinates computer security for the\nfinancial services industries.\n\n   One potential problem in carrying out the government's plan is\nthat intrusion-detection software technology is still immature,\nindustry executives said.\n\n   ``The commercial intrusion detection systems are not ready for\nprime time,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI\nInternational in Menlo Park, Calif., and a pioneer in the field of\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n   Current systems tend to generate false alarms and thus require\nmany skilled operators.\n\n   But a significant portion of the $1.4 billion the Clinton\nadministration has requested for computer security for fiscal year\n2000 is intended to be spent on research, and government officials\nsaid they were hopeful that the planned effort would be able to\nrely on automated detection technologies and on artificial\nintelligence capabilities.\n\n   For several years computer security specialists have used\nsoftware variously known as packet filters or ``sniffers'' as\nmonitoring devices to track computer intruders. Like telephone\nwiretaps, such tools can be used to reconstruct the activities of a\ncomputer user as if a videotape were made of his computer display.\n\n   At the same time, however, the software tools are routinely\nmisused by illicit computer network users to steal information such\nas passwords or other data.\n\n   In the past three years, the Pentagon has begun to string\ntogether entire network surveillance systems by outfitting them\nwith filters that report data to a central site, much as a burglar\nalarm might be reported at the local police station.\n\n   Moreover, commercial vendors are beginning to sell monitoring\ntools that combine packet filtering with more sophisticated and\nautomated intrusion detection software that tries to detect abuse\nby looking for behavior patterns or certain sequences of commands.\n","Headline":"\nGOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO MONITOR BANKING AND OTHER COMPUTER\nNETWORKS \n","Text":["\n   The Clinton administration has developed a plan for an extensive\ncomputer monitoring system, overseen by the FBI, to protect the\nnation's crucial data networks from intruders.\n","\n   The plan, an outgrowth of the administration's anti-terrorism\nprogram, has already raised concerns from civil liberties groups.\n","\n   A draft of the plan, prepared by officials at the National\nSecurity Council last month and provided to The New York Times by a\ncivil liberties group, calls for a sophisticated software system to\nmonitor activities on non-military government networks and a\nseparate system to track networks used in the banking,\ntelecommunications and transportation industries.\n","\n   The effort, whose details are still being debated within the\nadministration, is intended to alert law enforcement officials to\nattacks that might cripple governmental operations or the nation's\neconomy.\n","\n   But because of the increasing power of the nation's computers\nand their emerging role as a backbone of the nation's commerce,\npolitics and culture, critics of the proposed system say it could\nbecome a building block for a surveillance infrastructure with\ngreat potential for misuse.\n","\n   They also argue that such a network of monitoring programs could\nitself be open to security breaches, giving intruders or\nunauthorized users a vast window into government and corporate\ncomputer systems.\n","\n   The Defense Department began deploying such a system three years\nago.
