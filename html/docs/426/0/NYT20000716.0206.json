Kip Holden, a Baton Rouge Democrat, said Sunday. ``It's going\nto be a big debate. It's going to be a very complicated\nprocedure.''\n\n   The lawmakers are in Chicago through Thursday for the National\nConference of State Legislatures, which will address myriad state\nand federal issues. More than 5,000 legislators and their staff are\nexpected.\n\n   Holden is chairman of the organization's Law and Justice\nCommittee, which sponsored one of the forums Saturday that kicked\noff the convention. Holden's forum focused on police circumvention\nof forfeiture laws and was prompted by information in a two-day\nseries published in May in The Kansas City Star.\n\n   Most states have laws that block seized money from going\ndirectly back to police because they don't want police profiting\nfrom crime fighting, The Star found.\n\n   The series also showed that police in more than two dozen states\noften hand off property and cash they seize in drug cases to a\nfederal agency, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The\nagency keeps a cut, usually 20 percent, and returns the rest to\npolice.\n\n   At the request of the organization, Craig Nienaber, The Star's\nprojects editor, presented the series' findings during the Saturday\nforum.\n\n   Two panelists, Steve Kessler, a New York criminal defense\nattorney, former prosecutor and national expert on state and\nfederal forfeiture laws, and Gene Voegtlin, legislative counsel for\nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, spoke on the\nsubject.\n\n   Missouri state Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, also\nspoke about the problem in Missouri and his bill to correct it.\n\n   The host organization has a policy meant to discourage police\nfrom avoiding states' laws when seeking asset forfeiture.\n\n   After hearing the panelists and the questions raised by a dozen\nlegislators, Holden said Sunday he would request that the issue\nalso be put on the agenda of the organization's December meeting.\n\n   He said it would be important to have attorneys general,\ndistrict attorneys and state judges represented in December, as\nwell as members of law enforcement and the federal government.\n\n   Holden said he believed the American Bar Association also should\nbe involved.\n\n   ``The ABA should be in the forefront of dealing with this\nissue'' he said.\n\n   Voegtlin, legislative counsel for the police chiefs'\nassociation, said during the Saturday forum that forfeiture is an\nimportant law enforcement tool.\n\n   ``Forfeiture in the views of our members is probably one of the\nmost effective weapons that law enforcement has in the war against\ncrime,'' he said. ``Nothing, I think, makes more sense than for law\nenforcementto be able to take the proceeds out of the hands of drug\ndealers and the associates of that money.''\n\n   Voegtlin said, however, the need for an aggressive fight against\ncrime appears to be swinging back from the 1980s, when federal laws\nwere passed that allowed police and federal law enforcement to\nshare forfeited drug money.\n\n   ``Back in '84 and in the early '90s, the nation was in the midst\nof a pretty massive crime wave,'' Voegtlin said. ``I think that\neverything that could be done to empower law enforcement to protect\nthe citizens was being done.\n\n   ``Now we have years of declining crime rates and people feel\nsafer in their homes. Perhaps there is beginning to be some feeling\nthat perhaps the criminal justice system needs to be reined in.''\n\n   Kessler, who has published two treatises on forfeiture law, said\nif local and state police were made to follow state laws,\nforfeiture would radically change.\n\n   But he said that would be difficult because forfeiture has\nbecome ``unquestionably the largest, most lucrative business in the\nUnited States.''\n\n   At the forum, he discussed a case in Arkansas in which the state\npolice seized $3.2 million and handed it off to the federal\ngovernment, expecting to get 80 percent back. State law would have\nallowed the agency to keep $250,000. The rest would have gone to a\nstatewide law enforcement fund.\n\n   But the prosecutor took the case to the state Supreme Court,\nwhich ruled that the police could not keep the money they wanted.\nThe agency appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to\nhear the case.\n\n   ``This is a fight between law enforcement agencies,'' Kessler\nsaid. ``And it is not that uncommon.''\n\n   He pointed out that in some Texas counties and Southern states,\nsheriff's salaries are based on the proceeds of forfeiture. Across\nthe country, the operation of law enforcement drug task forces\ndepends on that money.\n\n   ``An old adage is police should not eat what they kill,''\nKessler said. ``These are not isolated incidents. The best way to\nreduce the abuse related to civil forfeiture is to defuse the\nincentive.\n\n   ``As long as the mouse gets to keep the cheese, then the\ncorruption within the system, through no fault of law enforcement,\nwill remain,'' he said.\n\n   Forfeiture is easier under federal law than under most state\nlaws, Kessler said, which is why police often ask a federal agency\nto ``adopt'' a seizure. Most state laws carry strong protections\nfor citizens' property.\n\n   For example, some states require a conviction or at least\nevidence of a felony crime before a judge can order property\nforfeited. Federal law does not have such a provision. Kessler said\nthat in 80 percent of federal civil forfeiture cases, a person's\nproperty is taken without a conviction.\n\n   Federal law also allows a law enforcement agency rather than a\njudge to declare property forfeited, Kessler said, and that's what\nhappens in a great majority of federal cases.\n","Headline":"\nLEGISLATORS WRESTLE WITH ASSET FORFEITURE POLICY, LAWS \n","Text":["\n   CHICAGO _ As hundreds of state legislators from around the\ncountry gather here this week, some are talking about finding ways\nto stop police from evading state forfeiture laws.\n","\n   Some want to tighten their laws to prevent police from using\nfederal law enforcement agencies to improperly keep millions of\ndollars in seized drug money.\n","\n   Others represent states with November voter initiatives that\nwould keep seized money out of police coffers.\n","\n   ``Clearly, asset forfeiture is something that needs to be\nrevisited by legislators throughout the country,'' Louisiana state\nRep.
