I always thought Ray Kroc was the founder. Can you\nexplain?\n\n   A: Kroc was a franchise genius credited with making the\nMcDonald's empire what it is today, but he wasn't the originator of\nthe fast-food burger-and-fries concept. Richard McDonald, who died\nat 89 Tuesday in Manchester, N.H., and his brother, Maurice, were\nthe ones who pioneered what would become the giant chain. It also\nwas Richard McDonald, not Kroc, who dreamed up the company's\nsymbol, the ``golden arches.''\n\n   The McDonald brothers first operated a car-hop shop in 1940 in\nSan Bernardino, Calif. After World War II ended, as freeways opened\nand customers became interested in speedy service, the brothers\ncame up the idea of a limited-menu place serving inexpensive food\nfast. In December 1948, they opened their first hamburger stand in\nSan Bernardino, and by 1954 they had sold 21 franchises and opened\nnine outlets.\n\n   Kroc, a food service equipment salesman who owned marketing\nrights to milkshake mixers, saw the potential for the brothers'\nconcept and became their franchise agent. In 1955, Kroc founded\nFranchise Realty Corp., and opened his first McDonald's store in\nDes Plaines, Ill. In 1960, he changed the name to McDonald's Corp.,\nand in 1961bought world franchise rights from the McDonald brothers\nfor $2.7 million.\n\n   After the sale, Richard McDonald returned to his native New\nHampshire. Brother Maurice died in 1971. Kroc died in 1984.\n\n   Q: A recent article reported that the government is trying to\ntrack down more than 7,000 people who are owed pensions they earned\nfrom private defined pension plans that have been closed. The\npeople's names are posted on the Internet. What is the address?\n\n   A: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. is undertaking the\nproject. Those with computer access can search easily by name,\ncompany and/or state by using the Pension Search Directory on the\nPBGC's Internet site: http://search.pbgc.gov\n\n   Q: Where did the term ``honky-tonk'' come from? I've got a bet\nriding on this.\n\n   A: There are several theories, so you and your bet-mate will\nhave to decide which to accept. The book Picturesque Expressions: A\nThematic Dictionary says the origin lies in the ``tinny, honklike\nsounds of ragtime heard in cheap nightclubs and brothels.''\n\n   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins traces\nthe first printed use of the word, describing a ``cheap dance hall\nfeaturing gambling or burlesque,'' to a February 1894 Oklahoma\nnewspaper. It reported on a honk-a-tonk ``well attended by\nball-heads, bachelors and leading citizens.'' The encyclopedia says\nno one is sure how the word originated, adding that the British\nattribute it to America, relating it to the slang word ``honky.''\nIt goes on to say an American authority claims it's from the\nEnglish word ``bonk,'' meaning ``to idle about.''\n\n   The word honky, by the way, is defined in the Morris Dictionary\nof Word and Phrase Origins as a corruption of hunkie or hunky, ``a\nslurring term originally applied to white laboring-class men of\nHungarian origin.''\n\n   Q: I thought the first gold strike or discovery of gold in the\nUnited States was at Dahlonega, Ga. However, the Reed Historical\nSite in North Carolina says it's the first site. Can you clarify?\n\n   A: A gold nugget the size of a small smoothing iron was found at\nthe Reed Mine in Cabarrus County, N.C., in 1799. Gold in limited\nquantities was discovered in the area, but the word ``strike,''\nimplying a sizable quantity, wouldn't apply. Dahlonega lays claim\nto the first important discovery of gold in the United States in\n1828. The federal government established a mint there that operated\nfrom 1838 to 1861, when it closed because of Georgia's break with\nthe Union.\n\n   Q: What are my legal rights if I see a pet or child left\nunattended in a hot parked car? Realizing that one has only so much\ntime to locate the driver, what is the best course of action?\n\n   A: Your question implies a conclusion that you should ``do\nsomething'' and mentions your ``rights.'' The real question, said\nDaryl Robinson of the Georgia Department of Law, is what are your\nresponsibilities. Assuming you're a stranger acting as a ``Good\nSamaritan,'' you have no legal obligation; but the Good Samaritan\nlaw protects you if you act in good faith.\n\n   Several considerations are involved, Robinson said. For example,\nhas the child (or pet) been unattended for one minute or one hour?\nIf it's a child, do you know if he or she is asleep, or suffering\nfrom heat exhaustion? Are you thinking about breaking a car window\nor forcing a door, and if so, do you really have enough facts to\ntake such action?\n\n   For these reasons, unless a clear emergency is apparent, the\nsafer response under most circumstances is to notify the nearest\nlaw enforcement officer, Robinson said. That person will deal with\nthe situation in an official capacity.\n\n   Q: In two recent movies, ``Titanic'' and ``Contact,'' when\npeople are calling on the radio, they say ``CQ'' before stating\ntheir message. What does that mean?\n\n   A: CQ originated as a general call preceding the transmission of\nradio signals (it stands for Call to Quarters ), and evolved as a\ngeneral call to talk to anyone interested. CQD (Come Quick _\nDanger) was an international distress signal used before SOS.\n\n   Q: It was reported recently that three German men who worked on\nthe rocket team that put Americans on the moon all died within\nthree days of each other, all in the Huntsville, Ala., area. What\nhappened to these men?\n\n   A: According to published accounts, all three members of the\ndwindling ranks of Wernher von Braun's World War II German rocket\nteam _ Max Nowak, Heinrich Paetz and Albert Schuler _ died of\nnatural causes. Although it may seem unusual, perhaps, that all\ndied within less than a week, they were of a certain age: Nowak,\n89; Paetz, 88; and Schuler, 83. As reported by The Associated\nPress, the original von Braun team consisted of 127 scientists.\nOnly about 30 to 40 are still living, said Ernst Stuhlinger, von\nBraun's chief assistant, and Konrad Dannenberg, a propulsion\nengineer for von Braun, both in Huntsville. Of that group, about a\ndozen remain in Huntsville, home of NASA's Marshall Space Flight\nCenter and the Army's Redstone Arsenal.\n\n   Q: Is it safe to be in a boat when lightning is occurring?\n\n   A: Experts say you should never offer yourself as a potential\ntarget when lightning threatens. The best advice to help save your\nlife is to get out of the water and off small boats, and not to use\nmetal objects such as fishing rods.\n\n   Q: I understand that cooking meat kills the E. coli bacteria.\nDoes cooking also affect in any way the growth hormone that might\nbe present in meat?\n\n   A: Since cooking methods and temperatures vary, it's difficult\nto say that cooking has a particular effect on hormones in meat,\nsaid Judy Harrison of the University of Georgia department of foods\nand nutrition. But you needn't be too concerned about the hormone\nissue, she added. For one thing, hormones occur naturally in\nanimals. And for another, the Agriculture Department's Food Safety\nand Inspection Service conducts an extensive monitoring program to\nprevent the marketing of animals containing unacceptable levels of\nanimal drugs, pesticides and other chemicals. Human bodies, by the\nway, produce hormones in quantities much greater than ever would be\neaten in beef or any other food, Harrison said.\n\n   Q: Aren't telemarketing calls limited to certain hours? I got a\nsolicitation at 8:25 a.m. recently. I thought such calls weren't\npermitted before 9 a.m.\n\n   A: With some exceptions, the hours are restricted by federal law\nto 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., according to the American Telemarketing\nAssociation in North Hollywood, Calif. The two governing rules used\nby telemarketers are the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the\nTelemarketing Sales Rule, an ATA representative said. Some states\nimpose variations, and some states follow business hours, which\nvary, he added.\n\n   Q: Is it true, as I have heard, that chocolate is poison for\ndogs?\n\n   A: Chocolate could prove fatal to a dog in some cases, said Dr.\nEdward Taylor of Alpharetta, past president of the Georgia\nVeterinary Medical Association. You might not notice a problem,\nother than agitation or nervousness, if healthy dogs eat small\namounts of chocolate. But larger amounts _ several mouthfuls, for\nexample _ can cause a fast heartbeat or other heart rhythm\nabnormalities, similar in effect to caffeine in humans, that could\nresult in death in a dog, especially if the animal already has\nheart problems. The culprit in chocolate is the chemical\ntheobromine, Taylor said.\n\n   END\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   UNDATED: Of the world's major religions, which ones have the\nmost members?\n","\n   Q: An obituary for Richard McDonald said he was a co-founder of\nMcDonald's.
