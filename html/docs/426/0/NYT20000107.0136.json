Times News Service   \n\n   Shakespeare was great at writing plays but lousy at inventing\nplots. So he borrowed them.\n\n   ``Romeo and Juliet,'' for instance, was lifted from ``The\nTragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet,'' a 1562 translation of a\ntale by Matteo Bandello, an Italian writer, soldier and monk.\n``Julius Caesar'' came out of Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation\nof Plutarch's ``Lives of Nobel Grecians and Romans.''\n\n   Nobody sued for breach of copyright because there wasn't any. By\nand large, the work of artists, inventors and scientists was\navailable for others to copy, improve or improvise on at will.\n\n   Of course, that hasn't been true the last couple of hundred\nyears. The idea of a copyright _ to establish personal ownership of\nartworks, ideas, techniques and other intellectual property _ was\nincluded in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution. In 1989, Americans\ntook out 95,537 patents; in 1998 the number reached 147,521 and\n72,395 more were issued to foreigners.\n\n   In 1998, Congress extended existing copyright protection for an\nadditional 20 years. Major beneficiaries were corporations like\nDisney, whose copyright on Mickey Mouse, for example, was to expire\nin 2004, but has now been extended.\n\n   Since then, criticism has been building in the academic world,\nwith many arguing that the growing privatization of knowledge will\nthreaten traditional intellectual and artistic freedoms.\n\n   ``Industries and governments always favor strong intellectual\nproperty protection; academics tend to favor weaker protection,''\nsaid Robert P. Merges, an expert on intellectual property law at\nthe University of California at Berkeley. ``If you took a poll of\nAmerican academics, you'd find most believe the knowledge grab has\ngone too far.''\n\n   This year, a group of Harvard University law professors asked\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to declare the\nCopyright Extension Act of 1998 unconstitutional. They argued that\nit violated guarantees of free speech by reprivatizing works that\nwould otherwise have become public property. They also said it\nbreached a constitutional requirement that copyright laws ``promote\nthe progress of science and useful arts.''\n\n   ``Extending a dead author's copyright won't encourage him to\nwrite another book,'' said Lawrence Lessig, one of the Harvard\nprofessors bringing the case. ``Would Shakespeare have written\n`Romeo and Juliet' if he had to get permission from Bandello and\npay royalties?''\n\n   The court rejected the argument, and the professors have\nappealed.\n\n   Patents and copyrights are essentially a monopoly that the\ngovernment grants for a limited time to encourage art and invention\nby publicizing new discoveries while ensuring the authors a fair\nreturn.\n\n   In his book ``Knowledge Diplomacy,'' a study of the\ninternational diplomacy of intellectual property rights, Michael P.\nRyan, of Georgetown University, explains: ``From its beginning, the\nbasic contract between the innovator and society has been that,\nrather than safeguarding the know-how of an innovation through the\ndarkness of trade secrets, the innovator discloses the know-how in\nexchange for a limited period of exclusivity to produce and\nauthorize to produce.''\n\n   After World War II, he writes, ``industrial diplomacy'' created\nglobal markets for manufactured goods. Today, that has been\nreplaced by ``knowledge diplomacy,'' which is ``institutionalizing\ntrade in products of invention and expression, offering innovators\nthe incentive to make their products for the global market.''\n\n   While some of the fastest growth in copyrights has been in the\nfield of computer software (where the number of patents granted is\nexpected to increase to 22,500 for 1999 from 1,300 in 1990),\ncompanies are increasingly patenting such innovations as methods of\ndoing business.\n\n   Amazon.com, the online bookseller, for example, has patented its\n``one click'' sales system, allowing customers to place new orders\nwith a single press on the computer mouse. Priceline.com has done\nthe same for ``reverse auctions,'' which enable buyers to name a\nprice and find a seller. Applications for such ``business method''\npatents have risen 70 percent this year, according to the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office.\n\n   Critics say that the current laws on intellectual property may\nshrink the pool of freely available artworks and ideas from which\nartists and inventors often draw their inspiration.\n\n   In ``Shamans, Software and Spleens: Law and the Construction of\nthe Information Society'' (Harvard University Press), James Boyle\nof American University argues that the present system\noveremphasizes the rights of the romanticized author at the expense\nof ``the public domain necessary to give the magpie genius the raw\nmaterial she needs.''\n\n   Already many universities and colleges have stopped providing\nstudents with photocopied anthologies of learned articles as an\nintroduction to their courses. Those that still do may charge an\nadditional fee to cover royalties.\n\n   Ronald V. Bettif, a communications professor at Pennsylvania\nState University, writes in his book ``Copyrighting Culture: the\nPolitical Economy of Intellectual Property''(Westview Press): ``The\nconsequences of expanded intellectual property rights are always\nthe same: the continuing enclosure of the intellectual and artistic\ncommons.''\n\n   More and more knowledge and culture are being privately\nappropriated and submitted to the logic of the marketplace,'' he\nwrites.\n\n   What is patented is supposed to be novel, useful and not\nobvious. Today, many critics feel the U.S. Patent and Trademark\nOffice is granting patents too readily with insufficient research\nto establish that what it protects really is new and useful.\n\n   ``The PTO refuses to give examiners enough time, money and\nresources to search for relevant `prior art' to establish\nnovelty,'' said Gregory Aharonian, who runs the specialist Internet\nPatent Newservice in San Francisco.\n\n   As examples of what he calls ``ridiculous patents'' he cites one\nfor a disposable razor with a small mirror attached so the shaver\ncan watch himself shave and another for a dog collar that\ndiscourages dogs from barking by buzzing them when they do.\n\n   Lessig agrees. ``It takes $1.2 million on average to challenge\nthe validity of a patent, which means it is often cheaper simply to\npay the royalties than establish that a patent isn't deserved,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Although many academic experts say copyrights can have\nsuffocating side effects, few argue for their abandonment. Boyle,\nfor instance, favors establishing a new property right that would\nencourage native peoples to preserve forests and their tribal lore\nby receiving royalty payments from pharmaceutical companies that\nuse the plants they live among and the natives' knowledge of them\nto make profitable drugs.\n\n   Sales of a drug derived from the rosy periwinkle found in\nMadagascar is used to treat Hodgkin's disease and are worth about\n$100 million a year, he points out. But Madagascar gets nothing and\nits people chop down their forests to live.\n\n   ``Who knows what other unique and potentially valuable plants\ndisappear with the forest, what generations of pharmacological\nexperience disappear as the indigenous culture is destroyed?'' he\nasks.\n\n   Others argue that not only researchers but also participants in\nexperimental research should benefit from resulting medical\nadvances. Boyle cites the case of John Moore vs. the Regents of the\nUniversity of California, in which American courts decided that a\npatient had no rights deriving from medical information about\nproteins that regulate the immune system discovered through\nresearch on his spleen.\n\n   Ryan writes that the United States, at the urging of business,\nhas been aggressively pushing other countries to accept its system\nof intellectual property rights in international trade\nnegotiations. The results are mixed, however.\n\n   Susan K. Sell, the author of ``Power and Ideas: North-South\nAspects of Intellectual Property and Antitrust,'' argues that\ndespite ``their glaring vulnerability to trade threats, developing\ncountries have not enforced intellectual property protection'' and\n``do not believe in it at this point.''\n\n   Washington is nonetheless likely to press for enforcement. Ryan\nputs the cost of foreign piracy to American industry at more than\n$10 billion in 1996, including $1.8 billion in the film industry,\n$1.2 billion in music, $3.8 billion in business application\nsoftware, and $690 million in book publishing.\n","Headline":"\nTHE KNOWLEDGE GRAB VS.
