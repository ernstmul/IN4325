Boiling clouds\nturn daylight into night. They are nature's signs that a storm is\ncoming _ a storm that can sometimes turn an otherwise calm animal\ninto a frenzied fur ball.\n\n   Instinct tells them they need to move. Run. Hide. Some pace,\nsome pant. Some begin to tremble.\n\n   Whether it's a dog, cat, horse or even a giraffe, severe\nthunderstorms such as those that rumbled through the area this week\ncan truly frighten animals _ even to death.\n\n   During storms, dogs have thrown themselves through plate-glass\nwindows trying to get inside a house, or ripped their teeth out\ntrying to break free of a chain, said Chris Duarte, a dog\nbehaviorist and owner of K-9 Connection, a training school for dog\nowners in Kansas City.\n\n   ``We had a client with a golden retriever who would literally\ntry to hide in the smallest space possible,'' Duarte said. ``One\nday the owners came home and found him with his head stuck in a\nsmall plastic toy. He had suffocated.''\n\n   And it's not just domestic animals that are afraid of storms. At\nthe Kansas City Zoo Tuesday morning, the giraffes wouldn't leave\ntheir stalls.\n\n   ``They were leery of coming out,'' said Agelon Jones, zoo area\nsupervisor. ``They don't like storms. I guess it was too much for\nthem. We didn't force them to leave. When an animal weighs 1,400\npounds and stands at least 15 feet tall, if they decide they don't\nwant to come out, they don't.''\n\n   And they didn't.\n\n   Other animals accustomed to life outdoors also may panic _ even\ndomestic livestock.\n\n   At 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, one loud ``BOOM!'' jolted awake horsewoman\nTammy Kesemann, owner of TnT Equine Center in Odessa, Mo. Cruiser,\nher stallion, was in the pasture. ``I had to go get him,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   When she found him in the field, Cruiser was trembling and\nnervous. ``He was ready to come in,'' she said. ``I've known about\nhorses and cattle that have been struck by lightning. I didn't want\nto take any chances with him. He's too valuable.''\n\n   Many dog and cat owners also feel their animals are valuable _\nemotionally.\n\n   So they'll coo to pets to calm their whining. They'll hug them\nto stop their trembling. They'll pour out attention to them. And,\nin the process, they unwittingly teach their pets to fear even\nmore.\n\n   ``When you let your dog in bed with you, you're reinforcing his\nfears,'' said veterinarian John Cousins, of Animed of Blue Springs,\nMo. ``It feels like you're helping him, but what happens when\nyou're not there?''\n\n   An animal running in a frenzy to escape or hide can harm itself.\nBut crating a dog is not a good way to keep it calm either, Duarte\nsaid.\n\n   One trainer he knew put a dog on an airplane without first\nacclimating the animal to the loud noises it would hear during the\nflight.\n\n   ``Before the plane landed, the dog ripped itself out of its\ncage, hurting itself in the process, sending blood everywhere,'' he\nsaid. ``It ripped up the suitcases and clothes. By the time they\nopened the cargo hold it was a nightmarish scene.''\n\n   Fortunately the dog lived.\n\n   There are things that pet owners can do to help animals cope,\nCousins said, primarily through drugs or desensitization.\n\n   Prescriptions ranging from a mild form of Valium to a\nlonger-lasting drug, Tranxene, are available from veterinarians.\nThe drugs should be administered hours before a storm begins, to\nhelp ease the pet before stress sets in.\n\n   ``The problem with drugs is that sometimes the owner isn't there\nto give it to the dog,'' he said. ``But an animal behaviorist can\noften help the dog to be less afraid.''\n\n   Teaching owners how to help their dogs is Duarte's speciality.\nOne technique he uses is the systematic playing of a tape of\nthunderstorms for storm-phobic dogs.\n\n   ``We tell owners to play it softly at first and gradually turn\nthe volume up,'' he said. ``But even then, the success depends on\nhow diligent the trainer is, and how the dog takes to it. Rarely\ndoes a bad case ever go away completely, but it can be lessened.''\n\n   Storm phobia is a strong fear. Sometimes even a hunting dog\naccustomed to gunshots still panics during bad weather.\n\n   Jim Lyons of the Lyons Den Kennel in Kingsville, Mo., trains\nhunting dogs. A dog can learn to accept loud noises, Lyons said, if\ntraining begins early.\n\n   ``But I've never seen a storm-phobic dog lose its phobia,'' he\nsaid. ``If a dog likes birds, I can teach it to ignore gunshots,\nbecause it's focused on a bird. But if it doesn't like storms,\nthat's a lot deeper. I don't believe that a phobia can be changed.\nEver.\n\n   ``I tell owners to go for the drugs if you want to help a\nstorm-phobic dog. Its life will be much better. And if your dog is\nscared of loud noises, board it far away from the city during the\nFourth of July. You'll both be happier.''\nTips for frightened animals\nIn the face of fear, here's help Although some cats get anxious\nduring storms, the majority of family pets that are storm-phobic\nare dogs.\n\n   Here is a list of do's and don'ts for anxious owners trying to\nhelp, adapted from local pet experts:\n\n   _Don't be afraid to call your vet for help. Veterinarians have a\nwide assortment of drugs that can calm a nervous dog.\n\n   - During a storm do not give your dog praise or cuddle him when\nhe is afraid. That reinforces his behavior.
