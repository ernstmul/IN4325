The agency\nkeeps a cut and returns the rest of the money to police.\n\n   Police say some of that windfall is used to fight the war on\ndrugs. But such transfers to federal agencies hurt taxpayers, who\nmust pay more for schools. And they clearly violate state law.\n\n   ``The full intent (of the law) was to give that money to the\nschools, or most of it. They are not getting it,'' said state Rep.\nJim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and an early backer of the state law.\n\n   ``If the public knew this in a large scale, they would not like\nit.''\n\n   Federal officials and some local police say that the seizures of\nmoney are proper and that they've done nothing wrong.\n\n   Other law enforcement officials say they believe the law is not\nclear about every situation that police confront.\n\n   ``We are trying to determine who is right and who is wrong,''\nsaid Capt. James Keathley of the Missouri Highway Patrol, which\noften turns over money to federal agents.\n\n   Still other departments won't talk at all about the way they\nhandle federal forfeitures, which is the legal term for the process\nof taking money.\n\n   For example, Kansas City police said state law did not require\nthem to answer questions from the media.\n\n   But a federal appellate judge, in a written opinion filed in\n1998, said it was clear that the federal Drug Enforcement\nAdministration and the Missouri Highway Patrol had ``successfully\nconspired'' in one case to keep forfeited money.\n\n   That case led Judge James B. Loken of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court\nof Appeals in his opinion to question whether federal agencies were\n``using their extensive forfeiture powers to frustrate the fiscal\npolicy of States such as Missouri.'' The law's intent\n\n   The state's fiscal policy was designed to keep forfeiture money\nout of the hands of police to prevent a conflict of interest: When\npolice benefit directly from the money they seize, they might be\ntempted to conduct illegal searches to seize assets.\n\n   In fact, that's exactly what has happened across the country,\nwhere most states, including Kansas, generally allow police to keep\ndrug money they seize. Illegal searches and other abuses by police\ndepartments have been well-documented in recent years in such\nplaces as California, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.\n\n   ``I am not so concerned where the money goes as I am concerned\nwhere the money doesn't go,'' said Sen. Francis Flotron, a\nChesterfield Republican who helped write Missouri's forfeiture law.\n\n   ``I don't want to create a situation where police have an\nincentive to stop people for the benefit of getting stuff for their\nown departmental use.''\n\n   If the money goes to schools, it not only removes a temptation\nfrom police but also is put to good use, relieving a burden from\nschool taxpayers, lawmakers say.\n\n   So they set up a process. Police who seize money must report it\nto the county prosecutor, who along with a judge must decide\nwhether the money should be forfeited. The forfeited money is sent\nto schools or, in special cases, transferred to a federal agency.\n\n   But police have found a way to defeat lawmakers' wishes.\n\n   Their efforts to keep drug money have been no secret _\nlegislators tried to fight them off with tougher laws in 1993 _ yet\nthe police arrangement with federal agencies has been almost\ninvisible to the public.\n\n   That's no accident.\n\n   Police and federal agencies go to great lengths not to advertise\ntheir arrangement. In fact, all those contacted by The Kansas City\nStar refused to provide public records.\n\n   As a result, it's impossible to track how much money law\nenforcement has diverted from schools.\n\n   But The Star was able to glimpse the windfall for law\nenforcement by finding several police reports and court cases that\nshow how police and federal agencies work together.\n\n   In 14 cases in the Kansas City area in recent years, police and\nthe Highway Patrol seized more than $1.4 million and sent it to\nfederal agencies. In return, the federal agencies sent most of the\nmoney back to police and the Highway Patrol, usually keeping about\n20 percent of it for processing costs.\n\n   In each case, legal experts say, a state judge should have\ndecided where the money would go _ and that's usually to schools.\n\n   In one typical instance, Kansas City police stopped two men in\n1996 because their car did not have a front license plate. Officers\nsearched the car with a drug-sniffing dog and found a shoe box with\n$22,765 in the front seat, according to police reports. Neither man\nwas charged with a crime, and although they protested the seizure,\nthey gave up a challenge to it because of legal costs.\n\n   Police turned the money over to the DEA, which later returned\nmore than $18,000 to the department.\n\n   Those 14 cases indicate a pattern of conduct, one expert said.\n\n   ``Reasonable inferences could be drawn that this is an attempt\nto circumvent the state forfeiture laws to benefit the state\nagency,'' said Jimmy Gurule, a law professor at Notre Dame\nUniversity and co-author of a legal text on forfeitures.\n\n   A few figures suggest how broad the forfeiture diversion by law\nenforcement may be. MORE\n\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ to answer questions.\n\n   Stephen L. Hill, U.S. attorney for the Western District of\nMissouri, protests Loken's opinion.\n\n   ``We disagree with (Judge Loken's) observations both on when the\nseizure took place and that there was some kind of effort to\ncircumvent state law,'' Hill said.\n\n   A seizure doesn't occur just because police find the money, said\nFrances Reddis, an assistant U.S. attorney.\n\n   ``My analogy is, when does an arrest occur?'' Reddis said.\n``Police officers often stop people, question them and it is not\nconsidered an arrest until they can't leave.''\n\n   Gurule, the Notre Dame legal expert on forfeitures, strongly\ndisagreed. A seizure occurs when someone is stopped by police, he\nsaid.\n\n   ``To suggest that the seizure of the vehicle and its contents,\nthe money, occurred sometime later when the DEA arrived at the\nscene is ludicrous,'' Gurule said.\n\n   Black's Law Dictionary defines a seizure as occurring ``not only\nwhen an officer arrests an individual, but whenever he restrains\nthe individual's freedom to walk away.''\n\n   Despite Loken's opinion, Cole never got his money back _ he\nfiled his appeal of the forfeiture too late. Reform in the works\n\n   Public officials say they will press for reform on almost every\nfront:\n\n   - State law _ Kreider and other legislators say they will push\nfor new measures when the General Assembly's 1999 session begins\nthis week.\n\n   Some lawmakers would prohibit any drug money at all going to\nfederal agencies. Others suggest giving police an incentive to work\nwith the state by letting them keep 50 percent of forfeitures.\n\n   - Penalties _ Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat who\nwas just elected floor majority leader, said it might be necessary\nto enact penalties for law enforcement agencies that do not follow\nthe law.\n\n   ``Since there is no penalty clause, they can do whatever they\nwant to do,'' said DePasco, who also is a member of the Civil and\nCriminal Jurisprudence Committee. ``We'll probably have to put a\npenalty clause in there to put some teeth in the law.''\n\n   - State probe _ Some want the attorney general to investigate.\n\n   Nixon, however, has declined to comment on the issue.
