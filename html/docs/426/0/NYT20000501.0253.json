Now, in a trend that stresses communication, they encourage\nus to ``understand their minds'' and discover the depth and\nrichness possible in the human-animal relationship.\n\n   Of course, training remains a necessity: For their own safety,\ndogs must learn to sit, lie down, stay and come on request. They\nalso need to be taught to respect people and other pets so they can\nparticipate comfortably within the structures of our lives.\n\n   But training no longer requires a struggle for dominance. When\nyou have developed a rapport with a dog and established realistic\nexpectations, training becomes a lot more fun for both owner and\ndog.\n\n   ``We need to be predictable, but not rigid with our pets,'' says\nDr. Karen Overall, director of the Behavior Clinic at the\nVeterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in\nPhiladelphia. ``Why should we be so obsessed with walking our dogs\non a perfect heel? We ought to allow dogs some autonomy, to respect\ntheir inherent needs. Let them sniff the sidewalk. All that yanking\nand yelling just leads to problems.''\n\n   Janet Boss, owner of Best Friends Dog Obedience in Baltimore,\nMd., supports the trend toward relaxing strict obedience standards.\n``In the ideal situation,'' says Boss, ``we should be able to use\nour voice and our body to communicate with our dogs in order to\nshape their behavior without having to rely on clickers, treats,\nextreme jerking or yelling.\n\n   ``Dogs thrive on positive training,'' explains Boss. ``They like\nknowing the rules, and they want to please you. Humans must take\nthe role of leader, but being the 'boss' doesn't mean being an\nogre.''\n\n   Training a dog begins by delving into the workings of the canine\nmind. From the bevy of books currently available, select and read\nmore than one. Once you've sorted through some of the prevailing\ntheories and have developed an educated point of view, consider a\nclass.\n\n   Classes _ puppy kindergarten, basic obedience or the newer\ncompanion-dog classes _ can add depth and dimension to your\nnew-found insight. While executing the theories and practices\nyou've read about, you'll have a professional on hand to guide you,\npeers will encourage your progress and your dog will be interacting\nwith people and other dogs.\n\n   Observe a class before signing up. ``If they won't let you sit\nin,'' warns Boss, steer clear. Watch for any rough handling or\nhitting. Praise should be emphasized over correction, because\nsuccesses lead to good habits.''\n\n   Praise is an important element of any behavior modification.\nYou'll need to find the level that works best for your dog, so that\nthe dog is neither overstimulated (and loses focus) nor\nunderappreciated (and loses interest). If you can anticipate the\ndog's behavior, and praise encouragingly while manipulating and\nguiding it, rather than overcorrecting, you'll build that positive\nand most rewarding foundation for appropriate behavior and a strong\nbond.\n\n   While starting a class with a newly acquired puppy is the\ntraditional wisdom, older dogs can learn new tricks in a basic\nobedience or companion-dog class. ``We've had dogs that were 10\nyears old in our classes,'' says Boss, ``and today more and more\npeople are adopting 'secondhand dogs.'''\n\n   Some dogs respond to training more quickly and easily than\nothers. For many, progress in training is cumulative, moving in\nbits and pieces rather than in huge leaps _ a factor that often\nleads to impatience or frustration.\n\n   ``Every dog should have some kind of manners training, but if a\nclass isn't working, don't force it,'' advises Overall. Some dogs\njust aren't suited to certain settings. Many basic obedience or\ncompanion-dog classes are becoming more flexible and incorporating\nplaytime into the lessons.\n\n   Overall frequently advises dog owners to try agility classes,\nwhere dogs utilize the basics of obedience training while engaged\nin directed activities that will let them thrive and have fun. And\nBoss is introducing practical lessons into her puppy classes, such\nas ``polite walking'' (instead of formal heeling), sitting still\nfor vet exams and fetching as a positive outlet for all that puppy\nenergy.\n\n   However we decide to train our dogs, they are observing us all\nthe time. Everything we do with, or to, our dogs affects their\nattitude and behavior _ from the way we let them out in the morning\nto where they sleep at night.\n\n   Whether we look upon dogs as children, entertainers, equals or\nheroes, dogs expect and ardently desire for us to become their\nkindly leaders. Investigating and tapping into a dog's potential\ncan pay off in a long and rewarding relationship. But there's an\nextra benefit, too. ``Making an effort to understand the dog,''\nOverall believes, ``will make you into the kind of person your dog\nalready believes you to be.''\n\n     LEARNING BY THE BOOK     \n\n   Here are some books to get your understanding of dogs off on the\nright foot. ``Kinship with All Life'' (HarperSanFrancisco; 1954;\n$12), by J.
