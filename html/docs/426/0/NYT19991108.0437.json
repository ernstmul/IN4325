Times News Service   \n\n   PARIS _ The young woman in the White Sox cap would give her name\nonly as Sophie. Her golden lab would go by Mellis. No last names,\nplease.\n\n   Mellis, luckily for her, was too excited by all the attention to\ncommit the crime the two had in mind.\n\n   Their mistake was to stroll down the Passage des Marais, a quiet\npedestrian alley, just as an anti-dog-poop demonstration was at its\nheight. The demonstrators drew chalk circles around the piles, sang\nanti-doggie ditties, and repelled dog owners by offering them\nchocolate versions of what they had planned to leave.\n\n   Since there were as many journalists as demonstrators about, the\ntwo ladies were quickly mobbed. ``Not everyone in Paris is dirty,''\npleaded Sophie. ``But it's difficult for Mellis to go between two\ncars. We need someplace especially for dogs.''\n\n   How about, she was asked, just picking it up, as the citizens of\nother great metropolises do? ``Oh, well _ maybe if the city\nprovided plastic bags,'' she said, unenthusiastically. ``And\nperhaps the city could teach the correct way to use them.''\n\n   As always in Paris, it is the government's fault.\n\n   Dog waste, says Le Figaro, ``sticks to Paris' reputation the way\nfog does to London's.'' Tourists are revolted at what they find\nunderfoot as they gaze overhead. An average of 650 people a year\nbreak bones or are hospitalized after slipping in it.\n\n   In a Harris poll of neighborhood cleanliness, 94 percent of\nParisians polled said they considered it the most offensive aspect\nof public litter. It is amazing that it has never been named as a\nsecret factor in Princess Diana's death.\n\n   Now, as it has done periodically, the city is trying to do\nsomething about the problem. It has begun a poster and movie-short\ncampaign hoping to awaken the average Parisian's sense of guilt.\n\n   The best-known movie short follows a blind man cheerfully\nnavigating city streets. When he gets home and hangs up his white\ncane, the camera lingers nauseatingly on what he has speared en\nbrochette. One poster shows a person in a wheelchair who has just\nrun through a pile and is about to put her hand in the mess on her\nwheel. A third shows a boy playing in the grass with filth-covered\ntoys.\n\n   ``You're right not to pick it up,'' the campaign motto says to\ndog owners. ``They do it very well for you.''\n\n   Frankly, since the campaign began Sept. 30, there has been no\nrush by apologetic Parisians to mend their ways.\n\n   The city calculates that its 200,000 resident dogs deposit 16\ntons of waste a day, of which the city cleans up 12 tons, at a cost\nthat works out to about a dollar a pound. Much of the work is done\nby 70 green ``caninette'' motorcycles with vacuum cleaners\nattached, but that is too few, and some are sidelined in a contract\ndispute.\n\n   The city _ in the person of Patrick Tremege, adjunct mayor for\nenvironmental matters and the force behind the ad campaign _ knows\nperfectly well that asking politely is not enough.\n\n   Tremege has the experience to understand that the stick works\nbetter than the doggie treat. In 1974, as a 21-year-old student, he\nleft the island of Madagascar, a French colony where his parents\nowned whole fields of fragrant ylang-ylang perfume-oil trees.\nWithout even a stop in Paris, he flew to New York to take an\ninternship. There, he became a dog walker for diplomats _ three\nmutts four times a day, up and down First Avenue in front of the\nUnited Nations.\n\n   He fondly remembers the long, clean, effective American\npooper-scoop he owned back then. He says he has filled his office\nhere with French engineers trying to re-create the design.\n(France's New York consulate has been unable to find its equal, he\nswears.)\n\n   He also remembers the night he got lazy. ``It was 8 p.m., it was\nwinter, it was dark,'' he said. ``One of the dogs did it, and this\npolice car turned around, and put on its lights. Woo-woo! You don't\nknow Madagascar, but I'd never seen a police car with a siren, and\nI was terrified. I just liquefied.\n\n   ``I was convinced they were going to shoot me. I don't even know\nwhat the policeman said _ I didn't have much English and I was\nwatching his hands to see if he would go for his gun. In the end,\nhe could see I was a foreigner paralyzed by fear, and he let me\ngo.''\n\n   Fearful is more or less how he wants Parisians to feel. But even\nhe, an adjunct mayor, says it is the government's fault.\n\n   In this case, he explains, it is because Paris is the national\ncapital, and the mayor has no real control over the police,\ntraffic, parking, or public sanitation. The national police are\nlegally responsible, ``but French police have a very high idea of\nwhat their duties are, and they think this is beneath them,'' he\ncomplained. ``They give out only six tickets a year.''\n\n   Even worse, local law only requires dog owners to urge their\ndogs into the gutter, not to pick up after them. Parisians also\nroutinely ignore the leash law, allowing them to use the old\n``My-goodness-whose-bad-dog-is-doing-that-way-over-there?'' trick.\n\n   Frustrated, Tremege shifted 50 of his park custodians to dog\npatrol.\n\n   But Benoit Pastisson, an organizer of the Passage des Marais\ndemonstration, complains that even those 50 lonely and resented\nsouls work 9 to 5 while dog owners creep the streets before dawn\nand after the late movie.\n\n   Tremege says the real problem is that his men have no legal\npower to demand identification or make arrests. ``Some people don't\nknow that, because they handed out 900 tickets this year,'' he\nsaid. ``But if you say `no,' there's nothing they can do.''\n\n   Why, the two men were asked, are Parisians so uncooperative\nabout this? Pastisson answers with a shocking lack of jingoism:\n``Anglo-Saxons are more civilized people _ just look at how they\nwait at traffic lights.''\n\n   Tremege throws up his hands. In Paris, there are more old people\nliving with dogs per capita than in any other big city, he said\n(and they vote, which is why the law is so lax). Beyond that, ``How\ncan I explain?'' he said. ``French people are made in such a way so\nthat seeing it in the street is not as shocking as it is to you.''\n\n   Next year, he said, he will ask Parliament to give his park\nworkers the power to arrest.
