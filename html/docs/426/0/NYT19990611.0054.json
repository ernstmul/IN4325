Monica\nLewinsky is a lot younger than Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones and\nsome of the others we know about.''\n\n   ``I'm not talking about his sex life,'' I explained. ``What\npuzzles me is how he switched from being a Vietnam draft dodger and\nwar protester into a president who drops bombs and shoots missiles\nall over the world.''\n\n   ``I think it's because he's really an actor,'' she said. ``He\nprobably thinks he's George C. Scott playing General Patton.''\n\n   ``I guess he'd rather go down in history as Bomber Bill than a\nnear child molester,'' I said. ``I just wish he'd be more like\nTeddy Roosevelt. Ol' TR went straight up San Juan Hill with his\ntroops. Clinton could at least ride along on one of his Stealth\nbomber missions. It would make a great photo op, and he'd be safer\nthan being home in bed with Hillary.''\n\n   ``If we didn't have guns we wouldn't have all these people being\nkilled,'' my wife protested.\n\n   ``You may be right,'' I admitted, ``but there are constitutional\nissues about individual rights to consider.''\n\n   ``Do dogs have constitutional rights?'' she asked.\n\n   ``I'm not sure,'' I admitted. ``I wouldn't think so, but trees\nand snail darters seem to, so I guess it's possible. Why are you\nasking about dogs?''\n\n   ``Didn't you read the story about the Fayette County\nCommission?''\n\n   ``No,'' I answered. ``What have they done now?''\n\n   ``They've made it illegal to have more than three dogs. The\nstory says one lady is eight dogs over the limit. She hired a\nlawyer to try to keep her dogs.''\n\n   ``So what happens if you have more than three dogs?''\n\n   ``I guess you go to jail, unless you open a kennel.''\n\n   ``How do you open a kennel?''\n\n   ``It says here you have to have runs and shelters and be at\nleast 300 feet from neighboring residential property.''\n\n   ``It's a good thing Lassie didn't come from a big family and\nlive in Fayette County,'' I said. ``She'd have ended up in the\npound instead of in the movies.''\n\n   ``Sounds like a good law to me,'' she said. ``We shouldn't be\nfeeding so many dogs when children in Africa are starving to\ndeath.''\n\n   ``That's a good point,'' I admitted, ``but it sounds\nunconstitutional. What if the commissioners decide we can have only\ntwo dogs, or one dog, or no dogs? How about parakeets and goldfish?\nThere are some things the government just shouldn't control.''\n\n   ``Well, it happens,'' she said. ``Don't you remember when we\nwere in China last year? The government won't let Chinese couples\nhave more than one child, unless they're farmers and need the\nhelp.''\n\n   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``But China is a communist dictatorship.\nWe're supposed to be a democracy. Besides, the Fayette County dog\nlaw is obviously prejudicial, unfair, and discriminatory.''\n\n   ``How do you mean?'' she asked.\n\n   ``What about cats? People can have as many cats as they want,\nbut only three dogs. That's discrimination if I ever heard of it.\nIt's ridiculous! Everybody knows a dog is man's best friend. Cats\nhold humans in contempt, show no gratitude, don't recognize their\nown names, bite and scratch benefactors, and sometimes smother\nnewborn babies. If we're going to have a limit on dogs we darn sure\nneed a limit on cats!''\n\n   ``Maybe the commissioners will make up some new laws about\ncats,'' she suggested.\n\n   I pointed out that every time politicians and bureaucrats make\nup new laws we lose individual rights. In Fayette County I don't\nthink you can build a birdhouse without several complicated\npermits.\n\n   ``That's strange,'' she said. ``Aren't all the people in charge\nRepublicans? And don't Republicans stand for individual rights?''\n\n   ``Not any more,'' I said. ``Barry Goldwater's dead. Everybody\nhas switched roles. Bill Clinton acts like Teddy Roosevelt and\nRepublicans love Big Government as much as the Democrats.\n\n   ``Then maybe when they finish with dogs they'll do something\nabout cars,'' she said.\n\n   ``Do what about cars?''\n\n   ``Don't you read the newspapers?'' she said. ``We've got so many\ncars nobody can get anywhere on time and we can't breathe because\nof the pollution. Why can't the commissioners make people cut down\non cars while they're getting rid of their dogs?''\n\n   ``That's a good idea,'' I agreed. ``Or, they could eliminate\ndrivers. Remember when we were in China they told us the government\nmakes people stop driving when they reach age 55?''\n\n   ``China seems to have a lot of good ideas,'' she said.\n\n   ``Yes.'' I agreed. ``And we've worked out a nice trade\narrangement. They steal our military secrets and we steal their\nrules.''\n\n   Jim Minter is a former editor of The Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I was at my end of the breakfast table\nwith the morning paper, trying to catch up on whose embassy and\nwhat hospital had been bombed in Belgrade.\n","\n   ``It's amazing how people change,'' I remarked. ``Bill Clinton\ncertainly has done a 180.''\n","\n   ``I don't think he's changed all that much,'' my wife objected.\n``The only difference I can see is that, while he was a womanizer\nin Arkansas, he's been more of a girlizer in Washington.
