About a\ndozen law schools offer classes in animal law, including the\nUniversity of Vermont, Georgetown University, and the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles.\n\n   ``Student interest in this subject has brought it to the\nforefront of our attention,'' said Alan Ray, assistant dean for\nacademic affairs at Harvard Law School. ``The scholarship in this\narea has been growing in the last few years and students took an\nactive role in researching background on faculty.''\n\n   The students starting Wise's class are not in for an effortless\nelective, either.\n\n   The 49-year-old professor, who has taught animal law at Vermont\nLaw School and Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine, has prepared an\neight-page syllabus that will compel students to consider\neverything from what it means to be an animal to why humans deserve\nmoral rights while ``non-human'' animals don't.\n\n   Wise, a former president of the Animal Legal Defense Fund who\npublished last month ``Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for\nAnimals,'' will also take his students through the mounting animal\ncase law, which include recent court victories such as a federal\nappeals court decision in 1998 to give a zoo visitor the right to\nsue so chimpanzees are not left alone in a cage.\n\n   Rummaging through stacks of journal and newspaper articles in\nhis book-lined basement, as his cat, Alice, paws across his\nshoulders, Wise explains how he plans to persuade courts to bolster\nanimal rights.\n\n   Before pushing the boundary with dolphins, dogs and cats, he\nhopes courts will accept his arguments that chimpanzees should have\nrights to bodily integrity and liberty, meaning it would violate\nthe law to restrict their movement or conduct tests on primates.\n\n   Eventually, he hopes courts will ban such practices as required\neuthanasia for dogs biting people and other severe reprisals\nagainst wayward pets.\n\n   ``These are not trifling issues,'' he said. ``People care about\nanimals.
