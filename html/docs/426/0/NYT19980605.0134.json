Got a yen to play\nFrisbee on the beach with a high-jumping hound? Or jog in the park\nwith a glad-to-be-with-you canine?\n\n   Camp Happy Dog's Rent-A-Dog program may be just the answer.\n\n   Actually, the program _ which offers all-day and all-night\nvisits with abused and abandoned dogs who have been rescued and are\nbeing resocialized for adoption _ is misnamed. There's no rental\ninvolved, no fee for taking a dog out.\n\n   Would-be dog-sitters just have to convince animal rescuer June\nRoberts they're ``responsible and dog-smart.''\n\n   ``The nicest thing somebody could do is to come by and pick up a\ndog who's been here a long time and take it to the dog park or take\nit to the beach,'' said Roberts, a Studio City screenwriter who\nheads the nonprofit Neva Foundation, which finds new homes for\nabandoned and abused dogs.\n\n   ``Some people have them sleep over, some take them to barbecues\nwhere they can socialize with people.''\n\n   The 5-month-old enterprise was the brainchild of Roberts and\nCamp Happy Dog owners Deborah Nabb and Nick Deleo. Nabb and Deleo\nhad opened their Sherman Oaks day-care center for dogs about five\nmonths earlier and had begun to look for ways to become involved in\npet rescue efforts.\n\n   That was about the same time Roberts was looking for a place to\nsocialize and showcase dogs up for adoption.\n\n   Together, they came up with the idea for the Rent-A-Dog program.\n\n   Roberts brings two to six Neva dogs _ many of them roly-poly\npuppies _ to Camp Happy Dog every day. People who ``rent'' a dog\nfor a day include those who are thinking about owning a dog but\nneed some convincing, people actively looking for a dog to adopt or\njust dog lovers who don't live in a place where they can have a dog\n``and need a dog fix once in awhile,'' Roberts said.\n\n   Since the Rent-A-Dog program began, more than a dozen Neva dogs\nhave found new homes, either with people who've ``rented'' them for\nthe day, their friends or dog owners who've seen the dogs when they\ncome to pick up their own pooches from day care.\n\n   Most of the dogs the Neva Foundation rescues come from dire\nsituations and are fortunate to find good homes.\n\n   ``We get most of our dogs from dumpsters _ sometimes only 2 or 3\nhours old. People just throw them away,'' Roberts said. ``And a lot\nof people just move and leave the dog locked in the garden.\nSometimes it's a month before a Realtor finds them, and by then\nthey're not even ambulatory. It takes months to nurse them back to\nhealth.''\n\n   A typical success story involves a golden retriever puppy who\nhad been badly abused. He played during the day with the camp dogs\nand went home at night with one of the trainers. ``He was so shy,\nso scared,'' Roberts said. ``One week later, he was adopted into a\nreally loving home with three cats.''\n\n   Tyrone, a fuzzy-faced abandoned pup with a Benji-like appeal,\nimmediately caught Nabb's eye. She called her friend, Dana Weinberg\nof Encino, and urged her to adopt the little fellow _ even though\nWeinberg wasn't sure she wanted to take in a second dog.\n\n   ``She walked in the door and said, `He's perfect','' Nabb said.\n``Tyrone had a home.''\n\n   ``There are just too many dogs that don't have homes and that\nare going to be put to sleep,'' Weinberg said, rubbing Tyrone's\nbelly. ``I couldn't imagine this one not having a life. Now, I go\nhome and my kids are screaming and yelling, but the dogs are\nlicking me and loving me. It's unconditional love _ and it's\ngreat.''\n\n   If there's a major success story to come out of the adoption\nprogram, it's Sam, a mixed-breed dog with ears like a donkey's. His\nowner moved and gave Sam up; it took six months to find him a new\nowner.\n\n   ``We thought he'd need lots of room to run around, but his new\nowner has a 58-foot trimaran,'' Deleo said. ``Sam stands on the\nfront with the wind in his face, and he's a happy dog. Sam is a\nsailor, and life is good.\n\n   ``The important thing we learned from that is there is a dog for\nevery person and a person for every dog.''!end!  \n","Headline":"\nRENT-A-DOG HELPS LICK PET-ADOPTION PROBLEM\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Want to meet that cute bachelor in the next\nbuilding who walks his bulldog in the morning?
