Last\nmonth, The Kansas City Star published a series of stories showing\nthat police across the country evade state laws with the help of\nfederal agencies to keep millions of dollars in drug money.\n\n   To prevent a conflict of interest, many states have laws that\nprohibit police from directly profiting from crime-fighting. In\nMissouri, the constitution generally requires the money to go to\neducation.\n\n   But The Star found that, instead of following state laws, police\noften hand off drug money they seize to a federal law enforcement\nagency that then returns a portion, usually 80 percent, to police.\n\n   This week state Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, sent\na letter to the police board asking that it fully support a bill he\nis sponsoring. The bill would force Missouri police to follow state\nforfeiture laws.\n\n   During Thursday's special meeting of the Board of Police\nCommissioners, the three members who attended _ Mulvihill, Stacey\nDaniels and Dennis Eckold _ voted unanimously to adopt a policy\nbased on Wiggins' bill. A written policy will be presented to the\nboard Tuesday.\n\n   Wiggins was delighted when contacted later.\n\n   ``The police commissioners have shown the state how to represent\nlaw enforcement and how to represent the public,'' Wiggins said.\n``This is magnificent.''\n\n   State Sen. Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat who attended\nthe meeting, said the support of Kansas City police would help the\nbill in the next legislative session.\n\n   ``It is the right thing to do instead of waiting for it to pass\nuntil February next year,'' said DePasco, majority floor leader.\n\n   DePasco said he hoped other agencies around the state would\nfollow. But he said rural law enforcement has been stubborn about\nthe legislation.\n\n   ``(They) are opposed to giving the money to the school\ndistricts,'' DePasco said.\n\n   Mulvihill, who proposed the policy, estimated that Kansas City\npolice have been receiving $1 million a year in forfeiture money.\n\n   ``With a $120 million budget, it doesn't seem like this million\ndollars is worth all this adverse publicity,'' Mulvihill said. ``I\nthink we should quit this questionable policy.''\n\n   Last week the board also came under fire when the attorney\ngeneral filed his lawsuit involving the $3.5 million.\n\n   The lawsuit stems from a story The Star published in 1996 about\nthe money. In 1997, the department filed a friendly lawsuit asking\na judge to decide where the money was to go. But in March of this\nyear, Dale Close, the department's attorney, asked that the lawsuit\nbe dismissed.\n\n   When Nixon filed a new lawsuit based on the money, it caught\npolice board commissioners by surprise even though Nixon had sent a\nletter to Eckold, the board president, and faxed a letter to Close\nalmost two weeks before the lawsuit was filed.
