Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The White House said on Monday that it would\npropose legislation to set legal requirements for surveillance in\ncyberspace by law enforcement authorities similar in some ways to\nthose for telephone wiretaps.\n\n   Privacy advocates and civil liberties groups welcomed some\naspects of the proposal but said they remained alarmed about a new\nFBI computer system that searches and intercepts private e-mail and\ncan easily capture communications of people not suspected of\ncrimes.\n\n   The legislative proposal was made as the administration also\nannounced on Monday that it had eased export controls on encryption\ntechnology, making it significantly easier for American companies\nto sell software products to the European Union and eight other\ntrading partners that can be used to keep computer data and\ncommunications secure.\n\n   Both the electronic surveillance proposal and the export control\nchanges are part of a broader policy outlined in a speech on Monday\nby John Podesta, the White House chief of staff. He said the policy\nattempts to balance the privacy rights of computer users against\nthe needs of law enforcement to be able to monitor digital\ncommunications.\n\n   Congress and federal regulators have done little work in the\narea, even as the world has quickly come to rely heavily on\ncommunications through cyberspace. More than 1.4 billion e-mails\nnow change hands every day.\n\n   The administration's legislative proposal on electronic\nsurveillance attempts to fix the inconsistent patchwork of laws\nthat apply different standards to telephone, cable and other\ntechnologies with a single standard for those systems and the\nInternet. Until now, law enforcement agencies have been able to\nmonitor electronic communication with only modest court\nsupervision.\n\n   The proposed legislation would require that the same standards\nthat apply to the interception of the content of telephone calls\napply to the interception of e-mail. Specifically, it would require\nlaw enforcement agents to demonstrate that they have probable cause\nof a crime in order to obtain a court order seeking the contents of\na suspect's e-mail.\n\n   The proposal would also give federal magistrates greater\nauthority to review requests by law enforcement authorities for\nso-called pen registers _ lists of the phone numbers called from a\nparticular location and the time of the calls. The magistrates now\nhave no authority to question the request for such lists, which are\nfrequently used by the authorities.\n\n   In the context of the Internet, existing laws are ambiguous\nabout what standards apply for different kinds of surveillance.\nMany limitations imposed on law enforcement in the context of\ntelephone wiretaps _ such as the requirement that such taps be\napproved at the highest level of the Justice Department _ do not\nappear to apply to e-mail surveillance.\n\n   Moreover, the Cable Act of 1984 sets a far harder burden for\ngovernment agents to satisfy when attempting to monitor computers\nusing cable modems than when monitoring telephones.
