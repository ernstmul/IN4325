Times News Service   \n\n   BERLIN _ With a German husband, 13 years in Germany and three\nchildren born here, Stacy Wiedenmann of Chicago thought she had a\nfair grasp of her adoptive land. But that was before Cora stepped\ninto her life.\n\n   Cora is a mid-size black mongrel that scarcely advertises her\npower to metamorphose a life. But take her out onto the leafy\nstreets of Berlin and the effect on people is dramatic: German\nreserve abruptly gives way to Neapolitan gregariousness.\n\n   How sweet, the passersby coo as they coddle Cora, how simply\nlovely. When did you get her? Where? Is she already house-trained?\nWell, isn't that something! How about meeting to walk our dogs and\ncompare notes?\n\n   Wiedenmann, 39, is in a state of shock. She had one child, then\nanother, then a third, walked with them in her neighborhood and\nnobody ever said a word. No candy was offered, no hair ruffled, no\nage asked, no tenderness displayed. The children seemed as\ninvisible as Cora seems conspicuous.\n\n   ``It's amazing; everyone suddenly talks to me,'' said\nWiedenmann, who acquired Cora a few weeks ago. ``Perhaps Germans\nlike dogs more than kids; certainly they talk to you through dogs.\nI think they feel more comfortable because a child is personal,\nperhaps too personal. So a dog becomes the ideal passport to social\ncontact.''\n\n   This is a formal country, full of regulations governing\neverything from times of day when children are supposed to be quiet\nto the lace curtains to be placed on certain windows. But dogs defy\nGermanic rules _ unleashing passions, unbuttoning the standoffish,\nunveiling a charged universe of canine chaos.\n\n   So charged that Otto Schily, the interior minister, recently\nspent two days locked in dog discussions with his counterparts in\nGermany's 16 states. Newspapers were full of images of raging pit\nbulls and hideous dog-bite wounds as the ministers debated what to\ndo about the growing number of so-called Kampfhunde, or attack\ndogs.\n\n   Even the weighty weekly Die Zeit joined the fray with a\nprominent article offering the view that, ``If nuclear power\nstations in this country had caused as many dead and injured people\nas attack dogs, they would all have been shut down a long time\nago.''\n\n   When Berlin's interior minister proposed a ban on Kampfhunde,\nthe owners of such dogs called for a demonstration at which their\npets would wear a Star of David meant to symbolize what they\nclaimed was Hitler's comparable hounding of Jews. After protests\nfrom the Jewish organizations, an apology was offered and the idea\nwithdrawn.\n\n   Such was the general brouhaha that the ministers were unable to\nreach any firm decisions. In a statement last month, they noted the\nimportance of appropriate training, suggested that the aggressivity\nof a particular breed was not easy to assess, and left states to\ndetermine whether certain dogs deemed dangerous should be banned,\nheavily taxed, or made available only with special licenses.\n\n   In effect, nothing changed. With approximately 200,000 dogs in\nBerlin, perhaps 14,000 of them attack dogs, and an estimated 50,000\npeople a year getting bitten by dogs in Germany, tensions between\ndog owners and their opponents continue to run high.\n\n   ``The German dog lobby is like the Miami Cuban lobby _ nobody\ncan touch it,'' said Peter Schneider, a Berlin author distressed by\nthe ministers' indecision and this city's proliferation of dogs.\n(The Berlin police reported 2,600 bites in the city last year,\ncompared with 1,750 in 1998.)\n\n   ``The dog is so close to the German soul that not even an\nestimated 20 tons of dog excrement a day, much of it on the street,\nproduces an official response.''\n\n   It is true that while in general Germans see their role as not\nonly obeying laws but also enforcing them _ denouncing a car\nillegally parked or a branch illegally cut from a protected tree _\nthey display no similar zeal for reporting canine infractions like\nsoiling city streets to the police. At once objects of love and\ncomplete control, dogs thrive here.\n\n   In an essay called ``Of Dogs and Germans,'' inspired a decade\nago by an outburst of national soul-searching over what to do with\nthe 5,000 dogs that had guarded the Berlin Wall and were marooned\nby its fall, Schneider concluded that a German without a German\nshepherd was incomplete and that the German capacity to empathize\nwith a dog's suffering was boundless.\n\n   ``When Adolf Hitler was so disappointed with his Germans that he\nshot himself inside his bunker, he not only left his people without\ntheir Fuehrer, but a German shepherd without its master _ an event\nthat inspired Guenter Grass to write a 700-page novel entitled `Dog\nYears,''' he noted.\n\n   Wiedenmann's dog years have just begun; to keep them calm she\nhas enrolled Cora at Pro Dog.\n\n   Courses at Pro Dog, an obedience school for mutts and pedigrees\nalike, include seminars on dog psychology, leash technique and\nhuman-canine communication. Training is also offered in\n``high-stress dog situations,'' such as riding the subway and\ntaking your dog shopping or to a restaurant, all popular practices\nhere.\n\n   The 10-week courses are of a kind widely followed in a country\nwhere dog discipline is taken seriously and woods echo to the\ncome-hither cry of ``Platz!'' The courses lead to a qualification\ncalled Hundefuehrerschein I, a sort of dog degree.\n\n   An advanced degree, comparable to a dog doctorate and known as\nHundefuehrerschein II, involves advanced canine concepts such as\nmanaging your dog without a leash. It can be had with another 10\nweeks of study under Renate Albrecht, the animal psychologist in\ncharge.\n\n   ``There is no such thing as a bad breed of dog, only bad and\nignorant dog owners,'' contended Albrecht, who trained in\nSwitzerland. ``All this talk about attack dogs is rubbish meant to\ngenerate mass hysteria and pressure politicians to do something.\nThe only thing required is that people learn how to look after\ntheir dogs.''\n\n   nn\n\n   To illustrate her point, Albrecht has five dogs _ Charlotte,\nAmanda, Archibald, Goofy and Bandit _ four of which are\nmastiff-like dogues de Bordeaux that are officially classified as\nKampfhunde.

Apologizing\nfor the smell, Albrecht explained that a dog is not a human.\n\n   It is enough to squeeze a dog's nose to convey displeasure,\nAlbrecht noted. She squeezed Amanda's amorphous nose to show what\nshe meant; Amanda acquiesced. ``You see how good she is,'' Albrecht\nsaid.\n\n   But not everybody sees that goodness. ``People regularly come up\nto me when I am walking my dogs and say the dogs should be\ngassed,'' Albrecht said. ``Can you imagine?
