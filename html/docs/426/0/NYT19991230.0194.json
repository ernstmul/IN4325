Keith Bridges of the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said investigators have\nbeen tracking dead-end tips about threats of violence ``but our\nbiggest concern is the crowds and drinking.''\n\n   In response, police have set up remote booking areas. ``If they\nwant to be drunk and disruptive, sadly for them they will wake up\nin a new millennium behind bars.''\n\n   In contrast to the Southern scene, police in New York were\npulling out all stops to guard against terrorism before the New\nYear's ball drops in Times Square. Officials have ordered that area\nbe stripped of wastebaskets and parked cars and that manhole covers\nbe welded shut.\n\n   In the South, perhaps the most drastic security measures are\nbeing taken in Florida, where revelers will pass through metal\ndetectors to attend concerts by Blondie and the Gipsy Kings on\nMiami Beach.\n\n   But Phil Ramer with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement\nsaid the state expects a relatively tranquil millennium passage, in\npart because its law enforcement officers are veterans at handling\nboth international visitors and big-time crime.\n\n   ``Florida is used to drugs being smuggled for years, so our\n(U.S.) Customs operations are tighter,'' he said. Ports of entry\nare posted with dogs trained at sniffing out explosives and drugs.\nFlorida's international flights are limited mostly to Orlando and\nMiami where security is extremely tight.\n\n   And if you're a tourist headed to the theme parks, Ramer says\nyou'll find model, futuristic security at Disney World, where the\ndoors will be closed behind visitors at 10 a.m. today. After that,\nRamer said, ``They'll let you out, but they're not letting anybody\nelse in.''\n\n   ``They have so much security there,'' Ramer said. ``Have you\never wondered why there's no trash in the containers at Disney\nWorld? It's because it's sucked right up. There's a whole city\nunder Disney World where the employees go back and forth to work.''\n\n   FBI agents in Alabama are among those across the nation on alert\nfor domestic terrorism activity.\n\n   ``We have two basic groups we're looking at, the radical\nreligious and the militias,'' said Ernfeld of the Mobile office.\n\n   The FBI there has established contact with every police chief,\nsheriff and emergency management agency via telephone or radio, he\nsaid. A command center was launched Wednesday that is scheduled to\noperate until Jan. 5 and telephone numbers will be available for\nany possible problem.\n\n   ``We're ready for anything biological, chemical, radiological or\nsomebody getting to a power substation, and we will be able to\nminimize the response time,'' Emfeld said. ``If your VCR keeps\nblinking midnight, we even have a number for that.''\n\n   Kathy Scruggs writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Around the South, law enforcement officials say they\nwill remain vigilant for would-be terrorists through the New Year's\nweekend but admit they are breathing easier than their colleagues\nguarding against violence at extravanganzas in New York and\nWashington.\n","\n   They say they are worried much less about international\nterrorism than about some white supremacist setting off a ``bubba\nbomb'' for attention, but even the anti-government separatists\napparently are hunkering down against possible Y2K breakdowns and\npandemonium.\n","\n   ``These are the people who believe their power will fail, their\nwater won't run or they won't be able to get money out of their\nATM,'' said Bill Emfeld, special agent in charge of the FBI office\nin Mobile, Ala., that serves 36 Alabama counties, including the\ncapital of Montgomery. ``They're worried that we'll get U.N. troops\nto come in to restore order.''\n","\n   Added Joe Roy, director of the Intelligence Project of the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center, which monitors Web sites of hate\ngroups, ``It's relatively quiet out there in cyberspace, but you\nnever know which individual might fall off the grid.''\n","\n   More typical of police worries are those in Charlotte, N.C.,\nwhere for the first time the Uptown Downtown Countdown celebration\nwill include alcohol on the town square.
