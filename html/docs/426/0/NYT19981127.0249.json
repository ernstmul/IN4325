This has been indicated where\nappropriate.)  \n (bl)  \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Following are President Clinton's answers to the 81\nquestions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee as part of\nits impeachment investigation, as made public Friday by the White\nHouse:\n\n   Set forth below are answers to the questions that you have asked\nme.\n\n   I would like to repeat, at the outset, something that I have\nsaid before about my approach to these proceedings. I have asked my\nattorneys to participate actively, but the fact that there is a\nlegal defense to the various allegations cannot obscure the hard\ntruth, as I have said repeatedly, that my conduct was wrong. It was\nalso wrong to mislead people about what happened, and I deeply\nregret that.\n\n   For me, this long ago ceased to be primarily a legal or\npolitical issue and became instead a painful personal one,\ndemanding atonement and daily work toward reconciliation and\nrestoration of trust with my family, my friends, my Administration\nand the American people. I hope these answers will contribute to a\nspeedy and fair resolution of this matter.\n\n   1. Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law-enforcement\nofficer of the United States of America?\n\n   Response to Request No. 1:\n\n   The President is frequently referred to as the chief\nlaw-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution\nspecifically designates the President as such. Article II, Section\n1 of the United States Constitution states that ``(t)he executive\npower shall be vested in a President of the United States of\nAmerica,'' and the law-enforcement function is a component of the\nexecutive power.\n\n   2. Do you admit or deny that upon taking your oath of office\nthat you swore you would faithfully execute the office of President\nof the United States, and would to the best of your ability,\npreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States?\n\n   Response to Request No. 2:\n\n   At my Inaugurations in 1993 and 1997, I took the following oath:\n``I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of\nPresident of the United States, and will to the best of my ability,\npreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United\nStates.''\n\n   3. Do you admit or deny that, pursuant to Article II, Section 2\nof the Constitution, you have a duty to ``take care that the laws\nbe faithfully executed?''\n\n   Response to Request No. 3:\n\n   Article II, Section 3 (not Section 2), of the Constitution\nstates that the President ``shall take care that the Laws be\nfaithfully executed,'' and that is a Presidential obligation.\n\n   4. Do you admit or deny that you are a member of the bar and\nofficer of the court of a state of the United States, subject to\nthe rules of professional responsibility and ethics applicable to\nthe bar of that state?\n\n   Response to Request No. 4:\n\n   I have an active license to practice law (inactive for\ncontinuing legal education purposes) issued by the Supreme Court of\nArkansas. The license, No. 73017, was issued in 1973.\n\n   5. Do you admit or deny that you took an oath in which you swore\nor affirmed to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth, in a deposition conducted as part of a judicial proceeding\nin the case of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998?\n\n   Response to Request No. 5:\n\n   I took an oath to tell the truth on January 17, 1998, before my\ndeposition in the Jones v. Clinton case. While I do not recall the\nprecise wording of that oath, as I previously stated in my grand\njury testimony on August 17, 1998, in taking the oath ``I believed\nthen that I had to answer the questions truthfully.''\n\n   6. Do you admit or deny that you took an oath in which you swore\nor affirmed to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth, before a grand jury empanelled as part of a judicial\nproceeding by the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia Circuit on August 17, 1998?\n\n   Response to Request No. 6:\n\n   As the August 17, 1998, videotape reflects, I was asked ``Do you\nsolemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this\nmatter will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\ntruth, so help you God?,'' and I answered, ``I do.''\n\n   7. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 7, 1997, you\nreceived a letter composed by Monica Lewinsky in which she\nexpressed dissatisfaction with her search for a job in New York?\n\n   Response to Request No. 7:\n\n   At some point I learned of Ms. Lewinsky's decision to seek\nsuitable employment in New York. I do not recall receiving a letter\nin which she expressed dissatisfaction about her New York job\nsearch. I understand Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she sent a note\nindicating her decision to seek employment in New York, but I do\nnot believe she has said the note expressed dissatisfaction about\nher search for a job there. App. at 822-23 (grand jury testimony of\nMs. Lewinsky).\n\n   8. Do you admit or deny that you telephoned Monica Lewinsky\nearly in the morning on October 10, 1997, and offered to assist her\nin finding a job in New York?\n\n   Response to Request No. 8:\n\n   I understand that Ms. Lewinsky testified that I called her on\nthe 9th of October, 1997. App. at 823 (grand jury testimony of Ms.\nLewinsky). I do not recall that particular telephone call.\n\n   9. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997, you\nmet with Monica Lewinsky in or about the Oval Office dining room?\n\n   10. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997,\nMonica Lewinsky furnished to you, in or about the Oval Office\ndining room, a list of jobs in New York in which she was\ninterested?\n\n   11. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997, you\nsuggested to Monica Lewinsky that Vernon Jordan may be able to\nassist her in her job search?\n\n   12. Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997,\nafter meeting with Monica Lewinsky and discussing her search for a\njob in New York, you telephoned Vernon Jordan?\n\n   nn\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 9. 10, 11 and 12:\n\n   At some point, Ms. Lewinsky either discussed with me or gave me\na list of the kinds of jobs she was interested in, although I do\nnot know whether it was on Saturday, October 11, 1997. Records\nincluded in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that Ms. Lewinsky visited\nthe White House on October 11, 1997, and I may have seen her on\nthat day.\n\n   I do not believe I suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Jordan\nmight be able to assist her in her job search, and I understand\nthat Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she asked me if Mr. Jordan could\nassist her in finding a job in New York.\n\n   I speak to Mr. Jordan often, and I understand that records\nincluded in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that he telephoned me\nshortly after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House complex. I\nunderstand that Mr. Jordan testified that he and I did not discuss\nMs. Lewinsky during that call.\n\n   13. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky\nprior to December 17, 1997, a plan in which she would pretend to\nbring you papers with a work-related purpose, when in fact such\npapers had no work-related purpose, in order to conceal your\nrelationship?\n\n   14. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky\nprior to December 17, 1997, that Betty Currie should be the one to\nclear Ms. Lewinsky in to see you so that Ms. Lewinsky could say\nthat she was visiting with Ms. Currie instead of with you?\n\n   15. Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky\nprior to December 17, 1997, that if either of you were questioned\nabout the existence of your relationship you would deny its\nexistence?\n\n   19. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you\nsuggested to Monica Lewinsky that she could say to anyone inquiring\nabout her relationship with you that her visits to the Oval Office\nwere for the purpose of visiting with Betty Currie or to deliver\npapers to you?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 13, 14, 15, and 19:\n\n   I was asked essentially these same questions by O.I.C. lawyers.\nI testified that Ms. Lewinsky and I ``may have talked about what to\ndo in a nonlegal context at some point in the past, but I have no\nspecific memory of that conversation.'' That continues to be my\nrecollection today _ that is, any such conversation was not in\nconnection with her status as a witness in the Jones v. Clinton\ncase.\n\n   16. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 6, 1997, you\nlearned that Monica Lewinsky's name was on a witness list in the\ncase of Jones v. Clinton?\n\n   Response to Request No. 16:\n\n   As I stated in my August 17th grand jury testimony, I believe\nthat I found out that Ms. Lewinsky's name was on a witness list in\nthe Jones v. Clinton case late in the afternoon on the 6th of\nDecember, 1997. App, at 535.\n\n   17. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you\ntold Monica Lewinsky that her name was on the witness list in the\ncase of Jones v. Clinton?\n\n   18. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 17, 1997, you\nsuggested to Monica Lewinsky that the submission of an affidavit in\nthe case of Jones v. Clinton might suffice to prevent her from\nhaving to testify personally in that case?\n\n   Response to Requests Nos. 17 and 18:\n\n   As I previously testified, I recall telephoning Ms. Lewinsky to\ntell her Ms. Currie's brother had died, and that call was in the\nmiddle of December. I do not recall other particulars of such a\ncall, including whether we discussed the fact that her name was on\nthe Jones v. Clinton witness list. As I stated in my August 17th\ngrand jury testimony in response to essentially the same questions,\nit is quite possible that that happened. . . . I don't have any\nmemory of it, but I certainly wouldn't dispute that I might have\nsaid that (she was on the witness list).''\n\n   I recall that Ms. Lewinsky asked me at some time in December\nwhether she might be able to get out of testifying in the Jones v.\nClinton case because she knew nothing about Ms. Jones or the case.\nI told her I believed other witnesses had executed affidavits, and\nthere was a chance they would not have to testify. As I stated in\nmy August 17th grand jury testimony, ``I felt strongly that... (Ms.\nLewinsky) could execute an affidavit that would be factually\ntruthful, that might get her out of having to testify.'' I never\nasked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie in her affidavit, as Ms.\nLewinsky herself has confirmed.\n\n   19. For the Response to Request No. 19, see Response to Request\nNo. 13 et al., supra.\n\n   20. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading\ntestimony under oath when you stated during your deposition in the\ncase of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know\nif Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?\n\n   Response to Request No. 20:\n\n   It is evident from my testimony on pages 69 to 70 of the\ndeposition that I did know on January 17, 1998, that Ms. Lewinsky\nhad been subpoenaed in the Jones v. Clinton case. Ms. Jones'\nlawyer's question, ``Did you talk to Mr. Lindsey about what action,\nif any, should be taken as a result of her being served with a\nsubpoena?'', and my response, ``No,'' j. at 70, reflected my\nunderstanding that Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. That testimony\nwas not false and misleading.\n\n   21. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading\ntestimony under oath when you stated before the grand jury on\nAugust 17, 1998, that you did know prior to January 17, 1998, that\nMonica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in the case of Jones\nv. Clinton?\n\n   Response to Request No. 21:\n\n   As my testimony on January 17 reflected, and as I testified on\nAugust 17, 1998, I knew prior to January 17, 1998, that Ms.\nLewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in Jones v. Clinton. App.\nat 487. That testimony was not false and misleading.\n\n   22. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you\nhad a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House regarding\nher moving to New York?\n\n   nn\n\n   Response to Request No. 22:\n\n   When I met with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, I knew she\nwas planning to move to New York, and we discussed her move.\n\n   23. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you\nhad a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House in which\nyou suggested to her that she move to New York soon because by\nmoving to New York, the lawyers representing Paula Jones in the\ncase of Jones v. Clinton may not contact her?\n\n   Response to Request No. 23:\n\n   Ms. Lewinsky had decided to move to New York well before the end\nof December 1997. By December 28, Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed.\nI did not suggest that she could avoid testifying in the Jones v.\nClinton case by moving to New York.\n\n   24. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you\nhad a discussion with Monica Lewinsky at the White House regarding\ngifts you had given to Ms. Lewinsky that were subpoenaed in the\ncase of Jones v. Clinton?\n\n   25. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you\nexpressed concern to Monica Lewinsky about a hatpin you had given\nto her as a gift which had been subpoenaed in the case of Jones v.\nClinton?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 24 and 25:\n\n   As I told the grand jury, ``Ms. Lewinsky said something to me\nlike, what if they ask me about the gifts you've given me,'' but I\ndo not know whether that conversation occurred on December 28,\n1997, or earlier.\n\n   Whenever this conversation occurred, I testified, I told her\n``that if they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them\nwhatever she had. ...'' I simply was not concerned about the fact\nthat I had given her gifts. Indeed, I gave her additional gifts on\nDecember 28, 1997. I also told the grand jury that I do not recall\nMs. Lewinsky telling me that the subpoena specifically called for a\nhat pin that I had given her.\n\n   26. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1997, you\ndiscussed with Betty Currie gifts previously given by you to Monica\nLewinsky?\n\n   27. Do you admit or deny that on or about December 28, 1998, you\nrequested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise discussed with\nBetty Currie that she take possession of gifts previously given to\nMonica Lewinsky by you?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 26 and 27:\n\n   I do not recall any conversation with Ms. Currie on or about\nDecember 28, 1997, about gifts I had previously given to Ms.\nLewinsky. I never told Ms. Currie to take possession of gifts I had\ngiven Ms. Lewinsky; I understand Ms. Currie has stated that Ms.\nLewinsky called Ms. Currie to ask her to hold a box.\n\n   28. Do you admit or deny that you had a telephone conversation\non January 6, 1998, with Vernon Jordan during which you discussed\nMonica Lewinsky's affidavit, yet to be filed, in the case of Jones\nv. Clinton?\n\n   Response to Request No. 28:\n\n   White House records included in the O.I.C. Referral reflect that\nI spoke to Mr. Jordan on January 6, 1998. I do not recall whether\nwe discussed Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit during a telephone call on\nthat date.\n\n   29. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge of the fact that\nMonica Lewinsky executed for filing an affidavit in the case of\nJones v. Clinton on January 7, 1998?\n\n   30. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 7, 1998, you\nhad a discussion with Vernon Jordan in which he mentioned that\nMonica Lewinsky executed for filing an affidavit in the case of\nJones v. Clinton?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 29 and 30:\n\n   As I testified to the grand jury, ``I believe that (Mr. Jordan)\ndid notify us when she signed her affidavit. While I do not recall\nthe timing, as I told the grand jury, I have no reason to doubt Mr.\nJordan's statement that he notified me about the affidavit around\nJanuary 7, 1998.\n\n   31. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 7, 1998, you\nhad a discussion with Vernon Jordan in which he mentioned that he\nwas assisting Monica Lewinsky in finding a job in New York?\n\n   Response to Request No. 31:\n\n   I told the grand jury that I was aware that Mr. Jordan was\nassisting Ms. Lewinsky in her job search in connection with her\nmove to New York. I have no recollection as to whether Mr. Jordan\ndiscussed it with me on or about January 7, 1998.\n\n   32. Do you admit or deny that you viewed a copy of the affidavit\nexecuted by Monica Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, prior to your deposition in that case?\n\n   33. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that your\ncounsel viewed a copy of the affidavit executed by Monica Lewinsky\non January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton, prior to your\ndeposition in that case?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 32 and 33:\n\n   I do not believe I saw this affidavit before my deposition,\nalthough I cannot be absolutely sure. The record indicates that my\ncounsel had seen the affidavit at some time prior to the\ndeposition.\n\n   34. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that any facts\nor assertions contained in the affidavit executed by Monica\nLewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton were\nnot true?\n\n   40. Do you admit or deny that during your deposition in the case\nof Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, you affirmed that the\nfacts or assertions stated in the affidavit executed by Monica\nLewinsky on January 7, 1998, were true?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 34 and 40:\n\n   I was asked at my deposition in January about two paragraphs of\nMs. Lewinsky's affidavit. With respect to Paragraph 6, 1 explained\nthe extent to which I was able to attest to its accuracy.\n\n   With respect to Paragraph 8, I stated in my deposition that it\nwas true. In my August 17th grand jury testimony, I sought to\nexplain the basis for that deposition answer: ``I believe at the\ntime that she filled out this affidavit, if she believed that the\ndefinition of sexual relationship was two people having\nintercourse, then this is accurate.''\n\n   nn\n\n   35. Do you admit or deny that you viewed a copy of the affidavit\nexecuted by Monica Lewinsky on January 7, 1998, in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, at your deposition in that case on January 17,\n1998?\n\n   36. Do you admit or deny that you had knowledge that your\ncounsel viewed a copy of the affidavit executed by Monica Lewinsky\non January 7, 1998, in the case of Jones v. Clinton, at your\ndeposition in that case on January 17, 1998?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 35 and 36:\n\n   I know that Mr. Bennett saw Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit during the\ndeposition because he read portions of it aloud at the deposition.\nI do not recall whether I saw a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit\nduring the deposition.\n\n   37. Do you admit or deny that on or about January 9, 1998, you\nreceived a message from Vernon Jordan indicating that Monica\nLewinsky had received a job offer in New York?\n\n   Response to Request No. 37:\n\n   At some time, I learned that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job\noffer in New York. However, I do not recall whether I first learned\nit in a message from Mr. Jordan or whether I learned it on that\ndate.\n\n   38. Do you admit or deny that between January 9, 1998, and\nJanuary 15, 1998, you had a conversation with Erskine Bowles in the\nOval Office in which you stated that Monica Lewinsky received a job\noffer and had listed John Hilley as a reference?\n\n   39. Do you admit or deny that you asked Erskine Bowles if he\nwould ask John Hilley to give Ms. Lewinsky a positive job\nrecommendation?\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 38 and 39:\n\n   As I testified to the grand jury, I recall at some point talking\nto Mr. Bowles ``about whether Monica Lewinsky could get a\nrecommendation that was not negative from the Legislative Affairs\nOffice,'' or that ``was at least neutral,'' although I am not\ncertain of the date of the conversation. To suggest that I told Mr.\nBowles that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job offer and had listed\nJohn Hilley as a reference is, as I testified, a ``little bit''\ninconsistent with my memory. It is possible, as I also indicated,\nthat she had identified Mr. Hilley as her supervisor on her resume\nand in that respect had already listed him as a reference.\n\n   40. For the Response to Request No. 40, see Response to Request\nNo. 34, et al., supra.\n\n   41. As to each, do you admit or deny that you gave the following\ngifts to Monica Lewinsky at any time in the past?\n\n   a. A lithograph\n\n   b. A hatpin\n\n   c. A large ``Black Dog'' canvas bag\n\n   d. A large ``Rockettes'' blanket\n\n   e. A pin of the New York skyline\n\n   f. A box of ``cherry chocolates''\n\n   g. A pair of novelty sunglasses\n\n   h. A stuffed animal from the ``Black Dog''\n\n   i. A marble bear's head\n\n   j. A London pin\n\n   k. A shamrock pin\n\n   l. An Annie Lennox compact disc\n\n   m. Davidoff cigars\n\n   Response to Request No. 41:\n\n   In my deposition in the Jones case, I testified that I\n``certainly ... could have'' given Ms. Lewinsky a hat pin and that\nI gave her ``something'' from the Black Dog. In my grand jury\ntestimony, I indicated that in late December 1997, I gave Ms.\nLewinsky a Canadian marble bear's head carving, a Rockettes\nblanket, some kind of pin, and a bag (perhaps from the Black Dog)\nto hold these objects. I also stated that I might have given her\nsuch gifts as a box of candy and sunglasses, although I did not\nrecall doing so, and I specifically testified that I had given Ms.\nLewinsky gifts on other occasions. I do not remember giving her the\nother gifts listed in Question 41, although I might have. As I have\npreviously testified, I receive a very large number of gifts from\nmany different people, sometimes several at a time. I also give a\nvery large number of gifts. I gave Ms. Lewinsky gifts, some of\nwhich I remember and some of which I do not.\n\n   42. Do you admit or deny that when asked on January 17, 1998, in\nyour deposition in the case of Jones v. Clinton if you had ever\ngiven gifts to Monica Lewinsky, you stated that you did not recall,\neven though you actually had knowledge of giving her gifts in\naddition to gifts from the ``Black Dog?''\n\n   Response to Request No. 42:\n\n   In my grand jury testimony, I was asked about this same\nstatement. I explained that my full response was ``I don't recall.\nDo you know what they were?'' By that answer, I did not mean to\nsuggest that I did not recall giving gifts; rather, I meant that I\ndid not recall what the gifts were, and I asked for reminders.\n\n   43. Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading\ntestimony under oath in your deposition in the case of Jones v.\nClinton when you responded ``once or twice'' to the question ``has\nMonica Lewinsky ever given you any gifts?''\n\n   Response to Request No. 43:\n\n   My testimony was not false and misleading. As I have testified\npreviously, I give and receive numerous gifts. Before my January\n17, 1998, deposition, I had not focused on the precise number of\ngifts Ms. Lewinsky had given me. My deposition testimony made clear\nthat Ms. Lewinsky had given me gifts; at the deposition, I recalled\n``a book or two'' and a tie. At the time, those were the gifts I\nrecalled. In response to O.I.C. inquiries, after I had had a chance\nto search my memory and refresh my recollection, I was able to be\nmore responsive. However, as my counsel have informed the O.I.C.,\nin light of the very large number of gifts I receive, there might\nstill be gifts from Ms. Lewinsky that I have not identified.\n\n   44. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about\n5:38 P.M., after the conclusion of your deposition in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, you telephoned Vernon Jordan at his home?\n\n   Response to Request No. 44:\n\n   I speak to Mr. Jordan frequently, so I cannot remember specific\ntimes and dates. According to White House records included in the\nO.I.C. Referral, I telephoned Mr. Jordan's residence on January 17,\n1998, at or about 5:38 p.m.\n\n   45. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about\n7:02 P.M., after the conclusion of your deposition in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, you telephoned Betty Currie at her home?\n\n   46. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about\n7:02 P.M., after the conclusion of your deposition in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, you telephoned Vernon Jordan at his office?\n\n   47. Do you admit or deny that on January 17, 1998, at or about\n7:13 P.M., after the conclusion of your deposition in the case of\nJones v. Clinton, you telephoned Betty Currie at her home and asked\nher to meet with you the next day, Sunday, January 18, 1998?\n\n   nn\n\n   Response to Request Nos. 45. 46 and 47:\n\n   According to White House records included in the O.I.C.\nReferral, I placed a telephone call to Ms. Currie at her residence\nat 7:02 P.M. and spoke to her at or about 7:13 P.M. I recall that\nwhen I spoke to her that evening, I asked if she could meet with me\nthe following day. According to White House records included in the\nO.I.C. Referral, I telephoned Mr. Jordan's office on January 17,\n1998, at or about 7:02 P.M.\n\n   48. Do you admit or deny that on January 18, 1998, at or about\n6:11 A.M., you learned of the existence of tapes of conversations\nbetween Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp recorded by Linda Tripp?\n\n   Response to Request No. 48:\n\n   I did not know on January 18, 1998 that tapes existed of\nconversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp recorded by Ms.\nTripp. At some point on Sunday, January 18, 1998, I knew about the\nDrudge Report. I understand that, while the report talked about\ntapes of phone conversations, it did not identify Ms. Lewinsky by\nname and did not mention Ms. Tripp at all.

Do you admit or deny the past or present existence of or the\npast or present direct or indirect employment of individuals, other\nthan counsel representing you, whose duties include making contact\nwith or gathering information about witnesses or potential\nwitnesses in any judicial proceeding related to any matter in which\nyou are or could be involved?\n\n   Response to Request No. 72:\n\n   I cannot respond to this inquiry because of the vagueness of its\nterms (``indirect,'' ``potential,'' ``could be involved''). To the\nextent it may be interpreted to apply to individuals assisting\ncounsel, please see my responses to Request Nos. 73-75.

Do you admit or deny having knowledge that Betsy Wright was\ncontacted or employed to make contact with or gather information\nabout witnesses or potential witnesses in any judicial proceeding\nrelated to any matter in which you are or could be involved?\n\n   nn\n\n   Response to Request No. 75:\n\n   Ms. Betsey Wright was my longtime chief of staff when I was\nGovernor of Arkansas, and she remains a good friend and trusted\nadviser. Because of her great knowledge of Arkansas, from time to\ntime my legal counsel and I have consulted with her on a wide range\nof matters. See also Response to No. 72.\n\n   76. Do you admit or deny that you made false and misleading\npublic statements in response to questions asked on or about\nJanuary 21, 1998, in an interview with ``Roll Call,'' when you\nstated ``Well, let me say, the relationship was not improper, and I\nthink that's important enough to say. But because the investigation\nis going on and because I don't know what is out _ what's going to\nbe asked of me, I think I need to cooperate, answer the questions,\nbut I think it's important for me to make it clear what is not. And\nthen, at the appropriate time, I'll try to answer what is. But let\nme answer _ it is not an improper relationship and I know what the\nword means.''?\n\n   Response to Request No. 76:\n\n   The tape of this interview reflects that in fact I said: ``Well,\nlet me say the relationship's not improper and I think that's\nimportant enough to say. . . .'' With that revision, the quoted\nwords accurately reflect my remarks. As I stated in Response to\nRequest Nos. 62 to 68, in the days following the January 21, 1998,\ndisclosures, I misled people about this relationship, for which I\nhave apologized.\n\n   77. Do you admit or deny that you made false and misleading\npublic statements in response to questions asked on or about\nJanuary 21, 1998, in the Oval Office during a photo opportunity,\nwhen you stated: ``Now, there are a lot of other questions that\nare, I think, very legitimate. You have a right to ask them; you\nand the American people have a right to get answers. We are working\nvery hard to comply and get all the requests for information up\nhere, and we will give you as many answers as we can, as soon as we\ncan, at the appropriate time, consistent with our obligation to\nalso cooperate with the investigations. And that's not a dodge,\nthat's really (what) I've _ I've talked with (our) people. I want\nto do that. I'd like for you to have more rather than less, sooner\nrather than later. So we'll work through it as quickly as we can\nand get all those questions out there to you.''?\n\n   Response to Request No. 77:\n\n   I made this statement (as corrected), according to a transcript\nof a January 22, 1998 photo opportunity in the Oval Office.

Do you admit or deny that you made a false and misleading\npublic statement in response to a question asked on or about\nJanuary 26, 1998, when you stated ``But I want to say one thing to\nthe American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say\nthis again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.\nLewinsky''?\n\n   Response to Request No. 79:\n\n   I made this statement on January 26, 1998, although not in\nresponse to any question. In referring to ``sexual relations'', I\nwas referring to sexual intercourse. As I stated in Response to\nRequest Nos. 62 to 68, in the days following the January 21, 1998,\ndisclosures, answers like this misled people about this\nrelationship, for which I have apologized.\n\n   80.

Thereafter, I\nunderstand that the Presidential communications privilege was\nasserted as to certain questions asked of Sidney Blumenthal and\nNancy Hernreich. Further, I understand that, as to Mr. Blumenthal\nand Ms. Hernreich, all claims of official privilege were\nsubsequently withdrawn and they testified fully on several\noccasions before the grand jury.\n\n   Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Breuer testified at length before the grand\njury about a wide range of matters, but declined, on the advice of\nthe White House counsel, to answer certain questions that sought\ndisclosure of discussions that they had with me and my senior\nadvisers concerning, among other things, their legal advice as to\nthe assertion of executive privilege. White House counsel advised\nMr. Lindsey and Mr. Breuer that these communications were protected\nby the attorney-client privilege, as well as executive privilege.\nMr. Lindsey also asserted my personal attorney-client privilege as\nto certain questions relating to his role as an intermediary\nbetween me and my personal counsel in the Jones v. Clinton case, a\nprivilege that was upheld by the Federal appeals court in the\nDistrict of Columbia.\n","Headline":"\nTEXT OF PRESIDENT'S RESPONSES TO HOUSE JUDICIARY PANEL'S\nQUESTIONS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Following are President Clinton's answers to the 81\nquestions put to him by the House Judiciary Committee as part of\nits impeachment investigation, as made public Friday by the White\nHouse:\n","\n   Set forth below are answers to the questions that you have asked\nme.\n","\n   I would like to repeat, at the outset, something that I have\nsaid before about my approach to these proceedings. I have asked my\nattorneys to participate actively, but the fact that there is a\nlegal defense to the various allegations cannot obscure the hard\ntruth, as I have said repeatedly, that my conduct was wrong. It was\nalso wrong to mislead people about what happened, and I deeply\nregret that.\n","\n   For me, this long ago ceased to be primarily a legal or\npolitical issue and became instead a painful personal one,\ndemanding atonement and daily work toward reconciliation and\nrestoration of trust with my family, my friends, my Administration\nand the American people. I hope these answers will contribute to a\nspeedy and fair resolution of this matter.\n","\n   1. Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law-enforcement\nofficer of the United States of America?\n","\n   Response to Request No. 1:\n","\n   The President is frequently referred to as the chief\nlaw-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution\nspecifically designates the President as such. Article II, Section\n1 of the United States Constitution states that ``(t)he executive\npower shall be vested in a President of the United States of\nAmerica,'' and the law-enforcement function is a component of the\nexecutive power.\n","\n   2.

Clinton on January 17, 1998?\n","\n   Response to Request No. 5:\n","\n   I took an oath to tell the truth on January 17, 1998, before my\ndeposition in the Jones v. Clinton case. While I do not recall the\nprecise wording of that oath, as I previously stated in my grand\njury testimony on August 17, 1998, in taking the oath ``I believed\nthen that I had to answer the questions truthfully.''\n","\n   6.

I do not recall receiving a letter\nin which she expressed dissatisfaction about her New York job\nsearch. I understand Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she sent a note\nindicating her decision to seek employment in New York, but I do\nnot believe she has said the note expressed dissatisfaction about\nher search for a job there.

Records\nincluded in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that Ms. Lewinsky visited\nthe White House on October 11, 1997, and I may have seen her on\nthat day.\n","\n   I do not believe I suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Jordan\nmight be able to assist her in her job search, and I understand\nthat Ms. Lewinsky has stated that she asked me if Mr. Jordan could\nassist her in finding a job in New York.\n","\n   I speak to Mr. Jordan often, and I understand that records\nincluded in the O.I.C. Referral indicate that he telephoned me\nshortly after Ms. Lewinsky left the White House complex.

Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky\nprior to December 17, 1997, that Betty Currie should be the one to\nclear Ms. Lewinsky in to see you so that Ms. Lewinsky could say\nthat she was visiting with Ms. Currie instead of with you?\n","\n   15.

I do not recall other particulars of such a\ncall, including whether we discussed the fact that her name was on\nthe Jones v. Clinton witness list. As I stated in my August 17th\ngrand jury testimony in response to essentially the same questions,\nit is quite possible that that happened. . . . I don't have any\nmemory of it, but I certainly wouldn't dispute that I might have\nsaid that (she was on the witness list).''\n","\n   I recall that Ms. Lewinsky asked me at some time in December\nwhether she might be able to get out of testifying in the Jones v.\nClinton case because she knew nothing about Ms. Jones or the case.\nI told her I believed other witnesses had executed affidavits, and\nthere was a chance they would not have to testify. As I stated in\nmy August 17th grand jury testimony, ``I felt strongly that... (Ms.\nLewinsky) could execute an affidavit that would be factually\ntruthful, that might get her out of having to testify.'' I never\nasked or encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie in her affidavit, as Ms.\nLewinsky herself has confirmed.\n","\n   19.

To suggest that I told Mr.\nBowles that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job offer and had listed\nJohn Hilley as a reference is, as I testified, a ``little bit''\ninconsistent with my memory.

I also stated that I might have given her\nsuch gifts as a box of candy and sunglasses, although I did not\nrecall doing so, and I specifically testified that I had given Ms.\nLewinsky gifts on other occasions.

My deposition testimony made clear\nthat Ms. Lewinsky had given me gifts; at the deposition, I recalled\n``a book or two'' and a tie. At the time, those were the gifts I\nrecalled.
