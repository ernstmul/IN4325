The\nyear-old German shepherd disappeared from La Flam's rural Lake\nEaton home when the Rainbow Family started arriving five weeks ago.\n\n   No, she says flatly, it's not possible the dog ran away.\n\n   ``He loved it at our house,'' she says. ``And what about the\nfour other dogs missing from our neighborhood? My 9-year-old still\ncries about it.''\n\n   For the past 13 years, the Rainbow Family has had mid-February\ngatherings in this 430,000-acre national forest 65 miles west of\nDaytona Beach. Some people who live near the forest describe\nRainbows as peaceful, polite, flower children with a devout respect\nfor themselves, the earth and other people.\n\n   ``They don't bother anyone,'' says Barbara Slater, who lives in\nAltoona. ``We've even picked a couple of them up in our pickup\ntruck. They always say `thank you.' If you had a problem on the\nroad, they'd probably help you.''\n\n   And then you hear about dog-eating, shoplifting hippies who\ngather in the forest to dance naked, smoke pot, trip on LSD and\nhave random sex.\n\n   Follow the Rainbow People into the forest, and you'll find both\nsides of the truth.\n\n   COME ON PEOPLE NOW, SMILE ON YOUR BROTHER\n\n   Rainbow People. The Rainbow Family. The Rainbow Family of Living\nLight. Warriors of the Light.\n\n   Whatever the name, Rainbows take pride in a sketchy history, no\nleaders, no membership numbers and no rules. Their shared\nphilosophy borrows from Native American folklore, Tibetan Buddhism,\nTaoism, Hinduism or any other ``ism'' based on tolerance,\nnonviolence, peace and love.\n\n   To a Rainbow, the 9-to-5 world is Babylon.\n\n   The Rainbow Family, they're fond of saying, is open to everyone\nwith a belly button. And this family ranges from 2-month-old\ninfants to aging Baby Boomers. Teen runaways are a chronic problem.\nMarion County Sheriff's Lt. Mel Haun found two in the forest. But\nmany of the Ocala Rainbows were twenty-somethings _ college kids\nwith expensive, top-of-the-line camping gear _ as well as premature\nburnouts and dropouts.\n\n   Deputies and U.S. Forest Service workers say what surprises them\nmost about a Rainbow gathering are the BMWs, Jags and other\nexpensive cars parked near the camp.\n\n   ``There were at least four lawyers, six registered nurses and\nprobably two doctors, but they were really quiet,'' says Barry\nSacharow, 44, a member of the governing Rainbow Council and a Fort\nLauderdale paralegal.\n\n   The first Rainbow gathering was in 1972 near Strawberry Lake in\nColorado, when counterculture survivors extended an invitation to\nVietnam vets. The Rainbow Gathering theme, then as now, remains\n``Welcome Home.'' The Vietnam vets brought survival skills to the\ndeep-woods party, and the counterculture brought a willingness to\nlearn and work.\n\n   Much of what the two groups established 28 years ago and after\nis the basis of gatherings such as the one in Ocala that ended\nSunday. Camps are set up with communal kitchens and a CALM (Center\nfor Alternative Living Medicine) tent. Single mothers with small\nchildren camp at Kid Village. Rainbow veterans park their campers\nat Bus Village. Teens camp at the Ghetto.\n\n   Rainbow decisions are made by a fluid, ever-changing council\nopen to anyone who shows up at the meeting. Those making decisions\nare called focalizers because they are willing and able to focus.\n\n   There are regional gatherings, such as Ocala, and national and\ninternational ones. The next annual U.S. meeting, expected to draw\nmore than 30,000, will happen somewhere in Montana, sometime around\nJuly 4. Rainbow scouts have yet to find or announce a site.\n\n   Even basic Rainbow information evolves at its own pace. Some\nwill find out through word of mouth, some on the Internet, some by\nphone.\n\n   THE CAMP\n\n   The Rainbows at Ocala _ more than 2,000, says the group; more\nlike 1,000, says the U.S. Forest Service _ camped deep in the\nforest of weathered cypress and stately pines.\n\n   From the nearest dirt roads, it was a 2-mile hike to the camp's\nhub, Main Circle, the site of nightly bonfires. You walked through\nraw forest and along dry, grassy trails. There were no signs to\nguide you.\n\n   The heart of every winter meeting is the week leading up to the\nSaturday night with a full moon that's closest to Feb. 14. If\nthere's no full moon, the first Saturday after Valentine's Day will\ndo.\n\n   Some Rainbows, called Road Dogs, begin camping in October for\nthe February event. They are usually strapped for food, and this is\nwhen the shoplifting and missing dog reports begin.\n\n   With a full moon Feb. 19, there was a festive mood approaching\nthe gathering's big night.\n\n   Friday, around noon, campers were crawling out of tents and from\nunder pieces of plastic and wet sleeping bags under trees. Maybe\nthere would be coffee or tea at the communal Shanghai Kitchen near\nthe Heart Fire. Maybe at the Aztec Groves Cafe, there would remain\nsome of the grapefruits that a skilled Dumpster Diver from Vermont\nscored from a Costco trash bin in Daytona.\n\n   Much like any city, there were popular stops. Zsu-Zsu's could be\nloosely called a bakery with its sugar food, such as cookies and\nKool-Aid, to combat low blood sugar and dehydration. For\nentertainment there was The Granola Funk Theater, offering\nNo-Talent, Talent and Skit nights. Various workshops were impromptu\n_ drum tuning, weaving, guitar playing, herb tours or whatever\nsomeone was willing to teach.\n\n   At dusk the free kitchens served rice and beans.\n\n   And then came the main event at the Main Circle's Heart Fire: a\nbonfire built in a pit shaped like a heart.\n\n   Campers, many with drums, circled the raging fire, some naked,\nsome too high to stand and take off their clothes. The party went\non all night, with the drummers and dancers becoming like machines\nfueled by pot, hash and LSD. Under the stars and benevolent moon,\nthere were enough drugs to drum and sing and dance until the sun\nrose and muscles finally gave out and, like the rising sun,\nexhaustion couldn't be ignored.\n\n   But that was night. Daytime was not so dramatic.\n\n   When the sun warmed, there was skinny-dipping in any of the\nhalf-dozen ponds and lakes, each home to alligators. Ask a Rainbow\nman if that's not dangerous, and he'd tell you Brother Gator knows\nRainbows won't hurt him, ``but we have lost some of our dogs.''\n\n   Emerging from a stand of scrub pines into a clearing was a\nscrawny kid dirty as tree bark. A striking woman passed him. She\nwas in her early 20s, dressed in crisp, clean, flowing Indian\ngauze, purple and green. She looked like she could have been headed\nto market in New Delhi.\n\n   ``Morning, sister,'' the scrawny kid said as she followed the\npath he just left.\n\n   ``Hello, brother.''\n\n   Once in the trees, within seconds she screamed,\n``EEEEEE-YEWWW!''\n\n   The scrawny kid froze.\n\n   ``Sorry, sister, I forgot to cover it.''\n\n   There are no restrooms at a Rainbow gathering.\n\n   LOSE THE SOAP\n\n   If you enter a Rainbow gathering with your pockets full of LSD,\nbricks of hash and pot under each arm, and a bar of soap in hand,\nyou'll be told to lose the soap.\n\n   Soap is not allowed. Rainbows say soap can pollute the forest's\nrivers, lakes and ground water.\n\n   ``If someone shows up smelling from shampoo,'' says author and\nRainbow scholar Michael Niman, ``people are going to get all over\ntheir case. It's an environmental thing.'' One benefit, he adds, is\nthat the smoky grime that covers everyone's skin is a natural bug\nrepellent.\n\n   Arresting a Rainbow is dreaded by Marion County deputies because\nof the long drive down U.S. 40 to jail in Ocala. ``They smell so\nbad,'' says Lt. Haun, ``you've got to ride with the windows down.''\n\n   The smell factor cuts down on more than mosquito bites, says\nNiman, an American studies professor at the State University of New\nYork at Buffalo. He spent 13 years researching the Rainbow movement\nfor a doctoral thesis that became the 1997 book ``People of the\nRainbow: A Nomadic Utopia.''\n\n   ``That's also why it's not the big orgy that the media makes it\nout to be. The bottom line is that people smell bad after a few\ndays in the woods, and you don't want to get close to them.\n\n   ``Spending a week in the woods is rough on human aesthetics.''\n\n   `A' CAMP\n\n   Some Rainbow brothers and sisters consider this winter camp the\nRolling Stones-At-Altamonte of gatherings. There are more drugs,\nmore losers and lunatics than at any other gathering.\n\n   When campers start arriving, weeks or months before the actual\nevent, Haun and other Marion County Sheriff's deputies start\ngetting calls from grocery stores and restaurants.\n\n   ``Shoplifting,'' Haun says, glumly, ``that's constant.''\n\n   But it can get worse.\n\n   In January, a man calling himself a Rainbow robbed a Winn-Dixie,\nat one point holding a hunting knife to the manager's throat. He\nwas caught in South Carolina.\n\n   Haun, a 17-year veteran, has worked the past eight Rainbow\nGatherings from his sheriff's substation at the north end of the\nforest. He says the bad guys aren't the real Rainbows.\n\n   ``The real Rainbows are just the hippie types in old, handmade\nclothes,'' he begins. ``They're hard to describe, but they're not\nthe hard cases.''\n\n   The hard cases are at ``A'' Camp.\n\n   Rainbows segregate alcohol drinkers. Those people live at A Camp\nat the north entrance. It's easily accessible for beer runs _ and\narrests. Every serious offense at the Ocala gathering was at A\nCamp. A Rainbow who took a swing at a U.S. Forest Service law\nenforcement officer was arrested. Two A Camp men were arrested for\nbeating each other with a baseball bat.\n\n   A Camp is any Rainbow gathering's lunatic fringe. Panhandling at\nthe entrance. Breaking into cars. Breaking into fights. A-Campers\nare known to wash down LSD with beer and liquor.\n\n   The A Camp presents a philosophical dilemma for Rainbows.\n\n   ``Because we have no leadership, we can't kick anybody out,''\nsays Sacharow. ``And you can't really call a Rainbow Gathering\nnonviolent if you call the police with guns and clubs and handcuffs\nto take away anybody who might be violent. Then you're not\nnonviolent.\n\n   ``It's an embarrassing reality that Utopia has a ghetto.''\n\n   SO WHAT HAPPENED TO BEETHOVEN?\n\n   Rainbow veteran Whistler, 53, says, ``I'm not going to sit here\nand tell you a Rainbow never ate a dog.'' But then he added that\nit's his experience, going back to the '72 gathering, that missing\nlocal dogs usually go home when the camp breaks.\n\n   Eating a dog sounds a bit bizarre and definitely un-Rainbow-like\nto Niman.\n\n   ``The Rainbows aren't about covering things up,'' he said. ``If\nanyone had an inkling, they'd freak out at the thought that someone\nwas stealing dogs and eating them. You're dealing with a large\npopulation of vegetarians who are horrified that people eat ham\nsandwiches.''\n\n   It's even more unlikely, says Niman, that the notorious\nA-Campers and Road Dogs would harm a dog. ``These people live on\nthe road, and being hermits, often, their closest friends are their\ndogs.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   OCALA NATIONAL FOREST, Fla. _ Jane La Flam is not ready to\naccuse anyone of eating her dog.\n","\n   But someone needs to explain what happened to Beethoven.
