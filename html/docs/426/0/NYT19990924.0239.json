However, he\nwould not give the agency unlimited power.\n\n   ``I don't believe that somebody from Washington should be\ntelling the people at the border what's the best way to fight\ndrugs,'' he said.\n\n   However, many panel members argued that the federal agencies\nwould never voluntarily coordinate their efforts enough to be\neffective.\n\n   Subcommittee chairman John Mica, R-Fla., suggested that Congress\nneeds to force the different agencies to work together. ``Do we a\nlaw that give you or some agency the authority to require\ncoordination?'' Mica asked McCaffrey.\n\n   McCaffrey said he believed passing a law was unnecessary and\nthat coordination could be achieved by ``bringing together the\nagency heads and letting common sense push policy.''\n\n   But Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, who called the drug trade an\n``invasion,'' said the United States doesn't have time to wait for\nthe various federal agencies to learn how to work together against\nillegal narcotics.\n\n   ``I don't believe that meetings and joint task forces and all\nthese other operations will do the job,'' she said.\n\n   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, a former border patrol section\nchief, also pushed McCaffrey on the need for a law, saying, ``It's\nimportant that these coordinators have some clout to force agencies\nto use their resources in a way they are expected to.''\n\n   But McCaffrey bluntly told the subcommittee that he didn't think\nCongress could pass a law that would force the different agencies\nto work together.\n\n   ``I see no possibility of getting the various congressional\ncommittees to get through a bill to put a coordinator in charge of\nall these agencies and departments,'' he said.\n\n   McCaffrey, noting that the U.S.-Mexico border has become the\nmajor entrance for illegal drugs into the United States, said that\nlast year the U.S. Customs Service seized almost 32,000 pounds of\ncocaine, 850,000 pounds of marijuana and 407 pounds of heroin along\nthe southwest border.\n\n   The Drug Enforcement Agency estimates that up to 70 percent of\nthe cocaine, 50 percent of the marijuana and 20 percent of the\nheroin in the United States now comes across that border.\n\n   (Mark Helm can be reached at 202-298-6920 or at the e-mail\naddress mark(at)hearstdc.com)\n","Headline":"\nDRUG CZAR SAYS BUREAUCRATIC INFIGHTING HURTS NARCOTICS WAR \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Bitter turf wars and a lack of coordination among\nfederal law enforcement agencies have hampered the fight against\nillegal drugs along the U.S.-Mexico border, White House drug policy\nchief Barry McCaffrey told Congress Friday.\n","\n   ``We have 23 federal agencies dealing with the fight against\ndrugs, but to be frank, their ability to work together is\ncompletely inadequate,'' McCaffrey admitted to a House panel.\n","\n   Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice,\nDrug Policy and Human Resources, McCaffrey said valuable\ninformation gathered on drug operations by one agency often fails\nto reach other agencies that could use it to stop narcotics\ntraffickers.\n","\n   State and local law enforcement officers have ``a very difficult\ntime'' getting intelligence on drug operations from federal\nagencies, he said.\n","\n   ``It's a major failure of our effort against illegal drug\ntrafficking that local and state law enforcement officers don't\nhave one place to go to get information gathered by federal\nagencies on drug operations in their districts,'' he added.\n","\n   McCaffrey said the 23 agencies operating along the border have\nfive parent departments: Treasury, which is responsible for seizing\nillegal drugs and halting money laundering and firearms\ntrafficking; Justice, which enforces drug and immigration laws and\nprosecutes criminal cases under those laws; Transportation, which\nhelps interdict illegal drugs at border crossings; State, which\nruns joint counter-drug programs with Mexico, and Defense, which\nprovides aircraft and radar to help police catch traffickers.\n","\n   McCaffrey suggested putting one federal agency in charge of\ncoordinating anti-narcotics efforts at each of the major points of\ntrade and drug activity along the U.S.-Mexico border.
