Richard Felosky, district manager for the city Animal Services\ndepartment.\n\n   ``Some of the dogs show that they are overly aggressive or\ndangerous and have to be euthanized.''\n\n   He said his staff tries to warn people adopting pit bulls of the\nresponsibility they're assuming.\n\n   ``They give them information on the type of animal that they\nwant to adopt,'' he said, ``what will happen if they don't\nsocialize them with other animals or family members, what will\nhappen if they don't train it. But it's often just so many words.\nThey just take the dog home anyway.''\n\n   The breed is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, which\nlicenses dog breeders.\n\n   ``The pit bull is almost an underground breed,'' said Gini\nBarrett of the American Humane Association. A variation of the\nStaffordshire bull terrier, pit bulls don't have a long history.\n\n   ``Before 1984, you couldn't find a pit bull in L.A.,'' Barrett\nsaid.\n\n   Today, pit bulls and pit bull mixes account for 40 percent to 50\npercent of the city's shelter population, said Jackie David of\nAnimal Services.\n\n   Barrett attributes the population explosion to a reaction to a\n1980s crime wave. ``Out of fear, people got bigger, more\nfearsome-looking dogs,'' she said. ``But part of that crime wave\nwas illegal dog fighting.''\n\n   Barrett said the dogs do not bite more frequently, but their\nbites are more severe because the animals have such strong jaws.\n\n   Both Felosky and Barrett stressed that owners should neuter\ntheir dogs, train them and keep them appropriately confined.\n\n   ``Having a pit bull or any large, strong breed of dog is a\nspecial responsibility,'' Barrett said. ``Not everyone should have\nthem.''   !dlim!!end!  \n","Headline":"\nPIT BULL OWNERS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF PETS\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Blamed for a series of vicious attacks on people\nin recent weeks, pit bulls found a champion Thursday: their owners.\n","\n   About 10 pit bull owners and lovers of the breed rallied on the\nfront lawn of an Encino home to try to counter negative publicity\ngenerated by a series of attacks in Granada Hills and the fatal\nmauling of a child in South Central Los Angeles.\n","\n   ``It's not bad dogs, it's uneducated owners.
