Times News Service   \n\n   CARMEL, N.Y. _ The judge who presided over nine months of often\ncontentious testimony in the Tawana Brawley slander suit issued his\nfinal decision in the case Friday, ruling that Miss Brawley\nherself, the central, elusive character in this drawn-out\nmelodrama, must pay $185,000 in damages for defaming Steven\nPagones.\n\n   The judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme Court, said in a\nharshly worded decision that Miss Brawley could well have been\nfined much more because she was the person most responsible for\nfalsely accusing Pagones of rape and because she had ``literally\nthumbed her nose'' at the court by refusing to testify about the\naccusations she first made 11 years ago.\n\n   But based on his sense that she was a woman ``caught up in her\nown fiction'' who might have been manipulated by her family and her\nadvisers _ the Rev.
