Gale T. Griess of the Nebraska State Patrol said the patrol\nhands off most seizures to federal agencies so it doesn't have to\nsplit the money with education, as state law requires.  \n\n   In Kansas, police are allowed most of the money back under state\nlaw. Nonetheless, the Kansas Highway Patrol admits handing off\nmoney to federal agencies.  \n\n   And surprisingly, even in states such as Alabama that let law\nenforcement keep all the forfeiture money after costs, police still\ncan be found giving their seizures to federal agencies. The reason:\nForfeitures are easier under federal law.  \n\n   Law enforcement officials say police are justified when they\nmake that choice.  \n\n   ``If they are out enforcing the law and they are seizing\nproperty from criminals, and they are doing it in conjunction with\nthe federal government, they are not getting around (state) law,\nthey are helping enforce federal law,'' said McDowell of the\nJustice Department.  \n\n   {( End optional trims )}\n\n   But /{The Star/} found that more than two-thirds of all states\nappear to prohibit handing off money to federal agencies without\npermission of a state court.  \n\n   Those states have requirements that courts have called\n``turnover orders.'' Many of the provisions read like the one in\nIllinois:  \n\n   ``Property taken or detained under this section ... is deemed to\nbe in the custody of the law enforcement department or agency\nemploying the seizing officer subject only to the orders and\njudgments of the circuit court having jurisdiction over the\nforfeiture proceedings.''  \n\n   That means only a state judge can transfer a seizure to a\nfederal agency, legal experts say.  \n\n   ``This statute is not difficult at all,'' said David Harris, a\nUniversity of Toledo law professor and constitutional expert. ``The\nstate court has jurisdiction.''  \n\n   A half-dozen state and federal court decisions have backed that\ninterpretation.  \n\n   ``A local police department may not take seized property and\njust pass it on as it pleases to the FBI in flagrant disregard of\nstate laws,'' according to a federal circuit court opinion in an\nIllinois case.  \n\n   Gene Zoegtlin, legislative counsel for the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, said he was aware of the turnover\nprovisions but was unfamiliar with how they worked. He referred\nquestions to the Justice Department, which did not respond.  \n\n   But even some prosecutors concede police can't just hand off\nforfeitures.  \n\n   Under Alabama law, a court must decide when to transfer seizures\nto a federal agency, not police, said Yvonne Saxon, Alabama\nassistant attorney general.  \n\n   ``If you read the statute literally, there is no choice,'' Saxon\nsaid.  \n\n   When questioned, police offer a number of reasons for not\nfollowing turnover orders:  \n\n   -- They did not know the law existed.  \n\n   -- They did not really seize the money _ they were only holding\nit until a federal agency could officially seize it for\nforfeiture.  \n\n   -- Money seized on an interstate highway may be involved in\ninterstate drug trafficking, and therefore is a federal matter.  \n\n   -- Police officers sometimes are not really acting as local\npolice _ they've been deputized to be federal agents, even though\nthey are still paid by local or state governments. And cash becomes\nfederal property when a deputized officer picks it up, they say.  \n\n   For its part, the DEA says a state case becomes federal if\npolice investigating the case ask a DEA agent to come to the scene\nof the crime. ``That agent can seize the asset on behalf of the DEA\nand initiate a federal forfeiture proceeding,'' the DEA wrote in\nresponse to questions from /{The Star/}.  \n\n   Critics say such reasoning is legally dubious and seems an\nattempt to obscure the real issue _ police want the money, and that\ngenerally requires evading their state laws.  \n\n   Indeed, police say they need the money if they are to continue\nthe war on drugs. If they lose forfeiture money, they say, local\ngovernments are unlikely to replace it.  \n\n   {( Begin optional trim )}\n\n   For example, Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the special\ninvestigations unit for Albuquerque, N.M., police, pointed out that\nhis unit costs about $1 million a year, of which the city only\nfunds about $250,000.  \n\n   Joseph McNamara, former San Jose and Kansas City police chief,\nsaid city officials can take some of the blame for the federal\nhand-offs.  \n\n   He recalls one year in San Jose his department's tentative\nbudget had no money for equipment, so McNamara asked the city\nmanager why.  \n\n   ``He kind of waved his hand dismissively and said, `Well, you\nguys seized $4 million last year, I expect you to do better this\nyear,'' McNamara said.  \n\n   State law doesn't account for the cost of doing drug\ninvestigations, so police are justified in bypassing it, said\nMissouri Highway Patrol Sgt.
