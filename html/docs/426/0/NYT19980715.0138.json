So maybe that's what's meant by ``the dog days of summer.''\n\n   In any case, the aroma of sizzling pups has begun to waft over\nthe landscape, taking its place alongside suntan lotion and freshly\nmowed grass as a significant smell of summer. But if a hot dog\nseems a simple pleasure to most of us, connoisseurs of this\nparticular type of cooked sausage know differently. In short,\nthere's more to hot dogs _ a.k.a. franks, frankfurters, wieners,\nweenies, red hots, and so forth _ than meets the tongue.\n\n   Every junk-food trend spotter knows that 1992 marked the\nemergence of ``low-fat'' hot dogs (3 or fewer grams of fat), while\n1995 signaled the arrival of that apparent oxymoron, the ``no fat''\nhot dog (less than 0.5 gram of fat). But while such so-called\n``better-for-you'' franks were able to grab some quick market\nshare, they've now leveled off at between 10 and 15 percent of all\nUS sales.\n\n   The king of American dogs remains the beef-pork combination,\nwhich accounts for about 60 percent of US retail sales. Beef is\nnext at approximately 25 percent, with poultry representing about\n12 percent. But there are sharp regional differences. At Star\nMarkets, for example, beef franks represent about 70 percent of all\nfrankfurters sold, with beef-pork accounting for most of the rest.\n``That's true throughout New England,'' says Jim MacDonald, Star\nvice president for perishable merchandising. ``We're an area that's\nnot so much beef-dominant as pork-resistant.''\n\n   Don't tell that to Matt Monkiewicz, who is hot dog product\nmanager at Kayem Foods Inc. in Chelsea, Mass. Monkiewicz, who\nrepresents the fourth generation of his family to make dogs, points\nout that Kayem's beef-pork franks, sold largely to delicatessens,\noutsell the company's beef line.\n\n   And please don't talk to him about turkey dogs or chicken dogs.\n``Poultry is a little less firm, a little mushier,'' he contends\npolitely. ``You don't get the juiciness you get with pork and beef.\nThat's really not the kind of product we want under the Kayem\nlabel.''\n\n   There are hot dogs and there are hot dogs. And then there are\nmore hot dogs. Kayem alone makes 108 varieties, ranging from 5 to\n12 inches in length. Odd dogs you might find in a local grocery\nstore include buffalo dogs, vegetable dogs, and tofu dogs. There\nare kosher dogs, too, of course. On the road, you might encounter\nthe likes of chili dogs, Chicago dogs, Coney Island dogs, nacho\ndogs, and sauerkraut dogs. Most hot dogs are stripped of their\nskins after they're cooked during processing, although many\naficionados prefer a hot dog that arrives in a natural casing, i.e.\nan exterior made of animal intestines.\n\n   Hot dogs have a deserved reputation as a high-fat food. Beef and\npork dogs contain the most fat (usually about 12 to 22 grams),\nwhile beef franks have somewhat less (7 to 17 grams). Hot dogs\naren't recommended for someone trying to cut down on salt: Most\ncontain between 300 and 700 milligrams of sodium.\n\n   However, eating a chicken or a turkey dog isn't always a low-fat\nexperience. Example: A 1.5-ounce Applegate Farms beef frank\ncontains 7 grams of fat, while a Weaver 1.6-ounce chicken frank has\n9 grams. But maybe the fat factor doesn't matter to people, what\nwith only 10 to 15 percent of US hot dog sales being of the low-fat\nor no-fat variety. ``There's a certain perception out there that a\nhot dog ain't a hot dog if you take the fat out,'' points out Janet\nRiley, an executive of the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council, a\ntrade organization.\n\n   There are many ways to cook a dog _ grilling, boiling, broiling,\nsteaming, microwaving and deep-frying. The major methods are\nboiling and grilling, but Julia Child feels that appearance should\ndictate preference. ``Grilling hot dogs _ or even sauteing them in\na pan _ makes them look nicer, don't you think?'' advises the\nCambridge food doyenne. ``And if they're grilled or sauteed,\nthey're better split because, again, they look better that way.''\n\n   ``Dressing the dog'' is important, too. Ketchup is popular among\nkids, of course. But it's also big among Gen Xers, according to\nresearch done by National Foods, the maker of Hebrew National\nfranks. Folks from ages 55 to 64 much prefer mustard, the company\nsays.\n\n   Preferences for certain toppings vary by region as well. Ketchup\nrules in the north-central United States, for example, while\nmayonnaise is popular in the South and West. According to Kayem,\nmustard is New England's most popular dressing, followed by\nketchup, then relish.\n\n   And what about the roll? Squishy American-style hot dog rolls\nprevail, but there are backers of sesame seed, poppy seed, kaiser\nrolls, potato rolls (in Philadelphia), and sourdough rolls (in San\nFrancisco). But please: no sun-dried tomato rolls, not even in San\nFrancisco.\n\n   The National Hot Dog & Sausage Council says that eating a\nstandard hot dog and bun should require no more than five bites.\nAnd the organization also advises against wine with hot dogs,\ninstead suggesting beer, soda, lemonade, or ice tea. We would say\nhot dogs go fine with anything but wine.\n\n   The origins of the frankfurter are in dispute. Was it born in\nGermany in Frankfurt am Main or in Austria in Vienna? Scholars\ndisagree only slightly less vehemently than the two cities do.\n\n   On this side of the Atlantic, debate flourishes over the\naddition of the bun. Were sausages in a roll first served in New\nYork City's Bowery during the 1860s by a German immigrant operating\na pushcart? Or were they initially offered at a Coney Island stand\nin 1871? And what about the story that the first hot dog on a bun\nwas served at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis? Or the one about\nthe editorial cartoonist who coined the term ``hot dog'' after he\nsaw wieners served in buns at New York's Polo Grounds ballpark in\n1901?\n\n   If you want to impress your friends while standing around the\nbackyard grill this summer, tell them stuff like this:\n\n   _If Americans will indeed eat 20 billion hot dogs this year,\nthat's about 75 for every man, woman, and child in the country.\n\n   _Major league baseball fans are expected to eat 26 million hot\ndogs at ballparks in 1998, only a few more than Babe Ruth allegedly\nate at a single sitting.
