(Eds: See related story ABORTION-DOCTOR) \n(af) \n By JOHN KIFNER  \nc.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material\nwitness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to\nabortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester,\nand law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several\ntimes in demonstrations at abortion clinics.\n\n   The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records,\nstudies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts\nof protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant\nprotester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly\nabrasive protests at abortion clinics.\n\n   Federal law enforcement officials say he is not currently a\nsuspect in the Slepian shooting, and there was no indication\nWednesday that he had been arrested for any violent acts. At\nseveral abortion protests, he was charged with trespassing or\nresisting arrest, according to news accounts.\n\n   One of his arrests was in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge\nanti-abortion protests there in 1988. While he was in an Atlanta\njail, Kopp was given the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators\ncontend links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion\nmovement, responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven\nmurders of abortion providers like Slepian over the last five\nyears.\n\n   Responsibility for some of the violence _ like the bombing of an\nabortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier this year, in which an\noff-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed in notes signed by\na shadowy ``Army of God.''\n\n   An underground manual issued in the name of the Army of God,\nwhich describes methods for attacking abortion clinics, including\nhow to make homemade C-4 plastic explosives, begins with a tribute,\nby nickname, of a clandestine band pledged to stop abortions.\n\n   The first name under this ``Special Thanks'' section is Atomic\nDog.\n\n   The Atlanta police, after searching the hundreds of arrest\nrecords of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed\nWednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number\nof the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday\nby the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of\nSlepian, who was gunned down through the window if his home in\nsuburban Amherst on Oct. 23.\n\n   At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that the FBI\ngave as Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who gave\nhis name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp\nwell.\n\n   He lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents,\nwho were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of\nprotesters who tried to shut down two abortion clinics in\nBurlington in stubborn demonstrations that year.\n\n   Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice guy,'' who did chores\naround the place but paid no rent to the parents. He sometimes made\nwooden toys or played video games with Kenny, then a child.\n\n   ``But the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement,''\nKenny recalled. ``He was known among these people as Atomic Dog. It\nwasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But\nif you knew anything about him, that's what you called him.''\n\n   Roughly 95 people were arrested during the protests, according\nto newspaper accounts at the time.\n\n   ``There were many, many arrests,'' recalled Allie Stickney, the\npresident of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. ``It was\nvery big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite locks and leaflets from\nthe Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It was clearly a highly\norganized blockade.''\n\n   According to newspaper accounts, Kopp was arrested outside a\nclinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991.\n\n   The protests in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point\nfor a hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police cracked\ndown hard and carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated\nprison dormitory the called ``the farm.''\n\n   Operation Rescue had mounted a series of blockades to close down\nabortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia that spring. Atlanta\nwas their high point, but in the face of the tough arrest policy,\nthe movement faltered, split apart and stalled.\n\n   ``It was a traumatic, life-changing experience,'' said Frederick\nClarkson, author of ``Eternal Hostility,'' a book on the\nanti-abortion movement, adding that by 1993 with the shooting of\nDr. David Gunn, an abortion provider in Florida, some of those in\nthe Atlanta jail became the nucleus of a group signing a\n``justifiable homicide'' statement that declared that the use of\nforce was warranted to ``defend the life of an unborn child.''\n","Headline":"\nRECORDS PORTRAY WITNESS AS AVID ABORTION PROTESTER \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material\nwitness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to\nabortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester,\nand law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several\ntimes in demonstrations at abortion clinics.\n","\n   The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records,\nstudies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts\nof protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant\nprotester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly\nabrasive protests at abortion clinics.\n","\n   Federal law enforcement officials say he is not currently a\nsuspect in the Slepian shooting, and there was no indication\nWednesday that he had been arrested for any violent acts.
