Ron Wilson, D-Houston, said spending that much money\n``is excessive, beyond what probably is needed.''\n\n   But even if that amount is needed, Wilson said, a commission\nappointed by the school should not head the investigation. Instead,\nthe work should be done by an independent law enforcement agency,\nhe said.\n\n   ``If this was Texas Southern University and the same event had\noccurred on that campus, it would be crawling with federal and\nstate and local officials looking at it,'' Wilson said. ``But A&M\nhas some politics on its side.''\n\n   TSU is a largely black state university in Houston with about\n7,000 students. More than 43,000 students attend Texas A&M at\nCollege Station.\n\n   State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, whose district includes the A&M\ncampus, said Wilson is ``just flat wrong.'' Ogden is vice chairman\nof the Senate Education Subcommittee on Higher Education.\n\n   ``Trying to drag Texas Southern and the racial issue into this\nis totally inappropriate,'' Ogden said.\n\n   ``Secondly, A&M has no choice,'' he said. ``If they appoint an\nindependent commission and do not give them the assets they need,\nit compromises the public perception.''\n\n   In response to Wilson's comments, Texas A&M President Ray Bowen\nreleased a statement that read:\n\n   ``We share Representative Wilson's concern about the cost. We,\ntoo, wish it didn't cost so much. We obviously wish, of course, the\ntragedy had never occurred.''\n\n   Wilson's comments came a day after special commission Chairman\nLeo Linbeck Jr. informed school officials that another $1 million\nmight be needed to complete an investigation. He also said the\ncommission will miss the March 31 deadline set by Bowen. The new\ngoal is the first week of May.\n\n   ``We want to keep it at a high level of confidence so people are\nsure we didn't leave anything out,'' Linbeck said. ``The gravity of\nthe tragedy and the injuries that ensued make it important that we\npursue the truth.''\n\n   Last November, university officials appointed Linbeck to head\nthe special panel to determine why the 59-foot tower collapsed\nbefore completion. The accident was the most tragic in the 90-year\ntradition of the bonfire, which is burned before the annual\nfootball game with the University of Texas.\n\n   Documents released by the school indicated that on Dec. 5, A&M\nofficials expected to spend $225,000 on the investigation.\n\n   In January, after talking with consultants, Linbeck estimated\nthe cost would be about $500,000 to hire four firms to determine\nwhat happened.\n\n   Last month, A&M regents said they would spend as much as $1\nmillion for the investigation, but they wanted to sign off on any\nexpenditures above that amount.\n\n   On Wednesday, Linbeck told university officials the budget is\n$1.67 million. However, he wants as much as $2 million needed.\n\n   The money for the investigation is coming from university\ninvestments, rather than tax dollars from the state's general\nrevenue fund. The university invests income from student fees and\nother non-tax generated monies, and that income may be used for any\nlawful purpose.\n\n   In the days just after the tragedy, the school spent $292,000,\nincluding about $90,000 to send students and administrators to\nfunerals.\n\n   University regents have indicated they will approve the budget\nincrease Linbeck wants. The Houston construction magnate, who is an\nalumnus of the University of Notre Dame, said the extra money\nlargely is needed to complete interviews with more witnesses and\nofficials.\n\n   In addition, the companies handling the investigation want\nfinancial protection should they be dragged into any ensuing\nlawsuits.\n\n   Despite criticism from Wilson, other lawmakers who oversee the\nstate's second-largest university said they had no problem with the\n$2 million figure or the fact that the school is investigating\nitself.\n\n   Texas Senate Education Chairman Teel Bivins said A&M is taking\nthe same approach that Johnson & Johnson did when the company faced\na scare that its product, Tylenol, was laced with cyanide.\n\n   ``Johnson & Johnson spared no expense to investigate their\nproduct and the company did everything in the open,'' Bivins said.\n``It appears to me that Texas A&M is doing the same thing.''\n\n     \n(STORY CAN END HERE.
