Bush plans to create a\nnational commission that would examine controversies that have\narisen in law enforcement and the criminal justice system in recent\nyears.\n\n   The commission could result in sweeping changes not seen since\n1967, the last time a U.S. president convened such a group, several\nlaw enforcement officials and legal experts said.\n\n   Democratic candidate Al Gore did not commit to establishing a\ncommission but would deal with problems in a strong fashion if he\nsaw evidence that action was needed, said Alex Zaroulis, Gore's\nMissouri spokeswoman.\n\n   Bush and Gore issued statements to The Kansas City Star in\nresponse to questions the newspaper posed about drug forfeiture\nabuses and in response to a call from the International Association\nof Chiefs of Police for a commission.\n\n   The police chiefs association asked the presidential candidates\nto support a national commission to investigate perceived police\nand criminal justice abuses. One of those issues, the association\nhas said, is drug forfeiture.\n\n   Col. Michael D. Robinson, president of the police chiefs\nassociation and director of the Michigan State Police, said law\nenforcement in America today has lost the public's trust and\nconfidence.\n\n   ``We stand at a critical point in our history,'' Robinson said.\n``We in many cities have worse tensions between police and the\ncommunity than at any other time in recent history.''\n\n   Ray Sullivan, Bush's deputy press secretary, said the Republican\ncandidate expected the commission ``to evaluate changing demands\nand challenges facing law enforcement and our justice system.''\n\n   In recent years the reputation of law enforcement and the\ncriminal justice system has been hammered coast to coast from such\ncontroversies as illegal seizures, racial profiling, forced\nconfessions from suspects, and police beatings and shootings.\n\n   Several aspects of the judicial system also have come under\nfire, such as the death penalty and crowded prisons.\n\n   Gene Voegtlin, legislative counsel for the police chiefs\nassociation, said the organization was pleased with Bush's support,\nadding that the association hoped Gore, too, would respond to keep\nthe issue bipartisan.\n\n   Drug forfeitures were the subject of a series of stories The\nStar published in May showing police across the country were\nevading state laws to improperly keep millions of dollars in cash\nand property seized in drug busts and traffic stops.\n\n   Most states have laws that prohibit police from directly\nbenefiting from seizures in drug cases, because they see that as a\ndangerous conflict of interest. Several states send the money to\npublic education. But police are able to keep much of the money by\nhanding seizures off to federal agencies, which keep a portion and\nreturn up to 80 percent to police.\n\n   Critics fear that allowing police to profit from fighting crime\ncan lead to other abuses such as racial profiling.\n\n   ``Part of what is driving some of the racial-profiling problem\nis this economic motivation to make large numbers of (traffic)\nstops,'' said John Crew, director of the Campaign Against Racial\nProfiling arm of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n   Vice President Gore's state, Tennessee, has some of the least\nstringent state forfeiture laws in the country. Even so, the\nMemphis Police Department has been under investigation by a number\nof agencies, including the FBI and the state auditor, for\ncorruption in its handling of drug money. Last month four\nhigh-ranking employees were fired.\n\n   Gore supports existing forfeiture laws, as well as more funding\nfor both law enforcement and education, Zaroulis said.\n\n   The Star found that in Texas, where Bush is governor, police\npublicly acknowledge that they bypass state law and use federal\nlaw, which makes it easier for them to forfeit money and keep much\nof it.\n\n   Robinson said the police chiefs association began considering a\nnational commission as a result of its research into the\nracial-profiling controversy that has exploded across the country\nin recent years.\n\n   ``It did not take us long to recognize that there are issues\nthat affect the public's confidence in the entire criminal justice\nsystem,'' Robinson said.\n\n   The 1967 national commission under President Lyndon B. Johnson\nwas effective, Robinson said.\n\n   The commission worked a year and a half, producing 200 specific\nrecommendations involving all levels of government, as well as\ncivic, business and religious organizations, according to the\npolice chiefs association.\n\n   ``The commission and its recommendations marked the beginning of\na sea change in our methods for dealing with crime and the public,\nand built the framework for many of the exemplary programs that\ncontinue today,'' according to the police chiefs association.\n\n   The recommendations came at a time of rioting in many major\ncities, increasing police brutality and high crime rates.\n\n   Among the recommendations were community policing, better\nfingerprint recognition systems and a single, uniform police\ntelephone number, which has evolved into 911, officials for the\npolice chiefs association said.\n\n   A recommendation for a national commission was met with praise\nfrom many organizations around the country, but at the same time\nthey cautioned that it should not become another blue-ribbon\ncommittee report that is quickly shelved.\n\n   For example, Eric Sterling, president of The Criminal Justice\nPolicy Forum in Washington and former counsel for the House\nJudiciary Committee, said his organization has supported such a\ncommission for a number of years. But he cautioned that Congress\nauthorized a commission after the Ruby Ridge FBI standoff in Idaho,\nbut its report was a ``nonevent.''\n\n   Crew, who has worked on police reform issues for 15 years, said\nunless politicians find the will to stand up to law enforcement,\nthe commission recommendations would barely see daylight. He\npointed to the powerful anti-reform police organizations as a huge\nbarrier that politicians can't get over.\n\n   ``Police misconduct persists on a widespread basis in the United\nStates not because we don't know the solutions,'' Crew said. ``It's\nbecause we lack the political will to implement those solutions.\nThe question is whether a presidential commission would increase or\ndecrease that political will.''\n\n   But a commission could find it difficult to bridge the huge\nphilosophical divide over issues such as the war on drugs, said\nRoger Pilon, a constitutional expert and vice president for legal\naffairs with the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank.\n\n   As a result, some problems are ``simply intractable,'' said\nPilon, who nonetheless supports creation of such a commission.\n\n   The Forfeitures Endanger American Rights, a national\norganization that opposes the drug war, has endorsed the concept of\na commission but remains concerned that major issues such as police\ncorruption would not be addressed.\n\n   But the police chiefs association should be commended for taking\nsuch a controversial stand, said association member Joseph\nMcNamara, who was a police chief in San Jose and Kansas City and a\nnational expert in policing at the Hoover Institution.\n\n   ``I think it deserves credit for this kind of call for candid\nself-analysis,'' McNamara said.    tag1:To reach Karen Dillon, call\n(816) 234-4430 or send e-mail to kdillon   kcstar.com\n","Headline":"\nCANDIDATE WOULD CREATE A COMMISSION TO EXAMINE POLICE PROBLEMS \n","Text":["\n   If he is elected president, George W.
