Times News Service   \n\n   In a setback for the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission\nhas given the telecommunications industry an additional 20 months\nto comply with a federal law meant to bring law enforcement\nsurveillance into the digital age.\n\n   But in extending the deadline the commission deferred action on\nsome of the most disputed facets of the issue, which has pitted law\nenforcement officials against telephone equipment manufacturers,\nnetwork-service providers and privacy-rights advocates.\n\n   The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, passed by\nCongress in 1994, was intended to address complaints by the FBI and\nlocal law enforcement agencies that they were rapidly losing their\nability to conduct wiretaps and other forms of electronic\nsurveillance in the face of modern digital and wireless\ncommunications networks.\n\n   But industry groups had long warned that they would be unable to\nmeet the approaching Oct. 25 deadline for complying with the law by\ninstalling the software and hardware that would allow for\ncourt-authorized surveillance on modern networks. The FCC order,\nissued on Friday, extended the deadline to June 30, 2000.\n\n   Justice Department officials said they were tentatively pleased\nwith the ruling _ not by the delay, but by the setting of what they\nsaid they hoped would be a firm deadline, following months of\nuncertainty.\n\n   ``We're very heartened that a clear signal has been sent by the\nFCC,'' said Stephen Colgate, an assistant attorney general. ``There\nneeds to be some finality to this process.''\n\n   He would not comment, however, on the FCC's decision to defer\naction on other issues involving the new surveillance capabilities,\nsaying he had not yet had an opportunity to review the entire\norder.\n\n   The order leaves unresolved some questions raised by industry\nexecutives and privacy experts who had argued that the FBI was\nusing the law both to expand its wiretapping capabilities as well\nas add new capabilities like the ability to track the location of\ncellular telephone users and intercept Internet traffic.\n\n   ``This ruling is really a prelude to the privacy fight,'' said\nJames Dempsey, a telecommunications expert at the Center for\nDemocracy and Technology, a privacy rights group in Washington.\n``For now the commission has given itself and the industry some\nbreathing room. They've said, `Don't rush into these additional\nsurveillance areas.'''\n\n   The decision came in response to a request for a deadline\nextension that was filed in March in a joint petition by AT&T\nWireless Services, Lucent Technologies and Ericsson. Manufacturers\nare adding features to network switching equipment that permit a\ngreater number of simultaneous phone calls to be monitored by law\nenforcement officials and accommodate modern telephone calling\nfeatures like call forwarding and conference calling.\n\n   FCC officials deferred their decisions on expanding the\ncapabilities to include providing location information in cellular\ntelephone networks and embracing Internet packet-switching\ntechnology. But they did indicate their awareness that their\nrulings on such matters could have a significant impact on privacy\nrights in the future.\n\n   ``As we go forward with this important proceeding, we need to\nmake sure that law enforcement has the most up-to-date tools\navailable to catch criminals,'' William Kennard, the commission\nchairman, said in a statement. ``But we need to balance the needs\nof law enforcement with Americans' rights to privacy.''\n\n   One industry representative said Friday that he was pessimistic\nabout the possibility in the long run of limiting law-enforcement\nofficials' access to user-location data on wireless networks.\n\n   ``The market is going to create a demand for this, and when that\nhappens the FBI is going to have access to that information,'' said\nStewart Baker, a lawyer in Washington who represents the cellular\ntelephone industry.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The current privacy dispute centers on access to computer data\nthat will track a cellular telephone user's location only to the\nvicinity of the closest cellular network transmitter, which might\nbe hundreds of yards or even several miles away from the person.\n\n   But a number of companies are now at work on powerful\ntechnologies based on global positioning satellite, or GPS,\nreceivers _ as well as alternative approaches _ that might pinpoint\nthe user's location within 20 feet or so.\n\n   The FCC has already mandated that cellular systems begin\nproviding such precise locator data for 911 emergency purposes in\n2001. But manufacturers are taking various approaches to\nsafeguarding access to that information. Several of the systems,\nfor example, would generate the locator information only if the\ncell-phone user switched on that capability.\n\n   Surveillance of Internet data is also likely to become a heated\nprivacy issue as the FCC deliberations proceed. Because of the\nnature of packet-switched networks that blend thousands of\ncommunications streams, part of the quandary will be how to provide\nlaw enforcement with access to only the narrowly defined stream of\ndata specified in a subpoena.\n\n     \nNYT-09-13-98 1831EDT  \n","Headline":"\nA CALL FOR DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE IS DELAYED \n","Text":["\n   In a setback for the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission\nhas given the telecommunications industry an additional 20 months\nto comply with a federal law meant to bring law enforcement\nsurveillance into the digital age.\n","\n   But in extending the deadline the commission deferred action on\nsome of the most disputed facets of the issue, which has pitted law\nenforcement officials against telephone equipment manufacturers,\nnetwork-service providers and privacy-rights advocates.\n","\n   The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, passed by\nCongress in 1994, was intended to address complaints by the FBI and\nlocal law enforcement agencies that they were rapidly losing their\nability to conduct wiretaps and other forms of electronic\nsurveillance in the face of modern digital and wireless\ncommunications networks.\n","\n   But industry groups had long warned that they would be unable to\nmeet the approaching Oct. 25 deadline for complying with the law by\ninstalling the software and hardware that would allow for\ncourt-authorized surveillance on modern networks.
