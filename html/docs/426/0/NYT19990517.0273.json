Times News Service   \n\n   Internal Revenue Service tax collectors, under intense pressure\nfrom Congress to be nicer to taxpayers, have drastically scaled\nback efforts to collect unpaid taxes, newly available statistics\nshow.\n\n   Seizures of property are down 98 percent over the last two\nyears, according to the IRS. Levies and garnishments of bank\naccounts and paychecks are just one-fourth the level of two years\nago. And the filing of tax liens, which make sure that back taxes\nare paid when a property is sold, are down two-thirds.\n\n   Part of the drop-off in enforcement is because the IRS has been\nshifting some resources to pay for customer service, new computers\nand retraining. But IRS officers in six states said in interviews\nthat the biggest reason for the retreat was their fear of being\ndismissed for running afoul of a new law intended to protect\ntaxpayers from overzealous collectors.\n\n   Already, some tax preparers are telling clients that they can\nuse the law to thwart collection of overdue taxes altogether, IRS\nrevenue officers and outside tax experts said. One tax preparer,\nfor example, threatened to bring a harassment claim if a collection\nagent did not accept the preparer's terms for settling a case, said\nPhyllis Vidler, president of the National Treasury Employees Union\nlocal in Detroit, which represents IRS workers in Michigan.\n\n   Workers' fears prompted Charles O. Rossotti, the tax\ncommissioner, to send a memo with the March paychecks for the IRS's\n98,000 employees assuring them that their jobs were safe unless\nthey willfully abused taxpayers' rights. On May 5, Rossotti issued\nregulations aimed at carrying out the new law.\n\n   The law says that IRS employees must be dismissed if, following\nan administrative inquiry, they are found to have committed any of\n10 acts, among them violating any constitutional or civil right of\na taxpayer, threatening an audit for personal gain, making a false\nstatement under oath or falsifying or destroying documents to\nconceal mistakes. None of these provisions specify that conduct\nmust be willful, although others do, such as willfully cheating on\ntaxes or lying to Congress.\n\n   Tax experts who have worried that Congress overreacted to\ncomplaints about the IRS said that the drop in collection efforts\nwould lead to widespread tax evasion if some balance was not\nquickly restored to the political climate surrounding the agency.\n\n   ``It's a dumb law,'' said one critic, Donald C. Alexander, the\nNixon administration tax commissioner.\n\n   Alexander, now a Washington tax lawyer, said the fall-off in\ncollections was causing alarm among IRS executives. ``When someone\ncan fail to meet his or her tax obligations without a worry about\nhaving enforcement actions taken, then other creditors are going to\ncome in first and get paid, and the deadbeat taxpayer wins,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   A spokeswoman for William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican\nwho as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee was a principal\nsponsor of the new law, said he saw no problems with its\nrequirements.\n\n   ``Clearly the senator's intention was not to either frighten\ngood IRS employees or encourage tax evasion,'' said the\nspokeswoman, Ginny Flynn. ``His intention was to insure that IRS\nemployees do not treat either their colleagues or taxpayers\nunfairly and to ensure that the tax commissioner can deal with\nthem.''\n\n   Tax collectors who act properly have noting to fear, she added,\n``because the law requires proof, not just an accusation'' of a\nviolation.\n\n   The sharp decline in collections comes as the agency is in the\nmidst of a cultural revolution whose success, Rossotti has warned,\nis far from certain.\n\n   In addition to the problems of collection, many veteran auditors\nhave chafed, for example, at being pulled off examining tax returns\nto answer telephone calls from taxpayers. Other employees say that\nRossotti is naive and fails to realize how many taxpayers cheat,\nrequiring costly collection efforts.\n\n   Congress, meanwhile, has frozen the IRS budget just when\nRossotti is seeking billions of dollars to build new computer\nsystems, retrain the agency's staff and recruit managers from\noutside the government. Some of the money to finance these moves\nhas come from scaling back audits and collection efforts, officials\nacknowledge.\n\n   Rossotti, who ran a successful computer consulting firm before\njoining the government, gently suggested that IRS employees were\noverreacting to the new law.\n\n   ``I don't want to denigrate the fears and concerns of front-line\nemployees,'' he said, ``but the reality is that this law deals with\nwillful and serious misconduct.''\n\n   In the six months ended March 31, the IRS seized property to\nsatisfy long overdue taxes 108 times, down from 1,150 seizures in\nthe comparable period a year earlier and 5,000 seizures two years\nago.\n\n   Garnishments of paychecks and levies of bank accounts in the\nlatest six months fell to 458,000, down from 1.8 million two years\nearlier. Liens, which ensure that taxes are paid when property is\nsold, fell to 98,000, compared with 272,000 two years ago.\n\n   The IRS is expected to collect about $1.7 trillion this year,\nwith less than 2 percent, or about $30 billion, from enforcement\nactions such as issuing liens, levies and seizing property.\n\n   The IRS begins collection efforts after a taxpayer has failed to\npay taxes or to turn over taxes withheld from workers' paychecks.\nBut instead of stepping up pressure, one tax collector said, ``with\nthis new law if somebody says `I'm not paying,' then we just say\nthank you and leave.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   ``If I were a revenue officer today I would have great hesitance\nto take any enforcement action,'' said Alexander, the former IRS\ncommissioner.\n\n   Margaret Richardson, the Clinton administration's first tax\ncommissioner, said that ``there is a lot of healthy skepticism''\namong tax collectors about Rossotti's promise that only willful\nacts will result in dismissals.\n\n   Business owners who are habitually late turning over taxes\nwithheld from workers' paychecks also have begun using the law to\nderail collection of overdue taxes, said Mrs. Vidler, the union\nofficial, and other veteran tax collectors.\n\n   ``If you don't want to pay your taxes today all you have to do\nis say two magic words: installment agreement,'' said one IRS\ncollection officer in Washington state who spoke on condition of\nanonymity because he feared retaliation by supervisors.\n\n   ``You just say you want one, and even if the terms you propose\nare ridiculous _ like $10 a week when you owe tens of thousands _\ncollection stops while your proposal goes up and down the chain of\nmanagers, until 90 days later you are told no,'' the IRS employee\nsaid. ``Then you just need to say another magic word _ harassment _\nand because of this new law, the collection process stops while\nyour complaint gets reviewed.''\n\n   Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, noted that the provisions\nof the new law relating to agency employees' conduct were not among\nthose recommended by a congressional commission that he co-chaired\non reforming the IRS.\n\n   ``We need to change at least four or five of the 10 items in\nthis law, or reform just isn't going to work,'' Kerrey said,\n``because it creates a disincentive for IRS people to do their\njobs.''\n\n   One veteran tax collector in Manhattan said he and others were\ntroubled that the new law mandated dismissals for several acts even\nif willful misconduct was not proven _ including violations of the\nAge Discrimination Act of 1975 or ``falsifying or destroying\ndocuments to conceal mistakes.''\n\n   ``You say `intentional,' I say honest mistake,'' this tax\ncollector said. ``I'm not going to risk my job on that, and I don't\nbelieve anyone else would either.''\n\n   (Begin optional trim)\n\n   IRS agents and officials of their union point to the case of a\nrevenue officer in White Plains. The woman, they say, is under\ninvestigation by the Treasury Department's inspector general\nbecause her activity log failed to note whether she had included a\nparticular form in a delinquency notice she sent to a taxpayer. The\nnotice was returned by the post office as undeliverable because the\ntaxpayer had moved, said Frank Heffler, president of the local\nunion.\n\n   ``Nothing happened here but a simple mistake of no consequence,\nbut now there are two inspectors working on this, and the revenue\nofficer fears she will lose her job,'' he said. ``Given the trouble\nyou can get into over a work log, I don't know anyone who would\nexecute a property seizure and risk their job.''\n\n   (End optional trim)\n\n   Rossotti, the tax commissioner, said the new law ``did create a\nlot of concern and anxiety among many employees, understandably,\nbecause it affects every one of them and some of the provisions are\nrather complex.''\n\n   He said that in addition to his March memo, he is trying to\ninstill in IRS managers ``the difference between accidental versus\nintentional mistakes.''\n\n   Mrs. Richardson, the Clinton administration's first tax\ncommissioner, said tax collectors are responding to the signals\nsent by Rossotti.\n\n   ``The big message is in the new IRS mission statement, which\nsays nothing about collecting taxes,'' she said. ``That was a\npowerful message to the organization, to people who don't want to\npay and to unscrupulous tax professionals.''\n\n   The new mission statement, written by Rossotti, says that the\nIRS should ``provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by\nhelping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by\napplying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.''\n\n   Montie Day, a former IRS criminal investigator and federal\nprosecutor who now regularly sues the IRS on behalf of taxpayers,\nsaid that Rossotti should take forceful action to restore\ncollections.\n\n   ``Basically there is no enforcement going on right now, and that\nundermines the whole tax system,'' he said. ``And as word about\nthis gets out two things will happen: People who are inclined to\ncheat will say to themselves that since they aren't going to be\nmade to pay up, they should cheat.
