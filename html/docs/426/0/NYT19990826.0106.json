Bush doesn't\nwant to reveal any history he might have with cocaine, but as Texas\ngovernor he has not been reluctant to talk tough about hard drugs\nand stiffen the penalties for those who break drug laws.\n\n   Elected on a law-and-order platform in 1994, Bush has signed\nlaws that make it more likely that people convicted of possessing\nsmall amounts of cocaine will go to jail, drug felons won't be\nparoled, and drug dealers who sell to children or can be linked to\ndrug-related deaths will receive longer sentences.\n\n   ``Incarceration is rehabilitation,'' Bush said during his first\ngubernatorial campaign, and some critics in the field of criminal\njustice believe the governor has taken his own words to an extreme.\n\n   ``Governor Bush has taken a zero-tolerance approach to drugs in\nthe state of Texas,'' said Danny Easterling, a Houston lawyer who\nheads the 400-member Harris County Criminal Defense Lawyers\nAssociation. ``He has a `lock 'em up' mentality, as opposed to a\ngive-them-treatment mentality, that is very unfortunate. When you\napply that to cocaine possession, it has a lot of people's blood\nboiling.''\n\n   Bush's overall approach to criminals, and particularly to\nfirst-time drug felons, causes Texans like Easterling to question\nBush's much touted ``compassionate conservatism.'' Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz accuses Bush of ``rampant hypocrisy'' for\ncontemplating cutting welfare benefits to poor people who have\nabused drugs if, as a presidential candidate, he won't flatly deny\nthat he ever used hard drugs himself.\n\n   Bush has been dogged by the media to respond to unsubstantiated\nrumors that he has used cocaine, which is a felony in Texas.\nInitially, Bush cited his zone of privacy and refused to answer the\nquestion. Last week, when asked if he could pass an FBI background\ncheck for drugs, the governor indicated he had been drug-free for\nat least 25 years.\n\n   Each of the governor's eight rivals for the GOP nomination has\ndenied ever using illegal drugs. Some of them have suggested that\nBush's credibility on law enforcement issues hinges on giving a\ndirect answer to the drug question.\n\n   Instead, Bush's campaign message is that young people should\nstay away from illegal drugs, and as governor Bush has put more\nresources into preventing drug use than in treating drug addiction.\nThe candidate also has said that those who experiment with drugs\nshould learn from their mistakes and be forgiven, an attitude that\nseems at odds with some of his punitive policies back home.\n\n   ``The governor wants to make sure that when you commit a crime,\nthere is going to be a punishment, and it will be swift and sure,''\nsaid Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. ``It is his\nresponsibility to enforce the law.''\n\n   A Texas law that Bush signed in 1997 mandates that judges\nsentence first-time felons convicted of possessing a gram or less\nof cocaine to a minimum of 180 days and a maximum of two years in a\nstate jail. Under Bush's predecessor, Governor Ann Richards, such\nfirst-time offenders received automatic probation with drug\ncounseling.\n\n   Tony Fabelo, director of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy\nCouncil, said that in 1998, some 4,000 of the felons in state jails\nwere drug offenders, and approximately 2,800 of them had been\nincarcerated for possession of a gram or less of cocaine or heroin.\nStill, more than 80 percent of the drug felons who could have been\nsent to state jail had received probation instead, Fabelo said.\n\n   Easterling said that ``a lot of people are going to jail instead\nof receiving probation and rehabilitation'' for being found guilty\nof possessing cocaine in amounts that suggest personal use, not\ndrug dealing. The majority of those being jailed, he said, are\nminorities and the poor, who can't afford private attorneys and\ndon't get into treatment programs before their cases come to trial.\n``They are under a lot of pressure to plead guilty and move on,''\nEasterling said.\n\n   Fabelo confirmed that 58 percent of the drug felons in state\njails are black, 17 percent are Hispanic, and 23 percent are white.\nState jails in Texas house only nonviolent felons.\n\n   The Texas prison population _ as opposed its state jail\npopulation _ has tripled during the Bush administration to 149,000,\nmaking Texas second only to Louisiana in having the highest ratio\nof inmates, with more than 700 per 100,000 people. A $2 billion\nprison-building program started by Richards created so many prison\nbeds that Bush has been able to enhance his crime-fighter image by\nbacking tougher criminal sentencing and cracking down on parole.\n\n   In 1991, the parole board appointed by Richards granted parole\nto 79 percent of the eligible inmates. This year, under a\nBush-appointed parole board, the rate has fallen to an all-time low\nof 16 percent. The parole rate for drug offenders in prison is\nabout 20 percent.\n\n   ``The big old revolving door has shut,'' said Glen Castlebury, a\nspokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``Our\nparole board has flat out quit paroling people.''\n\n   Bill Habern, a criminal defense lawyer in Riverside, Texas, who\nspecializes in parole, says the parole rate proves that Bush is\nconservative, but not compassionate. ``There is no justification\nfor such an extreme reduction in parole, or for the damage . . . on\nthose who aren't released,'' Habern said. ``Bush is not tough on\ncrime, he is dictatorial on crime.''\n\n   Florence Shapiro, a Republican state senator from Plano, Texas,\nand a champion of antidrug legislation, says Bush is being unfairly\nbranded as a zealot on drug laws when they have been just a small\npiece of a larger crime-control package he has put forward as\ngovernor.\n\n   ``He believes in law and order, and he is committed to making\nthe streets safe, but the governor did not isolate drugs as his\nissue, or stand up and say, `This is what I stand for,' '' said\nShapiro, noting that Bush's greatest influence has been on\noverhauling the state's juvenile justice system, which, she said,\n``had been coddling bad boys for too long.''\n\n   Bush signed two drug bills that Shapiro wrote: One toughens the\npenalties on felons convicted of dealing drugs within 1,000 feet of\na school. A second lengthens the prison term for dealers who sell\ndrugs to someone who dies of an overdose.\n\n   Critics accuse Bush of slashing substance-abuse treatment\nprograms in Texas prisons. But authorities in the state say the\n14,000 treatment beds proposed by the Richards administration in\n1991 never materialized because the corrections department could\nnot demonstrate the need, not because Bush opposed rehabilitation.\n``It has been proven that 5,800 beds was and is the correct number,\nand that Texas is doing the optimum with what we all want done,''\nFabelo said.\n\n   But Morgan Reynolds, director of criminal justice studies for\nthe Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, a\nconservative think tank, says Bush faces a personal dilemma with\nhis antidrug record and the cocaine rumors.\n\n   ``Bush's message has been, `Be tough on crime, punishment works,\nand people need to take responsibility for their own actions,' ''\nReynolds said. ``I don't think it works when that man, who wants to\nbe the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, looks like he\nis hiding a felony crime.
