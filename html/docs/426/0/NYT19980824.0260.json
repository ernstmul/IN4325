Luper said you can\nadd to that, ``Never shock your dog either.\n\n   ``The only time I've used them is for poison-proofing or\nsnake-proofing,'' Luper said.\n\n   Shock collars are commonly used to teach dogs to stay clear of\nsnakes. They're also used in the training of retrievers and other\nhunting dogs.\n\n   Luper said shock collars should not be used as a substitute for\nmore in-depth, general obedience training.\n\n   ``I think the dog's main motivation to listen should be\nanticipation of the praise and affection that he'll receive for\nlistening,'' Luper said. ``I don't like the idea of a dog listening\nbecause he's afraid of the shock he'll get if he doesn't.''\n\n   Luper said that in the hands of an inexperienced dog trainer, a\ndevice such as a shock collar can become traumatic to the dog.\n\n   ``True, a shock collar can provide a correction at a distance,''\nLuper said. ``But if you want a dog to come and you don't use the\ncollar correctly, it can have the reverse effect. If you use the\nshock when he's running away from you, he just might run away\nfaster.''\n\n   If your dog doesn't come when you call him, Luper said, you\nshould work on modifying your relationship with your pet instead of\njust shocking him for not coming.\n\n   Some breeds, according to Luper, don't respond well to shock,\nanyway.\n\n   ``Pit bulls are virtually immune to pain,'' Luper said.\n``Rottweilers are also less sensitive to pain than other breeds.''\n\n   Luper said that although he doesn't have firsthand experience,\nhe has heard good things about devices that use audio or smell\ncorrections, such as citronella spray, in place of shock.\n\n   Phoenix area animal psychologist Kay Cox, a k a the Pet\nCounselor, said that she has used shock collars and that they can\nbe an effective training device for some dogs.\n\n   ``A dog with an attitude needs tough love,'' Cox said. ``You\nhave to find the right combination of whatever it takes to make\nthat animal recognize you as the leader in order to communicate\nwith him.''\n\n   Cox said the more traditional choke-chain and leash-training\nmethods can also be painful if done incorrectly.\n\n   ``A lot of trainers train completely wrong,'' Cox said. ``A\ngood, hard yank with a leash hurts. You do that, you aren't\nteaching them; you're controlling them.''\n\n   Cox said a key to using a shock collar is to leave it on the dog\nfor a few days before activating it so the dog doesn't associate\nthe correction with the trainer.\n\n   ``A shock collar works because it doesn't have to do with you,''\nCox said. ``Because there isn't a leash between you and the dog,\nthere is no one the dog can be resentful of when the correction is\nmade. It's like God strikes him. It can definitely wake up some\ndogs.''\n\n   But Cox, too, concedes that shock collars are not necessary in\nmost situations. She estimates that only about 1 percent of pups\nunder 8 weeks old demonstrate the kind of aggression and dominance\nthat may eventually merit such non-traditional training methods.\n\n   Veterinarian Mark Trueblood of Apollo Animal Hospital in\nGlendale, Ariz., said he does not hesitate to recommend using\nremote trainers.\n\n   ``If you have a situation where a dog is a problem barker and\nyou've tried other methods, using a no-bark collar is certainly a\nbetter alternative than taking the dog to the pound or having it\neuthanized.''\n\n   Trueblood said he is not aware of any physical damage caused by\nremote trainers if used correctly.  \n","Headline":"\nSHOCK COLLARS UNLEASH CONTROVERSY AMONG EXPERTS \n","Text":["\n   UNDATED - Shock collars, as you might expect, are not\nuniversally embraced.
