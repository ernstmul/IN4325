Times News Service clients)  \n By WILLIAM HERMANN  \n and DENNIS WAGNER  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Rick doesn't like the way Joe runs his jails.\n\n   Joe says Rick is just jealous because people like him better.\n\n   Joe is mad because he thinks Rick snitched on him to Uncle Sam.\n\n   Rick is upset because Joe accused him of being a lousy lawyer.\n\n   And so it goes in the political sand-kicking between the\nValley's two top law officers, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and County\nAttorney Richard Romley.\n\n   For five years they've been at each other's throats, publicly\nand privately sabotaging one another with venomous determination.\nBut the feud boiled over last week following recent clashes over\nthe arrest of a hairdresser, a postal worker pepper-spraying a dog,\nand a plan to bust people who steal off-road vehicles.\n\n   Those are the latest episodes in a soap-operatic feud between\ntwo elected officials who not only wield tremendous power but also\nare among Arizona's most influential politicians.\n\n   Arpaio, a former Drug Enforcement Administration special agent\nturned travel agent, won election after his predecessor was accused\nof badly botching an investigation into the massacre of nine people\nat a Buddhist temple.\n\n   Romley, an Arizona native and ex-Marine who lost both legs above\nthe knee in Vietnam, first took office as county attorney nearly 10\nyears ago.\n\n   Both are aggressive crime fighters and savvy politicians who are\nadept at using the media.\n\n   Both grant that the public is the big loser in their fight.\n\n   But neither will back down.\n\n   Last week, the sheriff sat in his downtown Phoenix office and\nerupted at the mention of Romley.\n\n   ``It's jealousy!'' Arpaio said loudly. ``The polls always have\nme at an 80 or 90 percent approval rating. The polls don't even\nshow he is respected by the voters!''\n\n   A few blocks away, on another day, Romley countered: ``Joe takes\neverything personally. But also, I'm not sure Joe understands the\nlaw or knows a great deal about law enforcement. When was his last\nmajor case?\n\n   ``What he has are gimmicks: pink underwear.''\n\n   Other law-enforcement officials want no part of this fight,\ndeclining to be quoted. Privately, however, they say Arpaio vs.\nRomley is a big, embarrassing distraction.\n\n   ``They're obsessed with each other,'' said one top law officer.\n``They can't even be in the same room together. . . . The problem\nis, they don't trust each other.''\n\n   One example: Arpaio, who has been besieged with death threats in\nthe past year, asked Attorney General Grant Woods to investigate\nrather than Romley, who would normally take the case.\n\n   Aside from isolated cases, insiders say the conflict has not\ndeterred sheriff's deputies and county prosecutors from cooperating\nto catch and convict criminals.\n\n   Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said Arpaio and Romley have great\nstaffs, and the bosses' quibbling doesn't filter into day-to-day\nwork.\n\n   ``They're both really good people,'' Wilcox added. ``It's sad\nthat they can't seem to get along. But it doesn't seem to effect\ntheir work.''   \nBONES OF CONTENTION\n\n   Flash points between Romley and Arpaio have ranged from trivial\nto serious:\n\n   In 1993, the sheriff announced he was going to ``surround the\ncounty'' with roadblocks and search vehicles for drugs. Romley\npublicly denounced the plan as unconstitutional, forcing the Arpaio\nto back off.\n\n   _In 1996, Romley called for a state audit of the sheriff's Jail\nEnhancement Fund based on allegations of inappropriate spending.\nAmong other things, Romley said Arpaio should not have used $39,000\nfor private legal counsel to sue the Board of Supervisors over his\nbudget.\n\n   Arpaio suggests that Romley ratted on him to the U.S. Justice\nDepartment, prompting a two-year investigation of alleged inmate\nabuse and civil-rights violations in Maricopa County jails. That\ncase ended this year with a settlement between Arpaio and the U.S.\nAttor ney's Office.\n\n   Romley believes Arpaio's inves tigators bungled the probe into\nthe 1996 death of jail inmate Scott Norberg. Arpaio accuses Romley\nof delaying resolution of an investiga tion into Norberg's death.\n\n   The sheriff claims that an inves tigative staff at Romley's\noffice constitutes a force of ``secret po lice.'' But Romley said\nhis investi gators do such work as looking into actions by other\nlaw enforcement agencies.\n\n   He also says Romley endangered law officers with critical\ncomments in a radio interview during a 1996 riot in the Tent City\njail.\n\n   _Romley criticized Arpaio after the case of military impostor\nDavid Michael Pecard, who had deserted the Army and was arrested in\n1996 after conning his way into the Sheriff's Office. Charges\nagainst Pecard were dismissed because sher iff's officers violated\nhis civil rights in Tent City by eavesdropping on phone\nconversations with his lawyer.   \nPetty issues\n\n   While those disputes involve major issues, the conflicts have\ngrown increasingly petty.\n\n   A few weeks ago, after Arpaio and a top aide got into a fight\nwith an intoxicated hairdresser, the sher iff said he couldn't rely\non Romley for ``fair and impartial prosecu tion.'' He tried to get\nthe county attorney to withdraw, but Romley refused.\n\n   Last week, Arpaio announced plans to pull over off-road vehicles\nin an effort to stop a spree of theft. Romley's office promptly\ndeclared the idea unconstitutional: ``The answer is no,'' said\nspokesman Bill FitzGerald. ``You can't just pull over vehicles for\nrandom searches.''\n\n   Romley also irked the sheriff by refusing to file animal-cruelty\ncharges against mailman Wayne Bates for using pepper spray on a\nfenced dog. Arpaio, who had used Bates' arrest as an opportunity to\npublicize his pet-protecting posse, was livid.\n\n   So was his publicity director, Lisa Allen. ``This man Romley!''\nshe fumed. ``He won't prosecute Bates because it will make Sheriff\nArpaio look good. But he'll take cases . . . where he hopes Sheriff\nArpaio will look like a big creep.''\n\n   Back at his office, Romley sighed.\n\n   ``This dog case, I mean _ Let it go, Joe! Yes, I think the\nmailman overreacted, but to put him in jail? Come on.''\n\n   Much of the conflict seems to involve a question of allegiance.\n``The county attorney is supposed to be my attorney,'' Arpaio says.\n``But he has been unethical and is always critical of me.''\n\n   Last March, Arpaio's office filed a state Bar complaint against\nRom ley, accusing him of a ``blatant conflict of interest'' because\nhe continually spoke out against sher iff's employees.\n\n   Romley, whose credits include the AzScam political-corruption\nsting and his order to release four Tucson men falsely accused of\nthe Buddhist temple murders, said he is confident the complaint\nwill be dismissed.\n\n   ``I am not his personal attorney. I have an obligation to speak\nout when I see problems, and he's trying to muzzle me with this,\nand I refuse to be,'' Romley said.\n\n   Much of the dispute arises from problems in the Maricopa County\njail system.\n\n   Arpaio says Romley publicly un dercut him during the riots two\nyears ago.\n\n   ``He was being interviewed on KTAR during the riot, and he\ncouldn't even wait until after the riot to get me,'' Arpaio said.\n``. . . I think it's almost criminal what he did.''\n\n   Romley's explanation: ``I was on the radio, and when they asked\nme about the situation I said we in law enforcement have been\nconcerned about the jails. I wasn't trying to make it more\ndifficult for the sheriff, just to tell the truth.''\n\n   Romley said he believes the riot was started ``by a guard who\noverreacted with a prisoner.''\n\n   Aide Barnett Lotstein added: ``The guard pepper sprayed a guy\nwho was on the toilet.''\n\n   As for the sheriff's complaints about Romley's legal work,\nRomley said, ``We are the people's lawyer, not Joe Arpaio's lawyer.\nHe doesn't understand the role of the county attorney. I don't work\nfor him. I work for the public.''\n\n   While the sheriff and prosecutors shoot it out, other law\nofficers steer clear of cross fire.\n\n   One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``As long as Joe\nis in there you will see problems between his outfit and other\nagencies: He just marches to a different drummer.''\n\n   Another noted that Romley wields considerable power. ``Every\nagency wants to have a good working relationship with Romley's\noffice. I can't imagine them fooling with our lower-level cases.\nBut if they are angry at you, they could scrutinize reports to\ndeath, nitpick them to the nth degree, beyond what is reasonable.''\n\n   Arpaio and Romley agree on one thing: The 1996 death of inmate\nNorberg marked the end of their cordiality. A drug user who was\narrested for assault, Norberg suffocated during a scuffle with\nguards in the Madison Street Jail.\n\n   ``I think the relationship with Joe began to break with the\nissue of brutality in the jails,'' Romley said. ``I was getting a\ndozen letters a week with specific examples of brutality. We had\nvideo tapes. I prosecuted several of his detention officers. Then,\nwith the Norberg incident, the problems elevated to a new level.\n\n   ``His investigation co-mingled a criminal investigation with an\ninternal investigation, and was poorly done.''\n\n   But Arpaio aide Jack MacIntyre said there was no mixing of\ninternal and a criminal investigations.\n\n   ``The investigation wasn't either of those things,'' MacIntyre\nsaid. ``It was what we call a `critical incident investigation.'\nThere was no indication of criminal conduct.''\n\n   Romley had refused to close the Norberg investigation until a\n$30 million civil suit filed by family members was resolved. Last\nweek, with the case still pending, he decided to open a criminal\ninvestigation of detention officers. Arpaio was outraged.\n\n   ``Why in two and a half years has not one of my employees been\ncleared in the Norberg case?'' asked the sheriff. ``How long must\nthis take?''\n\n   Arpaio also suspects Romley of treachery in the 1995 jail\ninvestigation by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n   ``I don't trust him,'' Arpaio said.\n\n   Looking dramatically toward the ceiling, he added, ``Now, who\nasked the Justice Department to come in?'' The sheriff shrugged,\nthen smiled knowingly.\n\n   MacIntyre said, ``When the Department of Justice looked at the\njails there was supposed to be an attorney-client relationship\nbetween Romley's office and us. But Romley handed out copies of\nthat report like a deck of cards.''\n\n   ``I mean, Jesus H. Christ!'' Arpaio said, jumping up and\nthrusting his arms into the air. ``Romley has his own secret police\nforce! He has 60 of his own investigators! He even changed their\nbadges so it says Maricopa County Attorney's Police Force.''\n\n   Romley said he has investigators to follow up on police work _\nand to investigate law enforcement agencies, including the\nSheriff's Office.\n\n   ``He's not above the law, and every time I raise an issue that\nperhaps he doesn't like, he says it's just a pissing match,''\nRomley said.\n\n   Romley said he's getting weary of Arpaio's anger, ``his hunger\nfor publicity,'' his charges. But not especially surprised, because\nthere were hints early on.\n\n   ``Years ago I got a flavor of what it would be like with Joe\nwhen he wanted to surround the county with law officers and stop\nevery third car and look for drugs,'' Romley said. ``It definitely\nwould have violated the Constitution. I told him he couldn't do it,\nand he got very mad.''\n\n   MacIntyre said ``the tragedy of this thing'' is that relations\nbetween the two agencies are so bad that the public is being poorly\nserved.\n\n   ``With the threat of prosecution being dangled over detention\nofficers in the Norberg case, with investigators being smeared by\nRomley, it does nothing for a sense of trust between the two\noffices,'' he said.\n\n   Romley insists that most business between the two agencies is\ngoing on very well. But he also said he won't back down in the face\nof an angry Arpaio.\n\n   ``When Joe exceeds or misuses his power I'm going to call him on\nit,'' Romley said. ``Joe is not going to bully me.''  \n","Headline":"\nLAW WORK FOR COUNTY ATTORNEY, SHERIFF TAKES BACK SEAT TO FEUD \n","Text":["\n   Rick doesn't like the way Joe runs his jails.\n","\n   Joe says Rick is just jealous because people like him better.\n","\n   Joe is mad because he thinks Rick snitched on him to Uncle Sam.\n","\n   Rick is upset because Joe accused him of being a lousy lawyer.\n","\n   And so it goes in the political sand-kicking between the\nValley's two top law officers, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and County\nAttorney Richard Romley.\n","\n   For five years they've been at each other's throats, publicly\nand privately sabotaging one another with venomous determination.\nBut the feud boiled over last week following recent clashes over\nthe arrest of a hairdresser, a postal worker pepper-spraying a dog,\nand a plan to bust people who steal off-road vehicles.\n","\n   Those are the latest episodes in a soap-operatic feud between\ntwo elected officials who not only wield tremendous power but also\nare among Arizona's most influential politicians.\n","\n   Arpaio, a former Drug Enforcement Administration special agent\nturned travel agent, won election after his predecessor was accused\nof badly botching an investigation into the massacre of nine people\nat a Buddhist temple.\n","\n   Romley, an Arizona native and ex-Marine who lost both legs above\nthe knee in Vietnam, first took office as county attorney nearly 10\nyears ago.\n","\n   Both are aggressive crime fighters and savvy politicians who are\nadept at using the media.\n","\n   Both grant that the public is the big loser in their fight.\n","\n   But neither will back down.\n","\n   Last week, the sheriff sat in his downtown Phoenix office and\nerupted at the mention of Romley.\n","\n   ``It's jealousy!''
