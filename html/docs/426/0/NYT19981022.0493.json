Times News Service   \n\n   The Federal Communications Commission on Friday issued a\nproposed set of rules intended to settle a dispute over high-tech\nwiretapping that has pitted the FBI against the telecommunications\nindustry and privacy advocates.\n\n   The dispute centers on a 1994 law, the Communications Assistance\nfor Law Enforcement Act, which was intended to guarantee that\nlaw-enforcement officials would be able to continue telephone\nsurveillance as communications technologies evolved.\n\n   Carrying out the law has been stalled, however, while the FBI\nhas quarreled with the communications industry over cost and\nfeasibility and with privacy groups that contend that the law would\npermit broad new government surveillance powers.\n\n   Under the proposed rules, the FCC would give law enforcement\nsome concessions, including the ability to get certain information\nabout the location of a person using a cellular telephone. But the\nagency rejected some new capabilities requested by the FBI and\ndeferred a decision on other issues, including surveillance of\nInternet communications.\n\n   ``Congress sought to balance the needs of law enforcement\nagainst legitimate privacy and industry interests,'' William\nKennard, the FCC chairman, said in a statement. ``The differences\nthat remain are significant but by no means insurmountable.''\n\n   Industry executives praised the steps taken by the FCC, saying\nthat the new laws could have been carried out years ago if the FBI\nhad not insisted on broad and costly new powers.\n\n   The communications agency said that by granting law-enforcement\nofficials the ability to collect location information that is\nalready available to a telephone company they were stopping short\nof turning cellular telephones into tracking devices.\n","Headline":"\nFCC OFFERS RULES INTENDED TO SETTLE WIRETAPPING DISPUTE \n","Text":["\n   The Federal Communications Commission on Friday issued a\nproposed set of rules intended to settle a dispute over high-tech\nwiretapping that has pitted the FBI against the telecommunications\nindustry and privacy advocates.\n","\n   The dispute centers on a 1994 law, the Communications Assistance\nfor Law Enforcement Act, which was intended to guarantee that\nlaw-enforcement officials would be able to continue telephone\nsurveillance as communications technologies evolved.\n","\n   Carrying out the law has been stalled, however, while the FBI\nhas quarreled with the communications industry over cost and\nfeasibility and with privacy groups that contend that the law would\npermit broad new government surveillance powers.\n","\n   Under the proposed rules, the FCC would give law enforcement\nsome concessions, including the ability to get certain information\nabout the location of a person using a cellular telephone.
