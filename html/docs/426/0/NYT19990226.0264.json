Constantine said that corruption\nin elite Mexican antinarcotics units trained by the United States\nhas reached such a high level that American law enforcement\nagencies no longer trust their counterparts across the border.\n\n   ``The power of the Mexican criminal organizations has grown\nvirtually geometrically'' over the past five years, resulting in\ncorruption ``unparalleled to anything I've seen in 39 years of law\nenforcement,'' Constantine said.\n\n   The DEA chief's comments caused some members of Congress to\nquestion whether Mexico deserves certification.\n\n   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., issued a statement Friday questioning\nwhy the administration was rewarding Mexicans ``with U.S. trade and\nforeign aid when they are dramatically increasing their heroin\nproduction and significantly lowering their seizures of illegal\ndrugs.''\n\n   Mica is chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's\npanel on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources.\n\n   On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he\nwill consider asking the Senate to overturn the decision to certify\nMexico. He said of Mexican officials, ``They're not doing what\nthey're supposed to be doing on the drug wars.''\n\n   But on Friday Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy, said Mexico deserved\ncertification because its leaders are ``doing their best'' to\ncooperate with U.S. drug fighting efforts.\n\n   ``This process is about determination of leadership and how\nwilling a country's leaders are to work with the United States on\nstopping drug traffickers,'' he said.\n\n   The certification process, mandated by law, requires that the\nUnited States ``decertify'' countries that do not cooperate with\nAmerican antidrug efforts. Decertified countries are often hit with\neconomic penalties such as loss of U.S. aid.\n\n   Congress can overturn Clinton's decision by a majority vote in\nboth chambers within 30 days. But in the 13 years that the process\nhas been in effect, lawmakers have never reversed an administration\ndecision.\n\n   DEA and FBI officials estimate that about 65 percent of the\ncocaine entering the United States passes through Mexico and 29\npercent of the heroin used here was smuggled in by Mexican cartels.\n\n   Since 1997, the U.S. Departments of State and Defense have\nprovided the Mexican government with $92 million worth of\nequipment, training and aviation parts for counternarcotics,\naccording to the Government Accounting Office.\n\n   Despite the help, Rand R. Beers, assistant secretary of state\nfor international narcotics and law enforcement, told the Senate\npanel Wednesday that Mexican law enforcement has failed to inflict\nany damage on the country's drug organizations.\n\n   He said that last year Mexico failed to reduce the flow of drugs\nacross the border, made no significant increase in drug eradication\nand seizures, failed to extradite any major drug trafficker to the\nUnited States and allowed most drug lords to operate with impunity.\n\n   Mexican officials, while acknowledging corruption, have insisted\nthat their government has taken unprecedented steps to stem the\nflow of narcotics.\n\n   Of the 28 nations considered for certification this year, 26\nwere certified, including Colombia which failed to make the list in\n1996 and 1997. Afghanistan and Burma were decertified, as they were\nlast year. McCaffrey said the two nations supply more than 90\npercent of the world's supply of opium poppy.\n\n   He said Colombia faces ``the difficult challenge of acting\neffectively against drugs while it must simultaneously deal with\narmed insurgents who control vast tracts of drug producing\nterritory.''\n\n   Other major drug-producing countries certified Friday included\nIran, which was decertified last year, and Jamaica, Pakistan,\nThailand, Venezuela, Peru and Vietnam.\n\n   The administration considered decertifying Cambodia, Haiti,\nNigeria and Paraguay but decided instead to certify them because of\nAmerica's ``vital interests'' in them, the State Department said.\nLast year Haiti and Paraguay were certified.\n","Headline":"\nCLINTON CERTIFIES MEXICO'S DRUG-FIGHTING EFFORTS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Despite strong opposition on Capitol Hill and in\nsome parts of his own administration, President Clinton said Friday\nhe is certifying that Mexico is ``fully cooperating'' with the\nUnited States in combating narcotics trafficking.\n","\n   ``Mexico is cooperating with us in the battle for our lives,''\nClinton said in San Francisco.\n","\n   The president's decision came only two days after senior\nadministration officials told a special Senate panel that\ncorruption in Mexico has reached unprecedented levels and that the\nMexican government has made little progress in combating cocaine\ncartels.\n","\n   Yet in an address to California business leaders, Clinton\npraised Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, saying he was ``working\nhard to tackle the drug traffickers headlong.''\n","\n   ``He cannot win this battle alone,'' the president said. ``And\nneither can we.''\n","\n   Yet at the Senate hearing Wednesday, Drug Enforcement\nAdministration Director Thomas A.
