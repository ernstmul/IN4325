(That figure may include money\nfrom actual joint investigations, however, and all of that money\nmight not have been able to be forfeited under state laws.)  \n\n   In North Carolina, as in many of the other states, it's\ndifficult to determine how much money actually went to education\nbecause there is no statewide accounting.  \n\n   In Wake County _ the location of Raleigh, the state capital _\nthe sheriff refused to disclose the amount in his county, and a\nnumber of other officials didn't know.  \n\n   Michael Crowell, an attorney who works for the state board of\neducation, said he didn't know about the education drain until\nrecently, but now he plans to begin reviewing legal remedies to get\nforfeiture proceeds to schools.  \n\n   He criticized the police hand-offs, saying that ``mentality is\njust puzzling and troubling. It's atrocious.''  \n\n   Wisconsin officials also didn't know police were handing off\nseizures.  \n\n   ``I don't know where they think, without a constitutional\namendment, they can get away with unilaterally making that type of\ndecision,'' said Calvin Potter, an assistant superintendent for the\nWisconsin Department of Public Instruction and a state legislator\nfor 23 years.  \n\n   But Wisconsin law enforcement officials freely admit they hand\noff seizures to federal agencies so they can get the money back.  \n\n   In Nebraska, voters changed the constitution in the 1980s to let\npolice have half the forfeiture money, which previously had all\ngone to education. Legislators say the change came at the request\nof law enforcement.  \n\n   But now police in Nebraska say they need all the money. And for\nseveral years, they have been turning the majority of seizures over\nto a federal agency rather than filing under state law.  \n\n   Police in Missouri also use the federal hand-off to keep money\ninstead of sending it to schools.  \n\n   Situations differ in other states:  \n\n   -- In West Virginia, the constitution requires any property\nseized to go to the school fund. But in 1988, state Sen. Lloyd\nJackson, then the Judiciary Committee chairman, co-sponsored a bill\nthat said forfeitures under the state forfeiture act aren't the\nsame as those in the state constitution. Other laws were passed\ndirecting forfeiture proceeds to a special law enforcement fund.  \n\n   Today, Jackson is the Education Committee chairman. An aide said\nJackson was too busy to be interviewed and cannot remember why he\nsponsored the law.  \n\n   (Some police still hand off seizures.)  \n\n   -- In Indiana, too, the legislature has passed a law helping\npolice to bypass schools with their seizures.  \n\n   -- Washington state's constitution sends forfeited money to the\nstate to be used for education. But state law conflicts with the\nconstitution, sending the money instead to the law enforcement\nagency that makes the seizure.  \n\n   -- In Wyoming, police may not purposely be avoiding the\nconstitutional education provision. It's just that no one knows\nabout it, according to the attorney general's office.  \n\n   Beyond the education drain, courts in two states have ruled that\nmoney can't be forfeited _ at all _ when the owner is convicted of\na crime.  \n\n   State supreme courts in New Mexico and Nebraska say it's double\njeopardy to both convict a person and take his property.  \n\n   But police are getting around those decisions by using federal\nagencies.  \n\n   Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the Albuquerque police special\ninvestigations unit, said police officials are working with\nprosecutors to find a way to overturn the New Mexico ruling.  \n\n   Davalos said the court is forgetting the whole point of\nforfeitures, which is to financially hurt drug traffickers.  \n\n   In the meantime, he said, a gentlemen's agreement has been\nworked out with the U.S. attorney's office and federal agencies to\nhandle the seizures that meet federal guidelines.  \n\n   ``It's a case-by-case basis,'' Davalos said. ``If we find a\nfriendly federal agency that is willing to do it for us, we more\nthan press them into service, be it the DEA, ATF, IRS.  \n\n   ``We don't really care.''  \n\n   Last year the Nebraska Supreme Court also ruled that some\nforfeitures are double jeopardy.  \n\n   Maj. Gale T. Griess of the Highway Patrol said troopers are\ncontinuing to hand off seizures to the federal government to try to\nkeep crime under control.  \n\n   ``If the seizures go by the wayside, basically what is going to\nhappen is the criminal element out there in society is going to\nhave the upper hand,'' he said.  \n\n   The legislature failed this spring to fix the double jeopardy\nproblem or force police to follow state law, which gives half of\nstate forfeitures to education.  \n\n   Several other states have even more unusual laws:  \n\n   -- Arkansas puts a cap on seizures.  \n\n   Police can keep up to $250,000 of a seizure. Anything more than\nthat must go into a statewide fund that benefits all local and\nstate law enforcement.  \n\n   But police have ignored the cap _ as state officials learned\nafter a $3.16 million seizure by the Arkansas Highway Police in\nMarch 1998. A county prosecutor went looking for the money,\ndiscovered the Highway Police had passed it to the Drug Enforcement\nAdministration and won a court ruling to get it back.  \n\n   After losing before the state Supreme Court, Highway Police\nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the\ncase.  \n\n   Highway Police lost their hold on the money.  \n\n   Meanwhile, legislators discovered that the fund set up for all\nforfeitures over $250,000 was empty.  \n\n   -- In Georgia, local police can keep almost all the money they\nseize _ and state police can't keep any.  \n\n   But state police make sure they get at least a share.  \n\n   First, state police have a policy of turning over any cash\nseizures of more than $1,000 to the federal government, which will\nsend most of that back to them.  \n\n   And when state and local police team up on a drug case, local\npolice take all the proceeds and spend half to buy law enforcement\nequipment that they then give to the State Patrol.  \n\n   -- Ohio laws are among the most restrictive in the nation.  \n\n   A felony charge generally must be filed before property can be\nforfeited in state court. And if no charges are filed and there is\nno convincing evidence of a crime, property must be returned to the\nowner.  \n\n   That's not an obstacle for police.  \n\n   Cincinnati police specialist Dave Kelly said his department\nroutinely asks a federal agency to take the property when the\nprosecutor declines to file a forfeiture proceeding.  \n\n   ``That's how we do it in Cincinnati,'' Kelly said.  \n\n   Several defense attorneys and others say, however, that Ohio\nstatutes are difficult to understand.  \n\n   ``They are very poorly written statutes, and they are confusing\nto most attorneys,'' said James Schaefer, the assistant prosecuting\nattorney who has handled forfeiture cases in Cincinnati and\nHamilton County.  \n","Headline":"\nAS STATE LAWS DIFFER, POLICE FIND VARIOUS WAYS TO SIDESTEP THEM \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Laws differ from state to state, but police\nstill sidestep them.  \n","\n   For example, little or no drug money appears to get into\neducational funds even though that's where at least eight state\nconstitutions require forfeited money and property to go.  \n","\n   Police in North Carolina get around their constitution by simply\nhanding their seizures to federal agencies, which then return up to\n80 percent to the police.  \n","\n   As a result, law enforcement there has reaped more than $14\nmillion in the last three years.
