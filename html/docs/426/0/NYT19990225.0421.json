Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Feb. 26:\n\n   When it comes to passion, few groups can compete with the animal\nlobby. Members of the New York City Council still shudder at the\nmemory of the travails they went through over the rights of\ncarriage horses.

The initiative will be popular with bicyclists,\nparents of small children and joggers who have been harassed by\nover-friendly (or under-friendly) dogs, and a relief to park\npreservationists who say the damage caused by unrestrained pets is\ntheir worst maintenance problem.\n\n   This outrages some dog owners, who say that human beings cause\nfar more damage in the parks, and that their pets are being\ndeprived of their natural right to run free.\n\n   Doggie rights are also an issue in the Giuliani administration's\nattempt to streamline the process for destroying vicious dogs. The\nmayor has proposed a bill that would put the burden of proof on a\ndog's owner to show there were extenuating circumstances when a pet\ntakes a chunk out of another city resident.\n\n   Right now, even if a veterinarian finds the dog is dangerous, it\ncan be put down only if the city can demonstrate that the attack\nwas unprovoked. As a result, animals linger on the canine\nequivalent of death row for months, taking space needed for other\nanimals.\n\n   Both these initiatives seem reasonable. Pets are important, but\npeople must come first. Dogs that bite have no place in a crowded\ncity. Neither do dogs that are so large or hyperactive that they\ncannot adjust to life on a leash. Owners have an obligation to keep\ntheir dogs licensed and under control. If they fail to follow those\nrules, they have no right to complain if they are ticketed. If a\ndog attacks someone while roaming on its own, the owner will have\nonly himself to blame if the animal is put away.\n\n   These rules exist to protect other animals as well as people.\nSmaller dogs are the most frequent targets of unleashed dogs in the\nparks, and hundreds of homeless dogs that have not bitten anyone\nhave to be killed every week because there is no room in the\nshelters. Given scarce resources, we would keep as much space as\npossible for the animals without a prior record.\n\n   We also recommend that the mayor get behind a bill proposed by\nCouncilwoman Kathryn Freed that would raise license fees for\nunspayed dogs and encourage the establishment of low-cost spaying\nand neutering clinics. Ms. Freed contends that the vast majority of\ndog bites are the work of unneutered males, and her measure could\nreduce unwanted strays in the city, as well as the number of dogs\nwith an urge for nipping.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: BRINGING THE DOGS TO HEEL  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Feb. 26:\n","\n   When it comes to passion, few groups can compete with the animal\nlobby.
