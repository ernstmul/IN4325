LOFTUS   \n Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   I'm reading in front of the fire, and our 12-year-old German\nshepherd is on the rug by my feet, sleeping lightly, chest moving\nup and down. It is as familiar to me as my own breathing, this\ncompanionship of dog and book.\n\n   Most of our pets are senior citizens, nearing the final years of\ntheir brief spans of life. I joke with friends that we're going to\nhave a mass die-off soon, but my fear is that we really will and\nthat my family's fragile, pet-loving hearts won't be able to take\nit.\n\n   Bud, our cockatiel, is 14, adopted during my junior year of\ncollege when my dormitory director moved in with her boyfriend and\nhis cat. He never learned to talk, but he can wolf whistle like a\npro and does some opera singing when I coax him.\n\n   The sisters, Mercury and Saturn, are 13, the ``kittens'' of a\ntortoise-shell stray Jim found behind a Dumpster on midnight patrol\nin Ybor City. Equinox, a stellar feline, was our beloved first cat\nas a couple, but she died young after tangling with a water\nmoccasin, so we were happy to have her progeny. Mercury and Saturn\nhave remained inseparable, grooming and sleeping curled into each\nother.\n\n   Callie, a calico adopted in Gainesville when I was a grad\nstudent at the University of Florida, was a mismatch from the\nstart. I chose her because she looked like Equinox but was unaware\nthat she was, at best, operating on very low brainpower. A\nbeautiful cat even at 11, she has never caught on to washing\nherself, and she drools when you pet her (not conducive to becoming\na lap cat.)\n\n   But she's hung around through two moves now, despite Saturn and\nMercury's utter and enduring disdain for her. So, due to my\nphilosophy that once you choose a pet, it is yours forever more, we\nfeed her and brush her and give her a warm place to sleep.\n\n   Star, our shepherd, is the protective old girl of the house, and\nstill has a bark that can knock the socks off a UPS deliveryman.\nShe's the granddaughter of a Tampa K-9 who rode in police\nhelicopters to crime scenes. Intelligent and serene, she has been\nmadly in love with my husband since the day he chose her from the\nlitter because she fell asleep on his foot.\n\n   When she was an outdoor dog, she would walk around the house\nuntil she found a window she could see Jim through and then gaze at\nhim for hours as he worked or ate or watched TV. Star, like John\nUpdike's dog made famous in his free verse, ``knows no nonhuman\nword for love.''\n\n   We also have two 3-year-old dogs, taken on during the insanity\nof my last maternity leave with the misguided postpartum notion\nthat I could take care of a newborn and two puppies at the same\ntime. A German shepherd and a black lab mix, they accompany me on\nmy nightly walks but live outdoors. They worship Star as the Wise\nOne who Lives in the House with the Humans.\n\n   Saturn sleeps with our son Adam on cold nights. Our daughter\nSarah whispers her secrets to Star every morning. Our house has\nnever been broken into. Bud wolf-whistles at me even on bad hair\ndays.\n\n   I hope our pets know, in their animal way, of the comfort\nthey've given. I say that my children have learned to be more\ngentle and giving because we have pets. But the truth is, we all\nhave.\n\n   (The Lakeland (Fla.)
