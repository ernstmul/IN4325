That's dogs\ntraveling inside cars as opposed to dogs hit by cars.\n\n   The TV newsmagazines, always seeking a fresh angle, have been\ncalling, spokeswomen from both organizations report, but vets at\nboth places had to wrack their brains to come up with just one or\ntwo examples from the last decade. This from doctors who deal with\nthousands of pet injuries each year.\n\n   Lt. Paul Maloney, spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police,\nsays that in his 29 years on the force, he has never had an\nincident in which he had to find medical attention for a dog\ninjured inside a car during an accident. A quick survey of his\ncolleagues available in the office confirmed his thoughts.\n\n   There have been a few cases in which healthy pets have been\nbrought back to the station when an owner was injured. But there is\nno protocol for dealing with injured pets, and there just doesn't\nseem to be a great need for one, he says.\n\n   That's all pretty surprising.
