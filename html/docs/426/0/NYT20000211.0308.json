Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ For dog lovers in New York City, it is tough to top\nthe hospitality of Prospect Park in Brooklyn.\n\n   There are wide-open meadows, liberal rules for letting dogs run\nfree and special doggie water fountains installed at ground level.\nIt has a large, well-organized group of dog owners _ they call\nthemselves FIDO _ who hold seminars on first aid for dogs and\nmonthly ``Coffee Bark'' socials, and even offer conflict resolution\nfor dogs and owners who just cannot get along. At Christmas, there\nis something called dog caroling.\n\n   But alas, all this dog love has a downside.\n\n   Prospect Park has quietly become a popular dumping ground for\ndogs. Scores of desperate dog owners are slinking into the park _\noften picking spots popular with dog walkers _ waiting until the\ncoast is clear, then tying up their pets and walking off. Only the\ncareless ones forget to take the tags.\n\n   Mary McInerney, the president of FIDO, an acronym for Fellowship\nfor the Interests of Dogs and their Owners, found a young,\nemaciated Rottweiler tied to a tree in July, a crumpled note tucked\nin the dog's collar. ``Please take care of my best friend Rocky,''\nthe note read. ``He was a present to me for my 16th birthday, and I\ncan't afford to keep him.''\n\n   Tupper W. Thomas, the administrator of Prospect Park and the\npresident of the Prospect Park Alliance, rescued a worm-ridden,\nepileptic beagle tied to a fence post a few years ago. The owner\nhad left the tag, so Thomas called him. ``I don't want my dog,'' he\ntold her, without a note of chagrin. ``That's why he was there.''\n\n   Vivienne A. Shaffer, director of Lefferts Homestead, a museum in\nthe park, came across a shivering shepherd mix abandoned in the\npouring rain one morning. ``My first response,'' she said, ``was\nthat I can't get emotional over every one of these dogs.''\n\n   Records from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation show\nthat park rangers alone picked up 30 abandoned dogs in Prospect\nPark last year, more than they handled in all the other parks in\nBrooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx combined. In all\nof Queens, half as many were picked up.\n\n   McInerney, however, said the total number of dogs abandoned in\nProspect Park is actually far higher. Rangers are usually called in\nas a last resort, she said, and many dogs are adopted on the spot\nby those who find them. Based on e-mails and other reports she\ngathers from the 500 people on FIDO's mailing list, she estimated\nthat at least 100 dogs a year are abandoned in the park.\n\n   ``There are so many dogs that get dumped _ just get dumped! _ in\nthe park,'' McInerney said. ``This happens all the time.''\n\n   Park officials and dog owners believe there is a simple logic\nbehind the trend, a logic that springs from the dog-friendly\nreputation of Prospect Park and neighboring Park Slope, where some\ncafe owners do not blink an eye when a dog settles in under a\ntable.\n\n   ``They go right there because they know that in that community\nthey love their dogs,'' said Jude Lassow-Sunden, director of\nMuffin's Pet Connection, a Brooklyn organization that assists in\npet adoptions. ``The word gets out _ go to the park, go to the\npark. And the people who pick up the dogs, they're all loaded and\nthey have big hearts.''\n\n   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, himself a dog owner, agreed.\n``It's like the old custom of leaving babies in front of hospitals\nor orphanages in hopes that the nuns will take care of them,'' he\nsaid, calling the practice ``a weird aspect of metropolitan life.\n\n   ``We don't approve of it,'' he added, ``but we understand it.''\n\n   The abandoned dogs fall into three categories, old and sick,\nyoung and scared, and pit bulls. The odd pure-breed shows up, as do\npuppies like Cherub, a floppy-eared mutt rescued two years ago by\nAudrey Kindred and her partner, Annie Lanzillotto. ``People are so\ngood to dogs in this neighborhood,'' Kindred said. ``I almost hate\nto say this because you don't want to encourage it, but it's\nprobably the best place a person could leave their dog.''\n\n   On a warm weekend morning, it is not unusual to find hundreds of\ndogs romping free in the park as their owners mingle, chat, flirt,\nread or romp themselves. Couples have met and married because their\ndogs touched noses. Lonely hearts have been known to get dogs just\nto join the scene.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   At the center of this community is FIDO, a group formed 18\nmonths ago to keep the peace between dog owners and everyone else\nwho uses the park. This has meant making accommodations with bird\nlovers, buying extra garbage cans for the park and gently reminding\ndog owners of the rules for when and where dogs must be on a leash\nduring the day. The group, which has a Web site,\nwww.offleash.com/fido.html, has recently formed a rescue committee\nthat is drafting a pamphlet on dealing with abandoned dogs.

McInerney spent weeks nursing Rocky back to health and\nfinding him a home. Thomas took the epileptic beagle home, named\nhim Jammin' _ ``My daughter was very into reggae at the time,'' she\nexplained _ and soon enough fell in love. ``He's the sweetest\ndog,'' she said.\n\n   Shaffer was not quite sure what to do with that dripping wet\nshepherd. He looked so mean and ugly, she said, and when she\nbrought him home, her husband's response was, ``Have you lost your\nmind?'' At first they called him Sid, as in Sid Vicious, but her\nson christened him Wolfie, and they have come to appreciate\nWolfie's charms, although the dog seems to carry some emotional\nbaggage.\n\n   ``He doesn't like going to the park at all,'' she said.\n\n   But many dogs are not as lucky. Some end up at the city's Center\nfor Animal Care and Control, which euthanized almost 40,000 of the\n61,000 dogs, cats and other animals brought to its shelters across\nthe city last year.
