Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to online privacy, it seems that the\nClinton administration has not been practicing what it preaches.\n\n   Only a handful of the administration's sites on the World Wide\nWeb post the kinds of privacy guidelines that the Federal Trade\nCommission recently criticized businesses for failing to post, and\nnone of the administration's sites offer the special protections\nfor children that the government recommends for commercial sites.\n\n   Even the White House Web site does not meet the standards\nrecommended by the FTC and endorsed by the administration.\n\n   For example, the White House site collects e-mail addresses _\nand in some cases, home addresses _ through links that allow\nvisitors to send electronic messages to President and Mrs. Clinton\nand Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Gore. Yet, it does not provide\nany notice about how that information will be used by the White\nHouse. Nor does the site ask visitors to its special children's\npages to consult their parents before divulging personal\ninformation, as the administration has recommended.\n\n   In June, the FTC released a survey of commercial Web sites along\nwith a report that was highly critical of industries that gather\ninformation online and, without notifying the visitors to their\nsites, use or sell the data for marketing purposes. The report's\nfindings, particularly with respect to children, prompted the FTC\nto recommend that Congress pass a law requiring that online\nbusinesses and Web site operators obtain parental permission before\ngathering e-mail addresses or other information from children under\nthe age of 13.\n\n   Unlike operators of commercial sites, federal agencies do not\ncollect or sell personal data for marketing purposes. The issue,\ncritics say, is more one of leading by example.\n\n   ``It's really a matter of practicing what they preach,'' said\nDavid Banisar, senior policy analyst and staff counsel at the\nElectronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research\ngroup in Washington. ``They have been pushing notice and consent,\nand they can't even do it themselves. They really have a dismal\nrecord on this.''\n\n   Banisar also pointed out that while the White House might not be\nusing the information for marketing purposes, the data could be\ntransferred to the Democratic National Committee or used for other\npolitical ends.\n\n   The administration has endorsed child-protection legislation\nthat was introduced in response to the FTC report. It has also\nendorsed new self-regulation guidelines and enforcement procedures\nrecently proposed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of\nbusinesses and associations that seeks to foster privacy\nprotections. Those guidelines call for all Internet businesses to\nclearly post policies concerning the use and collection of personal\ninformation, and they require Web site operators to obtain parental\napproval before gathering data from children.\n\n   Yet, despite the administration's support for these measures,\nthe White House Web site collects information from children without\nparental notification. Within a special children's section on the\nsite, a White House tour led by cartoon caricatures of the ``First\nPets,'' Buddy the dog and Socks the cat, ends with an invitation to\nsend e-mail to President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice\nPresident Al Gore.\n\n   The electronic form asks for the sender's name, age, e-mail\naddress, grade at school, the school's name and, from those\nvisitors who want a response, a home postal address. The site does\nnot advise children to ask their parents before divulging that\ninformation.\n\n   Likewise, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has an area\nfor children, like that of the White House site, that offers the\nopportunity to send an e-mail message, yet does not display a\nprivacy policy or request that children seek parental permission\nbefore giving out e-mail addresses.\n\n   The White House Web site provides links to 70 Web sites of\nfederal agencies, Cabinet departments and White House offices and\ncommissions. Of those 70 sites, only 12 had posted privacy policies\nas of Friday afternoon. That amounts to 17 percent of the sites\nsurveyed, only slightly better than the 14 percent of commercial\nsites that, according to the FTC's report, had clearly posted\nprivacy policies earlier this year.\n\n   The White House, the vice president's office and Mrs. Clinton's\npress office did not respond directly to questions about the Web\nsites' lack of a posted privacy policy. But administration\nofficials stressed that in May, Clinton ordered the Office of\nManagement and Budget to conduct an agency-by-agency review to\nensure that new technologies were not violating the Privacy Act or\notherwise eroding privacy protections.\n\n   A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget said the\nagency was drafting guidelines for federal Web sites.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
