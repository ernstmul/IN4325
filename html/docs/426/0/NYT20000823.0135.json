KAHN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ Whales splash off White Crest Beach on a\npostcard-perfect Cape Cod morning. Wellfleet Police Chief Richard\nRosenthal, parked atop the dunes in his cruiser, squints through\nthe windshield. A discussion about serial killers and book\npublishers _ Rosenthal, the author of four books, is a credible\nauthority on both professions _ is briefly put on hold.\n\n   ``The fact that we're sitting here, in my town, watching whales\nbreaching, is pretty neat,'' says Rosenthal slowly.\n\n   Not what a New York cop would expect to see in the East River?\n\n   ``No,'' says Rosenthal with a gruff laugh. ``Maybe bodies\nfloating, though.''\n\n   No stretch there. Rosenthal, 54, has seen just about everything,\nincluding floaters, during his 32 years in law enforcement. Ten\nyears ago, after serving as an undercover cop, robbery detective,\nfirearms expert, homicide investigator, and a NYPD chopper pilot,\nhe moved to this quiet Outer Cape community (pop. 3,000) to run a\npolice department cut more in the mold of ``Mayberry RFD'' than\n``NYPD Blue.'' Hell's Kitchen this is not. In Wellfleet, organized\ncrime is two teenagers conspiring to shoplift a six-pack of Coca\nCola.\n\n   There's a curious thing about the town's men in blue, though,\nand one befitting its reputation as a seasonal arts colony. Besides\nRosenthal, two former officers are also professional writers. Alec\nWilkinson, a longtime summer resident and New Yorker staffer, wrote\nthe first of his five books, ``Midnights: A Year With the Wellfleet\nPolice,'' after working as a cop here in the early 1980s. His book\nwas reissued this spring.\n\n   Lucas Miller, who also summered here for many years prior to\ndonning the Wellfleet badge and uniform, now writes a monthly\ncolumn for Slate from his current vantage point as an NYPD\ndetective and former narcotics officer. Miller recently fielded\nseveral book-contract offers as well, which for the moment he says\nare on hold.\n\n   And then there's Rosenthal, who just published ``Rookie Cop:\nDeep Undercover in the Jewish Defense League'' (Leapfrog Press).\nWith a novel (``The Murder of Old Comrades'') and two nonfiction\nbooks (``Sky Cops'' and ``K-9 Cops'') already to his credit,\nRosenthal has taken writing well beyond the hobby stage and made it\na serious second career.\n\n   ``I don't have writer's block. I don't even know what that is,''\nsays Rosenthal, who has also written two unpublished novels and\nplans a future nonfiction book about Hadden Clark, a convicted\nserial killer whose grim dominion included the Outer Cape.\n\n   If that doesn't sound like the resume of a typical small-town\nNew England police chief, neither does Rosenthal. In fact, he\nspeaks both German and Russian with passable fluency and sprinkles\nconversations with terms like ``conundrum'' and ``sobriquet.''\n\n   ``Rookie Cop'' revisits Rosenthal's first year on the force,\nwhen he was plucked fresh from the Police Academy and assigned to\ninfiltrate the JDL, led by Rabbi Meir Kahane (``Every Jew a\ntwenty-two.''). At the time Rosenthal joined the NYPD's Bureau of\nSpecial Services, in 1969, Kahane and his followers were suspected\nof at least one fatal bombing in Manhattan. New to police work,\nRosenthal, a Brooklyn native, was cast as the spy who came in from\nleft field.\n\n   At least some JDL members immediately fingered him as a likely\ninformant, not the taxi driver he claimed to be. Despite this,\nRosenthal was put in charge of the group's weapons arsenal. Much of\nhis book reads like outtakes from ``The Gang That Couldn't Shoot\nStraight,'' with JDL members retreating to a makeshift terrorist\n``camp'' in upstate New York, trying to manufacture explosives that\nwould actually work. Soviet officials were their principal targets,\nbut African-American groups, the PLO, and even the Ku Klux Klan\ndrew their attention too. Kahane comes across as a forceful if\nflawed leader, while Rosenthal walks a fine line between helping\nthe group and thwarting its efforts.\n\n   ``They were a fairly dysfunctional group,'' Rosenthal avers.\n``They take a guy like me, a nonreligious, secular Jew who doesn't\ndress or act like them _ that should have been a flag that\nsomething was wrong.'' Yet they were so in need of a weapons\nexpert, according to Rosenthal, that JDL members overlooked obvious\nclues, including the fact that Rosenthal was married to a\nGerman-born, non-Jewish woman.\n\n   Disorganized, maybe. Even delusional on occasion. But dangerous\nnonetheless, Rosenthal contends.\n\n   ``They only killed one person, to the best of my knowledge,'' he\nsays. ``But they blew up a lot of places. It was only a matter of\ntime before they killed somebody else. And as the organization\nevolved, they became very paranoid.''\n\n   Kahane and others were arrested on weapons and bomb-making\ncharges in May 1971, ending Rosenthal's undercover role. More than\n100 firearms were recovered by state and federal agents. Rosenthal\nsubsequently testified against JDL members during a trial that\nslapped Kahane with a five-year jail sentence. Kahane later\nemigrated to Israel; he was assassinated in New York City in 1990.\nRosenthal wound up socializing with a group of fellow cops who had\ninfiltrated groups such as the Black Panthers, Students for a\nDemocratic Society, the Communist Party, and others deemed security\nthreats in the '60s and '70s.\n\n   Not that it is much of an issue in Wellfleet, but Rosenthal\ndefends domestic surveillance of so-called radical groups as a\nnecessary evil in a free society _ more so in the wake of incidents\nsuch as the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet even in a community like\nWellfleet, he says, there are built-in tensions about what\ntownspeople do and do not expect from law enforcement.\n\n   ``They want us to protect them and their property, but they\ndon't want us to interfere,'' he says. ``They want us to make sure\ninappropriate people are controlled, but they don't want us to\nbother people walking down the street. It's a matter of finding the\nright balance, and that's difficult to find.''\n\n   The difficulty was underscored earlier this year by two\nincidents of alleged racial profiling on the Outer Cape, one\ninvolving Rosenthal and a fellow Wellfleet officer. In each case, a\ngun was drawn on an unarmed black man _ one a Cape Cod Times\nreporter, the other a Senegalese college student.\n\n   Rosenthal won't discuss the Wellfleet incident in detail except\nto say his department's actions got a ``bad rap.'' His 13-member\nforce, he says, has two black officers. He does admit to suffering\nfrom professional culture shock, though, in moving to a place like\nWellfleet.\n\n   ``It took me a while to become comfortable with the dynamics,''\nhe says, shifting his bulky frame in the cruiser's front seat. ``I\ncame from a big city, where officers are basically anonymous.\nYou're a technocrat there. You enforce the law or not. In little\ntowns there's an intertwining of citizens and authorities. If you\nantagonize the citizens, it has a negative effect on your budget.\nThat's the reality.''\n\n   Every summer, when Wellfleet's population swells to around\n20,000, the police department hires eight or nine part-time\nofficers. Even with the seasonal influx, however, violent crime is\npractically nonexistent out here. Rosenthal says Wellfleet police\nhave logged no murders and one armed robbery during his tenure.\n\n   Miller, one of the town's other writers in blue, was a full-time\nofficer in 1990 when Rosenthal took over the department.\n\n   ``The other cops had no idea what to make of Rich,'' Miller\nrecalls. ``It's traditional for regular cops to look down on\nadministrators. Yet here was a guy with 100 times the experience\nthey had, and they couldn't get him worked up about anything. He'd\ncome in and listen to their grievances and basically say, `Suck it\nup, guys.' ''\n\n   Says Rosenthal: ``In a small town you can get away with almost\nanything so long as you're not perceived as a liar. If people think\nyou lie, you're dead in the water and might as well move on.''\n\n   Rosenthal wrote his first novel after meeting author J. C.\nPollack through a mutual friend. Pollack, the author of ``Mission:\nMIA'' and other thrillers, encouraged Rosenthal to try writing\nfiction. Rosenthal's previous writing had been limited to technical\narticles on police work. The result of meeting Pollack was ``Old\nComrades,'' a Cold War novel set in Manhattan that draws on\nRosenthal's background as a Russian language specialist in the US\nAir Force. After reading a draft of the novel, Pollack steered\nRosenthal toward Simon & Schuster and helped him find an agent.\n\n   Published in 1992, ``Old Comrades'' earned Rosenthal a $10,000\nadvance and sold a respectable 20,000 copies. But a second novel\nnever did get published _ even Rosenthal calls it ``terrible'' _\nand he turned to nonfiction. It took him nine months apiece to\nwrite his next two books, Rosenthal says, each based on one of his\npassions: flying helicopters and raising dogs. He and his wife,\nFrauke, a Wellfleet firefighter, also enjoy taking motorcycle trips\ntogether. They have no children.\n\n   ``Only after my first book did it dawn on me how hard it is,\nthat this is more of a business than an art form,'' Rosenthal says.\n``I'm very methodical now. I don't write on spec. I do a proposal.\nIf it gets bought I write the book.\n\n   ``Writing and selling fiction is much more difficult than\nnonfiction,'' he continues. ``Nonfiction, and I may regret these\nwords, is simple. It's a matter of finding an interesting subject,\nresearching it, and putting it in words other people want to\nread.''\n\n   After ``K-9 Cops,'' Rosenthal switched publishers, moving from\nPocket Books to Leapfrog Press, a small Wellfleet-based enterprise.\nMid-list authors like him get lost at big houses, he explains. ``If\nyou get no publicity, no one knows you exist _ no matter how good\nthe book is,'' Rosenthal says.\n\n   Hadden Clark, a serial killer with a history of mental illness\nand a penchant for cross-dressing, could be Rosenthal's most\ncommercial subject yet. Rosenthal guesses that Clark, convicted in\nMaryland in 1993 on a single murder count, may have killed as many\nas 20 people dating back to the early '80s. Clark also pleaded\nguilty to a second murder and has admitted to a dozen more,\nalthough investigators have had trouble confirming his confessions.\nOn three visits to the Outer Cape, Clark, a former Provincetown\ncook, has led a team of law enforcement personnel _ including\nRosenthal _ on fruitless searches for the remains of additional\nvictims.\n\n   That only lends more spice to the tale, insists the chief, who\nhas also been shadowed by Wilkinson _ Wellfleet really is a small\ntown _ for an upcoming New Yorker piece on the Clark case.\n\n   Clark is unique, Rosenthal says, ``only in the length of time he\ngot away with his crimes. And anyway, everything is a mystery until\nit's solved.''\n\n   Ironically, Rosenthal says he steers away from books and films\nlike ``The Silence of the Lambs.''\n\n   ``Being a homicide detective really had an impact on my\npersonality,'' he says. ``It hardens you. It is not a healthy\nthing. It desensitizes you, yet stories about serial killers and\nhomicidal maniacs do fascinate people. I recognize that.''\n","Headline":"\n888-603-1036.)  \n WRITING A BLUE STREAK \n","Text":["\n   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ Whales splash off White Crest Beach on a\npostcard-perfect Cape Cod morning.
