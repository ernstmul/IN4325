And the tool that cut out\nenough hassles for James to pursue the hobby is his home computer.\n\n   James said the computer does two things that make genealogy\nsimpler, more fun and more efficient: It organizes records, and it\nlinks hobbyists through the Internet for the exchange of ideas and\ninformation.\n\n   But unfortunately, the Internet is not the genealogy panacea\nthat some people believe. Genealogy experts like James and Carole\nMedlar, genealogy librarian for the Dayton and Montgomery County\nPublic Library, say nothing can substitute yet for the hours people\nspending looking through paper records for data about their\nancestors.\n\n   ``There are people who come in thinking they can find their\nentire family tree on the Internet, but that's not usually true,''\nMedlar said. ``That doesn't happen unless you stumble across\nsomeone online who has gone to all the trouble before you.''\n\n   Gathering information\n\n   If you're interested in tracing your roots, a good place to\nstart is with your family members, according to James and Medlar.\nAnd a key bit of information you need to have is where people\nlived.\n\n   James, for example, said his father left him a family tree with\nnames and dates relating to his ancestry. ``When I was starting out\nI brought it to a woman who had been doing research, and she said\nthe things my father left me were exciting, but they weren't all\nthat useful,'' he said.\n\n   James was a civilian employee in the flight dynamics laboratory\nbefore he retired, and he worked with computers 15 or 20 years\nbefore retiring. He now writes a monthly column on computer\nresearch for the newsletter of the local chapter of the Ohio\nGenealogical Society.\n\n   To get authoritative information on who was related to whom, a\nresearcher has to get to local records in the places their\nancestors were born, exchanged property, died and so on. In the\nUnited States, most of the important records are kept at the county\nlevel.\n\n   A birth certificate on file in a county office with the names of\nthe parents and the child is an example of the kind of primary\nsource material that is tapped to produce a well-documented family\ntree. Also important are marriage and death certificates, church\nrecords, deeds and wills and old federal Census records.\n\n   Medlar said only a fraction of that kind of information is\naccessible directly through the Internet, but the Internet\ncomputers at the public library are still a great resource for\ngenealogical research.\n\n   ``Researching genealogy has grown to be one of the top three\nhobbies in the United States and the Internet does offer marvelous\nsupport for it,'' she said.\n\n   Medlar said library patrons can log on to one of the library's\nInternet computers to access databases with research information.\n\n   One such database is the Social Security death benefit index,\nshe said. The online resource allows researchers to find the names\nand dates people died and the names of people who received death\nbenefits after the deaths.\n\n   Medlar said the library provides free access to some premium\nreference databases. These are reference tools that normally carry\na subscription or per-use price, but the library pays the fees for\nits patrons.\n\n   If you're doing research on the Internet from home, the place\nmost people start is at cyndislist.com. Cyndi's List is a free site\nmanaged by genealogist Cyndi Howell, and it contains links to\n41,700 sites and archives.\n\n   The sites include thousands of links to hobbyists who have\nresearched their family trees, and there's a chance you'll find\nsomeone with common ancestors.\n\n   The Internet resources, though, generally only provide clues\nthat point researchers to more traditional research avenues such as\ncounty records.\n\n   ``The Internet is all secondary data,'' James said. ``You can't\ntrust any of it as absolute.''\n\n   The public library is a great source for noncomputer records.\nFor example, the Dayton library has microfilm Census records for\nall Ohio counties through 1860 and for Montgomery County through\n1920.\n\n   The main branch of the Dayton library downtown has a genealogy\nresearch section, and Medlar is on duty in the area from 2 to 6\np.m. Wednesdays. She's available at the reference desk on other\ndays.\n\n   Medlar said even if researchers can pinpoint where to look for\nold records, they usually have to review such records themselves to\nget information. ``Usually county workers are busy doing county\nwork,'' she said. ``Going through old county records is not what\nthey're paid for.''\n\n   James said he and his wife gather much of their information\nwhile traveling.\n\n   ``We don't build our vacations around places we want to go to do\nresearch,'' James said. ``But it's not unusual for us to stop for a\nday on the way to going somewhere or on the way back.''\n\n   Organizing information\n\n   James said that where computers really shine is in compiling\ndata in a convenient form.\n\n   ``I've been working with the same piece of genealogy software\nfor the last nine years, and I still don't know all the things it\ncan do yet,'' he said.\n\n   James said he keeps his genealogy records using a software\nprogram called Brothers Keeper, but he said most of the programs on\nthe market cost about $15 to $45 and do basically the same thing.\n\n   He said some popular programs include Family Tree Maker,\nUltimate Family Tree and Personal Ancestral File.

It lists a\nhusband, wife and their offspring along with some details about the\nfamily's personal history.\n\n   James said genealogy software allows the researcher to enter\ndata in a simple format. The software maintains the links between\npeople that have been entered into the system, and it helps the\nresearcher manipulate the data into useful forms.\n\n   Most of the software packages allow the researcher to enter\nnotes on the people whose names are listed. Some also store photos\nconnected with records.\n\n   ``A lot of people go back a few generations and they stop trying\nto go further and further back,'' James said. ``Instead they get\ninto researching details about their ancestors' lives. They're more\ninterested in what their ancestors did day to day than in anything\nelse.''\n\n   James said he's primarily been interested in tracing his direct\nancestors back as far as possible. So far he's traced his line back\neight generations to a man named David James who was born in 1660,\nprobably in Cardiff, Wales.\n\n   Just including direct ancestors only going back eight\ngenerations involves recording information on 256 people. And\nJames, who is still filling gaps in his direct lineage, also has\nrecords of siblings and multiple marriages that make his database\neven more complex.\n\n   ``I never would have been able to keep all this straight without\na computer,'' he said.\n\n   When James goes to a county office, cemetery or library to look\nup information about his family, he doesn't take a notepad and\npencil like old fashioned genealogists. He takes a laptop computer.\n\n   Online exchanges\n\n   In addition to record-keeping, James said computers are most\nuseful in linking researchers to other researchers via the\nInternet.\n\n   ``In the old days before the Internet your chances of finding\nsomebody else working on your family tree would be almost nil,'' he\nsaid. ``Now it happens all the time.''\n\n   James said his wife's maiden name was Allenduff and in 1800,\nthere were records for only two people with that name in the United\nStates. ``Nobody knows where they came from,'' he said. ``They\ncould have been dropped out of a spaceship.''\n\n   But even with such a small family, James has found four people\nonline researching the Allenduff ancestry.\n\n   He's found even more people researching the James lineage.\n\n   ``The further you go back, the more direct ancestors you have,''\nJames explained. ``And the more direct ancestors you know about,\nthe better the chances are that some other direct descendant is\ndoing research, too.''\n\n   Resources like Cyndi's List provide a way for people doing\nresearch on their family trees to let the world know what they're\ndoing. And it's common for researchers to cross paths.\n\n   ``The standard greeting is 'Hi, Cousin!' when you hear from a\nrelative you didn't know you had,'' James said.\n\n   He said researchers do more than chat when they meet on line;\nthey also exchange data.\n\n   In years past, James said if he found a relative working on\nJames family history he and the relative would print out their\nfamily tree records and send them in a big envelope.\n\n   Now he said it's possible to send records electronically. Most\ngenealogy software programs are able to convert information into a\nstandard format that can be shared by other software programs.\n\n   ``Just in the last week a relative sent me an e-mail that had\ndata on 200 people in an attachment,'' he said. ``Every year you do\nmore exchanges and you send more data electronically.''\n\n   Of course, James doesn't just dump information from other\nresearchers into his own database without checking out the new\ninformation first. ``It's source material just like everything\nelse. It gives you new information to look into.''\n\n   James also said exchanging information via e-mail has its\ndrawbacks.\n\n   ``You have to be careful with the information you send on living\npeople,'' he said. ``Things like mother's maiden name, for example.\nDo you realize how often mother's maiden name and information like\nthat is used as a security check? You don't want to spread\ninformation that someone could use to steal someone else's\nidentity.''\n\n   CONTACT James Cummings at 225-2395 or by e-mail at\njamescummings(at)coxohio.com\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   Gene and Janice James of Riverside, Ohio had been interested in\nthe histories of their families for years, but Gene said they never\ngot deeply into the genealogy hobby until he retired around 1988.\n","\n   ``We tried to get started once or twice, but the record-keeping\nand paper pushing was just horrendous,'' Gene James said. ``I\ndidn't have the time and patience for that.''\n","\n   Now Gene James is a dedicated hobby genealogist who has traced\nhis direct ancestry to the 17th century.
