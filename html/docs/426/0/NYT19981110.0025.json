But today's terrorists, be\nthey international cults like Aum Shinrikyo or individual nihilists\nlike the Unabomber, act on a greater variety of motives than ever\nbefore.\n\n   More ominously, terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass\ndestruction, including nuclear devices, germ dispensers, poison gas\nweapons and even computer viruses.\n\n   Also new is the world's dependence on a nearly invisible and\nfragile network for distributing energy and information. Long part\nof the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios,\ncatastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a\ncontingency that could happen next month.\n\n   Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism\nseriously, as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its\nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August, it is not yet prepared\nfor the new threat of catastrophic terrorism.\n\n   American military superiority on the conventional battlefield\npushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives. The\nUnited States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its\nattempt to target chemical weapons. Russia, storehouse of tens of\nthousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more,\nmay be descending into turmoil.\n\n   Meanwhile, the combination of new technology and lethal force\nhas made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and\nnuclear alternatives. Technology is more accessible, and society is\nmore vulnerable.\n\n   Elaborate international networks have developed among organized\ncriminals, drug traffickers, arms dealers and money launderers,\ncreating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the\nworld.\n\n   The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack\nwith weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or\ntens of thousands, of lives.\n\n   If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center\nhad been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen,\nthe resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to\ndescribe it.\n\n   Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event\nin American history. It could involve loss of life and property\nunprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental\nsense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.\n\n   Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future\ninto a before and after. The United States might respond with\ndraconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider\nsurveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly\nforce.\n\n   More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or\nU.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders\nnegligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.\n\n   The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against\nAmerica and its allies is greater now than at any time since the\nCuban missile crisis of 1962. It is a national security problem\nthat deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats\nof military nuclear attack or regional aggression.\n\n   The first obstacle to imagination is resignation. The prospects\nmay seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything\nuseful.\n\n   Some are fatalistic, as if contemplating the possibility of a\nsupernova. Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the\nnuclear age, expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing\nany further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture. But as\nwith nuclear deterrence, the good news is that more can be done.\n\n   The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is\ncomplicated by ``placeless'' culprits, concealed weapons\ndevelopment and unconventional deployments, all of which are hard\nto monitor and preempt. In cyberattacks, for example, the\ndeployment of weapons can be entirely electronic.\n\n   The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to\nmonitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have\nthe motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction.\n\n   In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world, the\nUnited States should utilize remote sensing technology and\ncultivate global sources of information. Necessary measures include\nclandestine collection of open sources, such as foreign newspapers\nand the Internet, as well as a full exchange of information with\nkey allies.\n\n   Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the\nAum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on\ncivilians. Although the Japanese media had reported the news, the\nU.S. government remained in the dark.\n\n   Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement\nagencies knew, but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware\nof what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered. The\nparties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another\nattack.\n\n   To this day, U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform\ncomprehensive planning for the collection of information, where the\nyields from overhead reconnaissance, electronic surveillance,\nclandestine agents, law-enforcement databases and informants, and\nreports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for\nmaximum effect.\n\n   The intelligence job is hard but not impossible. The would-be\nterrorists have problems as well. If they are supported by a state,\ntheir organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and\nfeckless. If they are not backed by a state, the group may be\nsmall, feckless and pathological too.\n\n   These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success.\nThe national security agencies can seize the initiative.\n\n   Domestic law-enforcement officials, understandably, do not\nactively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on\ninformants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal\nactions. Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out\nand looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime.\n\n   On the other hand, domestic law enforcement has many techniques\nfor gathering data, including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury\ninvestigations. Much of what these efforts yield, however, is\nclosed off to the national security community by law or regulation\nto safeguard constitutional rights.\n\n   The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence\non catastrophic terrorism _ a National Terrorism Intelligence\nCenter _ that would collect and analyze information so it could\nwarn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time.\n\n   Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement\ndata, it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency.\nInstead, the National Center should incorporate the highly\nsuccessful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism\nCenter, which has a narrower mandate than this proposal, and be\nlocated in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n   However, the center would be run by an operating committee\nchaired by the director of central intelligence and including the\ndirector of the FBI, the deputy secretary of defense, the deputy\nattorney general, the deputy secretary of state and the deputy\nnational security adviser.\n\n   The National Foreign Intelligence Program, which already\nprovides support for the FBI's National Security Division, would\ncover the center's budget, while the National Security Council\nwould take up unresolved disputes.\n\n   The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI\nand the CIA, and all intelligence organizations would provide a\nspecified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel\nceilings.\n\n   In short, the center would combine the active intelligence\ngathering approach of the national security agencies, which are not\nlegally constrained in their foreign investigations, with the\ndomestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement\nagencies.\n\n   This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for\ncivil liberties. The center would have no powers of arrest and\nprosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the\ntraditional defense and intelligence agencies.\n\n   The center would also be subject to oversight from existing\ninstitutions, like the federal judiciary, the President's Foreign\nIntelligence Advisory Board, and the select intelligence committees\nof Congress. Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign\nintelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law\nenforcement.\n\n   Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America's\nfuture. But the United States can fight back only if it sets the\nright goals.\n\n   In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. government pondered what kind of\nforces it would need to wage a global war. The answers went so far\nbeyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in\nWashington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their\nrounds.\n\n   The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief. The notion of\nan intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from\nthe upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched\nin 1954, when the U-2 program was born. The films and cameras alone\nseemed an overwhelming hurdle.\n\n   A few years later the U-2s were flying; six years later\nsatellites were in place. Similar stories could be told about the\nremarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast\ndeployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of\narmored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992.\n\n   America can meet new challenges, but it must first imagine\nsuccess. Only then can it organize itself to attain it.\n\n     (This article is adapted from the complete report of the\nUniversities Study Group on Catastrophic Terrorism, published by\nStanford University.
