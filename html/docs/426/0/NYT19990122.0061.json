Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Starting within the next month, the cars of people\narrested on drunken driving charges in New York City will be seized\non the spot and later forfeited if the drivers are convicted,\nPolice Commissioner Howard Safir announced Thursday.\n\n   ``If you're going to drive drunk,'' Safir said, ``you're going\nto face a serious penalty.''\n\n   State law currently allows the forfeiture of vehicles owned by\nrepeat offenders, but it is rarely enforced, officials said.

Giuliani said forfeiture would be a welcome addition to\nhis administration's arsenal of weapons against dangerous driving,\nwhich has included speeding crackdowns and cameras that catch\ndrivers who run red lights.\n\n   ``This will help us build on the success we had in reducing\ntraffic fatalities,'' Giuliani said.\n\n   Seizing cars may sound tough, he said, ``but anything we can do\nto convince people not to get behind the wheel of the car after\nthey have had a drink is good.''\n\n   ``If it takes taking their car from them to convince them that\nthey should not get behind the wheel of the car after they've had a\ndrink,'' Giuliani said, ``we're probably saving them a lot of\nproblems in the future.''\n\n   Jonathan Gradess, the executive director of the New York State\nDefenders Association, said that the city and Safir were picking an\ninopportune time to try to expand the uses of forfeiture.\n\n   ``He's doing it at a moment in history when forfeiture laws,\neven those used to attach property used as the direct instrument of\na crime'' _ such as burglars' tools _ ``are under intense\nscrutiny,'' Gradess said.\n\n   He cited cases where police departments and prosecutors' offices\nwere accused of seizing cars willy-nilly to expand their fleets.\n\n   Forfeiture laws, he said, ``have been criticized by the Supreme\nCourt, by the Congress, and state legislatures are slowing down on\nthe use of forfeiture.
