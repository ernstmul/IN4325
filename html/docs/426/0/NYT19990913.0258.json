Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The renewed attention on Waco underscores what some\ncritics see as a troubling trend in U.S. law enforcement _ the\nincreased militarization of police departments.\n\n   Encouraged by Congress and recent administrations, local law\nenforcement agencies have turned to the military for equipment and\ntraining, particularly when it comes to fighting drug crimes. Over\nthe past 20 years, lawmakers and presidents have chipped away at\nthe landmark Posse Comitatus Act, a post-Civil War law that banned\nthe military from enforcing civilian laws.\n\n   Congress, in fact, is poised to pass a bill that would make it\neven easier for local police departments to call on the military\nfor help.\n\n   ``It's a growing problem,'' said Gregory Nojeim, an attorney\nwith the American Civil Liberties Union's national office in\nWashington. ``Increasing numbers of local law enforcement agencies\nare forming SWAT teams and adopting SWAT team tactics that are\nsometimes used when they're not necessary.''\n\n   Today, it is not uncommon for the Defense Department to share\nits military equipment. In 1981, Congress passed the Military\nCooperation with Law Enforcement Officials Act, which authorized\nthe military to ``assist'' civilian police in enforcing drug laws.\nPresident Bush later established six regional task forces within\nthe Department of Defense to work with police agencies to combat\ndrug activity.\n\n   Between 1995 and 1997, the Pentagon distributed to police\ndepartments approximately 1.2 million pieces of military hardware,\nincluding 73 grenade launchers and 112 armored personnel carriers,\naccording to a report released by the Cato Institute, a libertarian\nthink tank. In 1994, the departments of Justice and Defense signed\na joint agreement to develop and share technology and equipment.\n\n   Police officials say the equipment sharing and training is\njustified in light of the heavy firepower used by some modern\ncriminals. They also defend it as cost effective.\n\n   Critics, however, say the line between soldier and police\nofficer is becoming dangerously blurred. An unusual coalition of\ncivil libertarians, gun-rights advocates and even some former\npolice officers are decrying the trend.\n\n   ``I think it's been incremental, but it's actually an incredible\nfundamental change in American policing,'' said Joseph D. McNamara,\na retired New York City police officer who also served as chief in\ndepartments in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose, Calif. McNamara, now\na research fellow at the Hoover Institution in California, said the\ndevelopment of specially trained tactical units has encouraged a\n``kick butt'' attitude among some officers that runs counter to the\nnotion of settling conflicts peacefully.\n\n   ``The sharing of training and technology is producing a shared\nmind-set,'' said Diane Cecilia Weber, a graduate student in\ncriminal justice in Virginia who wrote ``Warrior Cops'' for the\nCato Institute. ``The problem is that the mind-set of the soldier\nis simply not appropriate for the civilian police officer.''\n\n   Unlike soldiers, Weber said, police officers are trained to use\ndeadly force only as a last resort, and they must always be mindful\nof the constitutional rights of all citizens. ``The police mind-set\nis one of more restraint,'' she said.\n\n   The military influence on police departments will likely be part\nof new investigations into the disastrous 1993 raid on the Branch\nDavidian compound near Waco, Texas. The military provided some\ntraining and aid for agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms.\n\n   But even as a new independent panel prepares to take a look at\nthe role of the military in the Waco raid, a defense authorization\nbill would make it easier for local enforcement agencies to turn to\nthe military for help in certain situations.\n\n   The bill, which is working its way through Congress, includes a\nlittle-noted provision that eases restrictions on police\ndepartments calling in the military. Currently, the military can\nonly be called in under emergencies involving biological or\nchemical weapons. Even in those operations, soldiers cannot be\ninvolved in any arrests.\n\n   Under the new language, which is included in the final version\nof the defense bill now headed for passage in the House and Senate,\nthe emergency designation is no longer needed. And soldiers would\nonly be barred from direct involvement in arrests.\n\n   In what would be another break with current policy, local law\nenforcement agencies would not have to reimburse the military for\naid, a change that would likely encourage more joint operations.\n\n   ``I don't think most lawmakers even know this is in the bill,''\nsaid the ACLU's Nojeim, who is trying to get the new language\nremoved.\n\n   Police officials acknowledge that they have turned to the\nmilitary for training and equipment, but they said it's an\nexaggeration to suggest that police departments have adopted a\nmilitary mind-set.\n\n   ``Is there ever a time in police operations in which military\ntype tactics can be appropriate? The answer to that is yes,'' said\nEdward Flynn, the police chief for the 360-strong force in\nArlington, Va. ``Should police departments behave like military\nunits? The answer to that is no.''\n\n   Flynn, who also serves on the board of directors for the Police\nExecutive Research Forum in Washington, said that on ``rare\noccasions'' specially trained teams can use ``sophisticated\nweapons'' to intimidate criminals and diffuse potentially violent\nsituations.\n\n   But McNamara, the retired police chief, is wary of the\nintermingling between the military and police departments because\nit can create an ``elite'' force that is distant from the\ncommunity. ``These units have taken on a life of their own,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   (Sean Loughlin is in the Washington Bureau of the New York Times\nRegional Newspapers.)\n","Headline":"\nCRITICS WARN OF BLURRED LINES BETWEEN SOLDIER AND COP \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ The renewed attention on Waco underscores what some\ncritics see as a troubling trend in U.S. law enforcement _ the\nincreased militarization of police departments.\n","\n   Encouraged by Congress and recent administrations, local law\nenforcement agencies have turned to the military for equipment and\ntraining, particularly when it comes to fighting drug crimes.
