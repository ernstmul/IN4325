Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has trained his\nquality-of-life sights on the city's dogs with a bill that would\nincrease fines for harboring dogs deemed to be dangerous, deny dogs\nany consideration for being provoked into barking or biting, and\nrequire the owners of pit bulls to obtain $100,000 in liability\ninsurance before being granted a dog license.\n\n   ``It's a serious piece of legislation for a serious problem,''\nsaid Colleen Roche, Giuliani's press secretary. ``If it can prevent\nchildren or other New Yorkers from being maimed, disfigured or\nkilled, it will serve its purpose.''\n\n   But word of the administration's proposals spread quickly among\ndog lovers, perhaps at a pitch only they could hear. On Wednesday,\nmore than two dozen advocates for dogs attended a City Council\nhearing on the bill to counter, point by point, every justification\nthat city officials provided for the drastic changes.\n\n   But the city's health commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, whose\ndepartment oversees pet regulations, testified that the current law\nhas ``failed to adequately protect the public from biting dogs.''\nHe presented statistics showing that the number of ``biting dogs''\nseized by the city rose to 892 in the 1997 fiscal year from 693 in\nthe 1996 fiscal year. He added, in a third of those incidents, the\nculpable dog was a pit bull.\n\n   Existing law provides dogs with the defenses of ``provocation''\nor ``excused behavior.'' In other words, a dog slapped in the snout\ncannot be held responsible for biting, barking or otherwise\ndefending itself.\n\n   Currently, if health inspectors determine a dog to be vicious or\ndangerous, the department usually requires the owner to take steps\nthat might include muzzling it, paying for behavioral training or\neven liability insurance. The owner can appeal that decision.\n\n   However, if the investigators conclude that the owner will not\nbe able to control the dog, the owner has to demonstrate to a\ntribunal _ sometimes called ``doggie court'' _ why the dog should\nnot be removed from the city or destroyed.\n\n   Cohen argued that the procedure in place is cumbersome and\nineffective, with the burden of proof unfairly placed on the city.\n\n   To remedy such concerns, the mayor proposed to eliminate the\n``provocation'' defense for dogs accused of being dangerous, which\nofficials said would allow the city to classify more dogs as\ndangerous. The bill also calls for eliminating an owner's automatic\nright to a hearing, although one would be scheduled on request.\n\n   In addition, it singles out pit bulls, requiring those who want\nto own them to take out $100,000 in liability insurance.
