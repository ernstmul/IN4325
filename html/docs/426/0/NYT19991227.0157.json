Over the\nfive years since Joseph Morawski began to display symptoms of\nAlzheimer's disease, she had learned to play the games that kept\nhim within the bounds of normal life: hiding his clothes until he\nbathed in the morning; coaxing him out of his daughter's leather\nskirt; emptying the stones nightly from his pockets. But her\nhusband, who grew leaner and craftier every year after his\ndiagnosis, slipped out the door that day while she was hanging\nlaundry.\n\n   Almost three months later, neither his family nor the local\npolice can bring themselves to stop looking for him, and a small\narmy of outside investigators have tried to solve the riddle of\nMorawski's mind. Three weeks ago, when all the leaves were off the\ntrees, a helicopter whipped at the air over World End Pond, where,\nbefore he disappeared, neighbors had reported seeing the\n72-year-old man standing in the swamp.\n\n   Julianna Morowski feels alone, watching night fall outside her\nwindow, but 150 miles to the south, Massachusetts state police\nhelicopters were hovering over White's Woods, looking for James\nGarris, an 80-year-old Alzheimer's patient who walked out of his\nLitchfield, Connecticut convalescent home on July 5. Disappearances\nlike these repeat themselves all over the country, as Alzheimer's\npatients slip out of safe enclosures into the dark with their own\nmysterious agenda.\n\n   Thirty-two thousand wandering Alzheimer's patients are now\nreported to police annually, estimates Robert Koester, a Virginia\nsearch and rescue researcher who has devoted much of the last\ndecade to collecting and studying their habits. There is a\nparticular urgency to his project: If an Alzheimer's patient is\nfound within 24 hours, they usually return home safe. After that,\ntheir chances of survival fall to 46 percent, and search teams\nbegin to find them tangled deep in briar patches, or drowned in a\nshallow trickle of water, or frozen at a fence line in an open\nfield.\n\n   A small network of experts on Alzheimer's wanderers _ including\nseveral in the Boston area _ are trying to decode the behavior\nbefore it overtakes society's ability to find them. Already,\nsearches for people with dementia make up 12 percent of search and\nrescue operations in the Mid-Atlantic states, according to Koester.\nAnd as average lifespans increase and the baby boomers move toward\nold age, the Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of\npeople with the degenerative brain disease will increase from 4\nmillion today to 14 million in the year 2040. That burden will fall\nsquarely on the shoulders of local police and fire departments.\n\n   ``Really, it's a time bomb,'' said Nina Silverstein, who has\nresearched wanderers at UMass-Boston's Gerontology Institute. ``On\nthe level of society, I really do beleive there's been denial.''\n\n   Although wandering behavior is as old as dementia itself, the\ndisappearances have rarely been addressed as a national phenomenon,\nand even advocacy groups are unable to supply mortality statistics.\nSilverstein, who is collaborating with Flaherty on an upcoming book\ncalled ``Deadly Mix: Dementia, Wandering, and the Lost Elder,'' has\nattempted to compile statistics through searches in local press,\nand concluded that ``any number you get will be an underestimate.''\n\n   What search and rescue experts have begun to realize over the\nlast decade, as local agencies begin to compare notes on wandering\nAlzheimer's patients, is that they behave very like each other, and\nunlike any group of people that searchers know well. They don't\ncall out for help or respond to shouts; 67 percent of lost\nAlzheimer's patients cross right over roads or paths and continue\nin a straight line until they can't go any farther, shows Koester's\nresearch, which is based on 100 disappearances so serious that the\nAppalachian Search and Rescue Conference was called in.\n\n   When they die _ as 22 of Koester's hundred cases did _ it's\nusually at the point where they could not go farther. Eighteen\npercent of his subjects were found in creek or drainage areas, and\nanother 29 percent were deeply entangled in briars or bushes.\nSearchers sometimes find bodies in spots so dense that bloodhounds\ncan pass within feet of them without getting a scent, said Gerald\nFlaherty, director of the Safe Return program for the Alzheimer's\nAssociation's Massachusetts chapter, who has participated in almost\n700 searches over the last eight years. Of those, about 24 were\nfound dead.\n\n   ``They're very, very frightened, and they're trying to find a\nplace to hide, and they go into places that are terribly\ndangerous,'' said Flaherty.\n\n   The gradually gathering statistics portray a journey whose main\ngoals are primal. Koester's strangest finding was that 15 out of 19\nof his subjects moved to the south. He doesn't know why this would\nbe, but suggests two ``working hypotheses'': it could be because\nthe wanderers were moving toward the light in the sky; or _ the\n``less glamorous'' explanation _ it could be because in the rural\nareas where Koester does his work, most of the doors face south,\nand wanderers tend to move steadily in one direction.\n\n   This kind of information hasn't always penetrated the local\nagencies who do most of the searching. Curt Rudge, chief park\nranger with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental\nManagement, has a particular sense of urgency about training\nsearchers: He recalls joining a search for a missing Alzheimer's\npatient that had dragged on for five days. Using Koester's\nresearch, he directed his energies toward a thick tangle of brush.\nHe found the body in five hours.\n\n   Handled chiefly on a local level, procedures for locating\nwandering elderly people with dementia are ``a chink in the armor\nof the system,'' he said. ``We don't do this well.''\n\n   Silverstein also urged a national emphasis on preventive\nstrategies like Safe Return, which supplies identification for\nelderly wanderers and enters elderly people in a national database,\nshe said. She also recommended that dementia sufferers be assigned\n``walking buddies,'' so they can relieve their restlessness safely.\n\n   In a 1996 paper entitled ``He Comes Back Eventually...'',\nSilverstein documented the measures that elderly caregivers were\nusing to prevent their loved ones from escaping from their homes _\nposting stop signs on doors, writing notes reminding them not to\nleave, removing batteries from cars or disguising doors with\ncurtains. One man slept at the threshhold of the door, so he could\nfeel his wife stepping over him when she tried to leave. Others\nsent dogs out with their relatives with the mistaken confidence\nthat ``the dog knows the way home.''\n\n   Although the cost remains high, some envision a day when law\nenforcement will be able to track Alzheimer's patients\nindividually. Spurred by a 1997 case of an 83-year-old man who\nwandered away from his Strafford home, sheriffs in Vermont's\nWindham and Orange Counties have begun supplying Alzheimer's\npatients with tiny transmitters which emit a signal that\nauthorities can pick up from land or air.\n\n   Meanwhile, the stress of controlling a chronic wanderer is\nabsorbed into families. Marianne Dickerman Caldwell's 83-year-old\nmother disappeared into the woods near Rindge, N.H. in 1991, and it\nwasn't until 1994 that hunters came across her remains. For that\ntime, Caldwell said, she was so fixated on the search for that a\ncounselor asked her to leave a grief support group because she was\nupsetting the other members.\n\n   ``There's just something dreadful about being unfound and out in\nthe woods,'' said Caldwell, who wrote a memoir of her mother's\ndisappearance called ``Gone ... Without a Trace.'' ``Bed is where\npeople belong.
