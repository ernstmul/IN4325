Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ In most respects, Kratz & Jensen is a sleek,\nefficient Manhattan public relations firm, with white ceiling fans,\nbrushed aluminum accents and ample windows overlooking the Flatiron\ndistrict. Look closely, however, and something altogether\nunexpected flashes by. Was that a tail?\n\n   Every Friday, the company allows staff members to bring their\ndogs to the office, and a dozen of the 50 employees arrive with a\nbriefcase in one hand and a leash in the other. David Kratz, the\nfounder, got the idea after he started bringing Derby, his standard\npoodle, to the office a couple of days a week.\n\n   ``I love it, so I think it's only fair that others can bring\ntheir dogs in, too,'' he said. ``Dogs are the perfect company men.\nThey like to be with the group. They're pack animals.''\n\n   Perhaps it was only a matter of time before the dog's snout\npushed its way into the corporate tent. The national observance\nlast month of the first Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by Pet\nSitters International, a membership group in King, N.C., suggests\noffice dogs are on the rise. After all, many offices these days are\nas formal as backyard barbecues, and Americans, who are known for\nanthropomorphizing their pets, are cosseting and training their\ndogs as never before.\n\n   Employees say they bring their dogs to work because they hate to\nleave them home alone, and they are more than willing to sacrifice\ncoffee breaks for trips to the fire hydrant. Once at the office,\nthey say, dogs help relieve stress and provide security for people\nwho keep late hours.\n\n   It can also make one's life seem less compartmentalized. ``The\ndog is my continuity _ a symbol of the seamlessness of work and\nhome and social life,'' said Barbara Brooks, the communications\ndirector at Manhattanville College in Purchase, whose Labrador\nretriever, Charlotte, can be found nestled under her desk three or\nfour days a week.\n\n   To be sure, dogs are not making their debut in the hushed,\nbutton-down environs of large investment banks and law firms. But\nthey are leaving their paw prints at smaller, more creative\ncompanies and nonprofit institutions. Some companies, like the\nonline services firm Talking Dog Media in Seattle, even have an\n``open dog policy'' as a way to attract employees.\n\n   Usually someone makes the first move: the boss or a high-ranking\nemployee arrives with dog in tow, and others follow. At\nManhattanville College, for instance, there seems to be a\ncontagion, with the dean of students bringing her cairn terrier to\nthe office, the athletic director his chow, the head librarian her\nScottish terrier, the head of health services her poodle and the\ndirector of development her dachshund.\n\n   Ms. Brooks found out about the opening for her position from the\nvice president of student affairs and dean of students, Mary\nCorrarino. The two had first met at a dog run in Manhattan. When\nMs. Brooks drove to Manhattanville for her interview, she was\nsurprised to see Annie, Ms. Corrarino's cairn terrier, in the\noffice.\n\n   ``The idea of working in higher education and living in\nWestchester County was very appealing,'' Ms. Brooks said. ``The\nnotion of having my dog curled up at my feet was terrific.''\n\n   But not everyone applauds the trend.\n\n   ``I think it's loathsome,'' said Judy Jacksina, the owner of the\nJacksina Company, a public relations firm representing Broadway and\nOff Broadway shows. ``There are so many pressures at work, and if\nyou're the other person in the office, it's not fair. Can we all\nbring cats? What about goldfish? Where does it stop?''\n\n   Most dog-friendly companies require that dogs be well mannered,\nhousebroken and free of fleas. Many employees who do not have dogs\ndo seem to genuinely enjoy having a colleague's or boss' dog\nunderfoot. Others, however, say they merely tolerate the office\nmascot.\n\n   Elizabeth Lees, the business manager of the Buddhist magazine\nTricycle, has survived a decade of dogs in her Manhattan office,\nall belonging to the editor in chief and founder, Helen Tworkov.\n\n   First there was Moses, a German shepherd who was ``affectionate\nand wise'' but who growled at Ms. Lees on her first day of work.\nThen there was Max, an ``extremely annoying and very needy''\ndachshund. Now there is Mambo, a ``big mutt with a lot of\npersonality'' who ``ran around like crazy'' in his youth.\n\n   ``As a rule, I don't like it,'' Ms. Lees said of sharing office\nspace with her boss' pet. ``While I find the dogs charming, it's\ndisruptive. We've occasionally had soiled carpets and lunches\nscarfed up.''\n\n   Human resources administrators say the practice of allowing dogs\nin the workplace can pose health risks for employees who are\nallergic to animals.\n\n   ``When do the rights of one employee begin to infringe on the\nrights of another employee?'' asked Donna M. Thiessen, past\npresident of the National Human Resources Association, a\nprofessional organization based in Milwaukee. ``You don't need your\ndog to do your job, but you do need to be free of allergic\nsymptoms. I don't know how companies balance that.''\n\n   At Talking Dog Media, the answer is simple: people averse to\ndogs need not apply. ``In the interview we ask people whether they\nlike dogs and if they are allergic to dogs,'' said Jean Miller, a\nspokeswoman for the multimedia and educational software company.\n``If you don't like dogs or you're allergic, this is not the\ncompany for you.''\n\n   Suddenly, there was a bark at her doorstep. ``No,'' Ms. Miller\ntold Zecke, a Shetland sheepdog pup. ``You have to go to your\nmommy.''\n\n   ``Mommy'' is the company president, Lisa Khatib, who began\nwelcoming all dogs after she discovered that an employee was\nleaving two bichons frises in the car. ``It's become a perk,'' Mrs.\nKhatib said. ``It did not start out that way, but it's one of those\nhappy accidents.''\n\n   While dogs are trotting off to the office, other pets, whether\ncats, birds or gerbils, continue to be left largely at home. Cats,\nof course, are commonly spotted in the city's corner bodegas and\ngreasy spoons, where they prowl for mice.\n\n   Experts say house cats in particular are much less adaptable\nthan dogs to the workplace. ``You can't take a cat daily because a\ncat is too spooked by strange environments,'' said Dr. Wallace\nSife, a Brooklyn psychologist who specializes in the loss of a pet.\n``You'd have to keep it in the cage the entire time, and the whole\npurpose of bringing a pet is for a pleasant exchange during the\nday.''\n\n   In New York City, dogs have become increasingly common sidekicks\nfor small business owners like Diane Mancher, whose public\nrelations firm, One Potato Productions, specializes in book\npublishing.\n\n   The pit bull terrier-Doberman pinscher mix makes Ms. Mancher and\nthe four account executives in her office feel protected. ``We're\nall women, and we have a lot of messengers and delivery guys,'' she\nsaid. ``Occasionally, they ask for a drink or want to use the\nbathroom. When they see the dog, they are a lot less chatty and\npushy.''\n\n   Some dogs have better attendance records than their owners. When\nthe theatrical agent Gary Krasny was out with pneumonia in April,\nhis 4-year-old bichon frise, Emma, showed up at his Times Square\noffice every day.\n\n   ``My boyfriend or a colleague would pick her up in the morning\nand take her home at night,'' he said. ``She can't stand it when\nshe stays home. She's a working dog.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Perhaps no dog has received more attention in Manhattan than\nBoomer, the golden retriever who belongs to Parks Commissioner\nHenry J. Stern. But of late, the most publicized office dog in the\ncity is Lil, a bichon-wheaten terrier mix and the constant\ncompanion of Marilyn Mode, the deputy commissioner for public\ninformation of the New York City Police Department. It seems that\nLil's every misdeed, whether swiping a lunch or nipping a\nsergeant's foot, is reported by the Newsday columnist Leonard\nLevitt, who covers the police department.\n\n   It was big news last year when an anonymous letter was sent to\nthe city's Health Department complaining of Lil's presence, and\nPolice Commissioner Howard Safir, after asking the legal department\nto look into it, then declared that Lil could stay.\n\n   ``My hours are rather unpredictable, and the commissioner\nindulges me,'' Ms. Mode said in a recent interview. But she has\ngrown weary of Levitt's sardonic scrutiny of 20-pound Lil.\n\n   ``It's like Roosevelt said about Fala,'' she said, referring to\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his beloved Scottish\nterrier. ``When FDR was accused of sending a gunboat back to pick\nup Fala, he said he was used to the press taking shots at him and\nhis family, but he resented their going after Fala. Well, Lil\nresents it, and so do I.''\n\n   MBS Associates, a marketing firm in Montrose, which promotes\nanimal adoptions and pet products, participated in last month's\nTake Your Dog to Work Day. The firm sponsored contests like ``best\ndressed,'' ``most congenial,'' ``best trick'' and ``most\nobedient.'' The president, Mal B. Schwartz, who has a mutt named\nDvorak, is thinking of allowing dogs every day.\n\n   ``The policy should be explored,'' he said. ``It adds to the\ncamaraderie around the office. People feel really good about it.\nYou know, there's more to working than getting work done.''\n","Headline":"\nTHE GROWING POPULARITY OF BRINGING DOGS TO WORK \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ In most respects, Kratz & Jensen is a sleek,\nefficient Manhattan public relations firm, with white ceiling fans,\nbrushed aluminum accents and ample windows overlooking the Flatiron\ndistrict.
