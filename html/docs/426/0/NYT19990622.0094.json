(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By WIL HAYGOOD  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   RAPID CITY, S.D. _ Glenn Jones owns three guns. He is 15- years-\nold.\n\n   With one of the guns _ that would be the .22 Ruger rifle his\nfather bought him _ the boy can bring down prairie dog at 30 yards.\n\n   Out here , in the West _ less wild these days but still wide\nopen _ that's the way it's always been and is supposed to be.\nChildren learn to shoot, and their fathers are proud to help.\n\n   Out here, fathers and sons can loll over the carcass of a dying\nanimal and get to talking about the good hunt, and about their love\nfor one another.\n\n   Out here, the guns don't get locked up. Just like the silverware\nand dishes don't get locked up.\n\n   But now, even this world is changing _ slowly, subtly,\npowerfully. It is not that after the string of schoolyard shootings\n_ from Jonesboro, Arkansas to Littleton, Colorado _ the love of\nguns has lost its grip on the people of the Black Hills. But worry\nhas crept into the relationship.\n\n   Ronn Jones, Glenn's father, is a hunter, too. But he also\nanguishes about the nuclear fallout of 1999: kids crouched behind\nweeds, licking their lips, training their eye, shooting classmates\ndown in broad daylight.\n\n   As if laws were so much dust.\n\n   As if classmates were so many prairie dogs.\n\n   And yet, the clamor about a so-called loss of innocence in\nsociety sometimes seems about as meaningful to Ronn Jones as the\ndirt flying around the Black Hills here. In his eyes, the world's\nbeen tricky and dark for a long time now.\n\n   Ronn Jones feels he knows his son better than most fathers know\ntheir sons. Feels he can predict his boy's movements, his boy's\nthoughts.\n\n   Still, there are times when he worries himself sick. He's just\none man, just one father. He trusts his son to use weapons wisely,\nbut he also fears the gathering power of violence _ of thought,\nword and imagery _ in the world Glenn will inherit. Where will all\nthe anger go?\n\n   ``Sometimes,'' the father says about the son, ``I feel that I'm\nlosing him.''\n\n   So how does a father raise a son enamored of guns and the\nculture that surrounds them?\n\n   This is how Ronn Jones does it: He plows into his son's life.\nWhen necessary, he tries to bearhug the anger out of his boy.\n(itals)Talk to me, Glenn. Talk. To. Me.(unitals)\n\n   He uses his own story to try to connect.\n\n   ``I still remember what it's like to be a teenager,'' Ronn Jones\nis saying. ``I can feel the pressure of wanting to fit in. My dad\nwas one of the best dads ever. I lost him when he was 63. Much too\nearly.''\n\n   You can travel through the bright mornings and dark nights of\nthe Dakotas _ so desolate, so legendary _ and wonder what an angry\nchild might do if provoked.\n\n   ``When a kid says, `I'm going to kill so and so,' well, you need\nto find out what the kid means,'' Ronn says.\n\n   ``We keep the line of communication open,'' he says of his\nrelationship with Glenn. ``When a child makes a sweeping statement\n_ `I'm going to kill that guy' _ that's a demand for attention.''\n\n   The father says he gets dizzy sizing up the world in which we\nlive. ``I know what to expect from the real hoodlum, but nobody\nknows what to expect from the Ted Kaczynskis. They have an agenda.\nSome of these kids _ in Littleton, in Jonesboro _ they were quiet\nones to.''\n\n   Let Glenn Jones come home from school mumbling, hunching his\nshoulders, banging cabinets before slamming his bedroom door, and\nhe'll get a whoosh of his father, right in his face, eyeball to\neyeball.\n\n   ``I can tell what kind of day he's having from the moment I say\nhi to him,'' Ronn says. ``If it comes down to it, I'll take him in\nmy bathroom and stay in his face until I get something.''\n\n   Ronn is a night security manager for an area hotel. Over the\nyears he'd listen to other adults ridiculing kids, shaking their\nheads about their manner of dress. They'd just be kids swimming\nthrough the Rapid City night _ in black trench coats, wearing rings\nin their noses, often stamped with tattoos. The so-called rebels,\nmisfits. But somebody's children.\n\n   Some would walk by Ronn Jones staring like owls. He'd strike up\nconversations. So many reminded them of his own son.\n\n   ``I got kicked out of high school once,'' he says. ``I know what\nit feels like to be an outcast.''\n\n   Ronn Jones grew up in South Dakota. His father and uncles helped\nput the finishing touches on Mount Rushmore, 35 miles outside town.\nHe fought in Vietnam and came home with a Purple Heart. He married\nKerry, who already had children. They had Glenn together. But two\nof the stepchildren _ boys _ got out of the house without getting\ntheir high school diplomas. He didn't like that. They'd listen to\nhim all right. But then they'd go their own way.\n\n   Ronn vows it'll be different with Glenn. ``I still got input\nwith him,'' he says.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Father and son are seated around the living room table.
