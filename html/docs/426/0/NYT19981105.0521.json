Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the\nnight from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the\nseries of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new\nhard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages,\nJames Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him, according\nto former leaders of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of\nanonymity.\n\n   And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day\nof Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into\njail. Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue\nmembers, according to some people who were there, Kopp remained in\njail for 40 days and adhered to Terry's orders not to give a real\nname to the police or courts.\n\n   After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's\nBinghamton headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as\nthe group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement\nsurged in late 1988 and 1989, according to the former leaders of\nOperation Rescue.\n\n   Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement\nauthorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of\nan obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo region.\n\n   The authorities also say he may have information that will help\nsolve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions\nin Canada and upstate New York.

In fact, the announcement that\nlaw enforcement officials are looking for him has been made as\nAttorney General Janet Reno has prepared to revive an interagency\ntask force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind\nanti-abortion crimes.\n\n   Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp\nis not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed\nDr. Barnett A.
