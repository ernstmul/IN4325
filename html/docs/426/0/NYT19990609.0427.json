Woodson\n      c. 1999 Cox News Service\n\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ School educators, used to dealing with endless\ndemands of better grades and higher test scores, say more and more\nthey're spending their time worrying about safety.\n\n   ``Since the Colorado shooting, safety is issue number one in the\nminds of the administrators I've talked to,'' said Mike Wallace,\nprincipal of Bastrop Middle School.\n\n   That's why it's also among the top topics at this week's\nthree-day summer workshop of the Texas Association of Secondary\nSchool Principals at the Austin Convention Center, which runs\nthrough Friday. There 1,500 principals and educators are talking\nabout a variety of issues, from creating better learning\nenvironments to connecting schools with families and communities.\n\n   Among the 99 seminars being offered, more than a dozen address\nsafety issues, including sessions on drug and bomb-sniffing dogs,\nlockerless schools, and managing a crisis at a school. Although\nmany principals say they already had safety plans in place before\nthe April shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,\nthey say they are reassessing those plans.\n\n   Retired FBI agent Max Howard, one of the speakers at the\nworkshop, said he can attest to schools' increased interest in\nsafety. Howard owns a crisis management training firm that develops\ncrisis plans for both businesses and schools.\n\n   ``My involvement has been more since Columbine,'' he said. ``We\nrecognize that there is a level of violence among young people, as\nwith all people. The process I'm going to use is taking the skills\nthat law enforcement use when handling a particular situation, and\napplying those skills to what a school administrators can use with\nirate students.''\n\n   Although some Austin schools had crisis management plans in\nplace before the Columbine shooting in Littleton, Colo.,\nadministrators like Lanier High School Assistant Principal Wayne\nSkrhak said the incident prompted them to take a second look.\n\n   ``We're probably a little more cautious,'' Skrhak said. ``We're\nmore watchful, we listen more carefully. We tell teachers to let us\nknow when they have that gut level feeling. When we have events\nlike Columbine, you're more cautious, it puts us on alert.''\n\n   Skrhak, who spoke at a seminar on gangs, said Lanier encourages\nstudents to report possible safety violations. Students are\nsometimes given monetary awards, and can remain anonymous.\n\n   ``People watching and people reporting makes a big difference,''\nhe said. ``When you have a large majority trained on what to look\nfor, you can head off situations before they head to something\nelse.''\n\n   Austin High School Assistant Principal Bill Glover said safety\nconcerns are also foremost in the minds of parents and students.\nTwo days this spring, he said, a lot of their students refused to\ncome to class after hearing rumors of possible copycat incidents of\nthe Columbine shootings.\n\n   ``After Columbine, there were heightened concerns,'' he said.\n``Through communications and being very honest with the students,\nit got away a lot of the fear.''\n\n   Glover said security now makes more frequent sweeps of their\nbuildings, and they take a closer look at suspicious looking\nobjects. Glover said this year, one set of brass knuckle and a few\nknives were collected from students.\n\n   Despite rising safety concerns, the Center for Public Policy\nPriorities reports that juvenile violent crime in Texas is actually\ndeclining. A recent study states that since 1994, the arrest rates\nfor all juvenile violent crimes has declined.\n\n   Administrators told their peers that monitoring what students\nbring into the school building is a big part of the battle.\n\n   Wallace, of Bastrop Middle School, moderated a session on using\ndogs to detect contraband. Wallace said he regularly uses trained\nschool dogs to survey his campus of 950 students.\n\n   Unlike drug dogs, school dogs are trained to detect a variety of\nsubstances such as illicit drugs, alcohol and gunpowder- based\nweapons.\n\n   Granger Independent School District Superintendent James\nBartosh, who in another session presented the idea of a lockerless\nschool, said he still marvels at education's growing focus on\nincreased security. ``We would wear our holsters and toy guns to\nschool and nobody thought a thing about it,'' he said. ``I had a\nfourth grader bring a cap gun to school and we had to get the gun\nto the county (law enforcement) because they had been notified that\nwe had a gun at our school. It's almost ridiculous, but what do you\ndo, you can't respond any other way? We all just have to be\ncareful.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ School educators, used to dealing with endless\ndemands of better grades and higher test scores, say more and more\nthey're spending their time worrying about safety.\n","\n   ``Since the Colorado shooting, safety is issue number one in the\nminds of the administrators I've talked to,'' said Mike Wallace,\nprincipal of Bastrop Middle School.\n","\n   That's why it's also among the top topics at this week's\nthree-day summer workshop of the Texas Association of Secondary\nSchool Principals at the Austin Convention Center, which runs\nthrough Friday.
