But\nafter driving around for a while in downtown Grain Valley without\nseeing an officer, they decided to go home.\n\n   By 8:30 p.m. Nelson had arrived at his mother's home in Kansas\nCity, Mo. They spoke briefly, talking about work and the weather.\n\n   At 10 p.m. Nelson was seen coming out of the basement of the\nhouse with another white male.

Nelson, called\nThe Kansas City Star to complain about the treatment her son was\nreceiving.\n\n   ``This is awful,'' the 43-year-old woman said. ``It's like\nvigilante time, you know?
