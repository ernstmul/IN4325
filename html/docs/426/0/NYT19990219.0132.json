But something funny happens. Those number-crunching\nactuarial types at your insurance company think Bowser is more of a\nliability than an asset.\n\n   Are they crazy?\n\n   Not exactly. We are experiencing an epidemic of dog bites in\nthis country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta estimates that as many as 4.7 million people are bitten\neach year, 1 million of them require medical treatment, and 334,000\nend up in the emergency room. About a dozen people a year die from\ndog attacks. The Journal of the American Medical Association\nestimates that almost half of all children will be bitten before\nreaching age 12. It is the No. 1 health problem among children.\n\n   According to Loretta Worters, spokeswoman for the Insurance\nInformation Institute, all that adds up to a whopping price tag of\n$1 billion a year, $250 million of that shelled out in medical and\nliability payments by insurance companies. Dog attacks now account\nfor one third of all homeowners' insurance liability claims. And\nthe insurers are not wagging their tails over it.\n\n   What are they doing about it? ``Insurance companies are all over\nthe block on this issue,'' says Frank O'Brien, regional manager of\nthe Alliance of American Insurers. Some companies deny coverage in\ncertain cases. Some may add a higher premium. Some don't treat dog\nowners any differently than others. And many try to sort it out by\nsizing up risk according to statistics.\n\n   Betsy Bottiano, of Liberty Mutual Group, says her company does\nhave a list of certain breeds they would call ``unbindable.'' Cases\npresenting these dogs _ pit bulls and American Staffordshire\nterriers; Doberman pinschers; Rottweilers; German shepherds; chows;\nwolves and wolf hybrids _ would have to be reviewed by an\nunderwriter. (Though the American Kennel Club may differentiate\nbetween pit bulls and American Staffordshire terriers, most\ninsurance companies do not.) Siberian huskies, Alaskan malamutes,\nGreat Danes, Saint Bernards, and Akitas appear on other companies'\nlists, too.\n\n   If someone owns a breed from the red-flag list, Liberty Mutual\nwould ask more extensive questions concerning the dog's history,\ntraining, gender, sexual status (neutered or spayed?), intent of\nownership, presence of children, and precautions (is the yard\nfenced, for example).\n\n   What's interesting here is that many of these factors are\nexactly the ones that animal welfare organizations have warned\nowners about for years. Aggressive dogs tend to be young,\nunneutered males who have been poorly socialized. Also, the most\nlikely victim of an aggressive dog is not a burglar, but the owner,\nthe owner's children or the neighbors. As Worters and many dog\ntrainers say, having a big, aggressive dog around without proper\ntraining (of the owner as well as the dog) can be as risky as\n``having a loaded shotgun'' in the house.\n\n   What dog experts have cautioned is exactly what insurance data\nconfirms. And as more and more owners ignore warnings and purchase\nfierce creatures instead of companions, the bite statistics soar.\n\n   Consider this: While dog attacks have grown by 37 percent in a\ndecade (1986-1996), the actual dog population has only grown by 2\npercent.\n\n   We all know lovely German shepherds or sweet Doberman pinschers.\nBreed banning is no solution, though most insurance companies\nsimply raise a flag with certain breeds and look into the matter.\nHere, again, the insurance world is in agreement with dog experts:\nWorters says, ``Insurance companies believe that the ownership,\nrather than the breed, per se, is the problem.''\n\n   ``This should serve as a wake-up call,'' says nationally known\ndog trainer Brian Kilcommons, ``because the few are going to ruin\nthings for the many.
