Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,\nsaid during a Senate Judiciary panel hearing on the issue. Kyl,\nchairman of the Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information\nSubcommittee, estimates more than $1 billion will be gambled over\nthe Internet this year.\n\n   ``Internet gambling enhances the addictive nature of gambling\nbecause it is so easy to do. You don't have to travel. You can just\nlog on to your computer,'' he said.\n\n   Legal gambling is a $50 billion annual industry that includes\ncasinos, slot machines, state lotteries and horse and dog-track\nracing. It is regulated by states that have varying laws on\ngambling.\n\n   State attorneys general have asked Congress for a federal ban on\nInternet gambling because they argue they cannot police such\nactivity on a global network that defies state borders. They say\nthey cannot enforce Internet gambling even if states have their own\nlaws that ban such activity.\n\n   ``Gambling is already one of the most regulated industries in\nthe world, yet the Internet of one of the most heavily unregulated\nand inherently difficult phenomena to regulate in modern time,''\nsaid Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery.\n\n   The most popular form of Internet wagering is sports betting,\nbut casino-type games are becoming more popular as the Internet\nbecomes faster.\n\n   Current federal law makes placing a bet or sending gambling\ninformation over telephone lines illegal, but the 1961 law predates\nthe Internet. Most computer users connect to the Internet through\nphone lines but it is also possible to use cable television lines\nand satellites, technically skirting federal law.\n\n   ``In effect the Internet creates a loophole in gambling laws,''\nsaid Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\n\n   Last year the Justice Department charged 21 owners and managers\nof Internet gambling firms with illegally violating the 1961\ntelephone law, but law enforcement officials say the federal law\nstill needs updating to give authorities a good chance of\nsuccessfully prosecuting Internet gambling operators. Eight people\npleaded guilty, one is fighting the charges and the others remain\nat-large.\n\n   Kyl plans to reintroduce legislation this week that would ban\ngambling on the Internet. It would impose fines equal to the amount\nthat a business received over the Internet or $20,000, whichever is\ngreater, and impose prison sentences of up to four years on those\nconvicted.\n\n   The bill also would require Internet providers such as America\nOnline to cut service for any illegal gambling site upon a state or\nfederal court order. The Senate passed a similar bill 90-10 last\nyear but the issue never made it to the House floor. House\nlawmakers are also expected to reintroduce the legislation this\nyear.\n\n   Bill Saum, the director of agent and gambling activities at the\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, said Internet gambling is\nattracting growing numbers of students who place sports wagers on\nthe Internet with credit cards.\n\n   ``A growing consensus of research reveals that the rates of\npathological and problems gambling among college students are\nhigher than any other segment of the population,'' Saum said. Many\ncollege students have access to the Internet as well as easy access\nto credit cards that are marketed on campuses.\n\n   Internet gambling sites typically require people to open an\naccount by providing a credit card number. Most sites require a\ndeposit of about $250 in order to play. Bets on sports teams, for\nexample, can range from 25 cents to hundreds of dollars. Betting\nlosses are charged to the credit card while winnings are posted as\ncredits, although in some cases gamblers report that they never\nreceived their winnings.\n\n   People can also play poker, blackjack and a variety of other\ncard and dice games with the click of a computer mouse.\n\n   There are almost 300 Internet gambling sites, up from about 15\njust two years ago and recent studies have suggested that people\nare increasingly becoming addicted to Internet gambling.\n\n   Kyl and other lawmakers admit that federal legislation won't\nstop all Internet gambling, especially in cases where gambling\noperators set up shop overseas, which is a common practice.\nCountries like Antigua, Costa Rica and Grenada license Internet\ngambling sites.\n\n   Montgomery argued that a federal ban on Internet gambling would\nstill be useful because ``a public stance of prohibition tells\nconsumers that they should be extremely wary of Internet\ngambling.''\n","Headline":"\nLAWMAKERS PUSH BAN ON INTERNET GAMBLING \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers renewed a push Tuesday to enact\nlegislation that would ban gambling over the Internet under\npressure from state law enforcement officials.\n","\n   Internet gambling is estimated to be a $600 million per year\nbusiness and is growing.\n","\n   ``Internet gambling is a serious issue,'' Sen.
