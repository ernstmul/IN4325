FINKELSTEIN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ With complaints of noise threatening the future of\nthe city's largest dog run, more than 30 dog owners and their pets\nturned out at Theodore Roosevelt Park here Saturday to protest\nquietly and show how well-behaved their dogs could be.\n\n   But despite coaching from a dog behaviorist, the efforts of a\nnoise-reduction subcommittee and signs urging silence, barking\nbroke out at Teddy's Dog Run on the north side of the Museum of\nNatural History.\n\n   Mickey, a muddy sheepdog, yelped when a Labrador retriever eyed\nthe Nerf football clenched in his jaws. Despite frantic shushing\nfrom owners, the dogs noisily greeted a neighbor known for\ndistributing snacks.\n\n   The howling seemed only to heighten the tension between the dog\nowners and the residents on 81st Street.\n\n   ``There's a constant barking sound which explodes at least once\nan hour into snarling and yelping,'' said Jack Flam as he glared at\nthe dog run from his sixth-floor apartment.\n\n   The battle over the dog run has pitted a community board and a\nblock association against the dog owners, who have formed their own\ngroup, Friends of Museum Park Dog Run. It started when the Parks\nDepartment began a multimillion-dollar effort to restore and\nlandscape the museum's grounds and in the process, upgrade the dog\nrun.\n\n   The run is now a 13,000 square-foot dust pit surrounded by\nchicken wire. The plan calls for the run to be moved closer to the\nmuseum wall, to be filled in with pea gravel and to be surrounded\nby shrubbery to muffle sound.\n\n   But the 81st Street Block Association said that the barking\nwould reverberate against the museum wall, making it even louder,\nand that the dogs would muck up a cultural gem.\n\n   The association made an alternate proposal to move the dog run\nto 77th Street and Central Park West, and offered the Parks\nDepartment $150,000 to relocate it. On Feb. 12, it submitted the\nproposal to Community Board 7.\n\n   On March 2, the community board voted to hold off on approving\nthe plan to upgrade the existing dog run. The dog owners countered\nwith a resolution to save the original run but to strictly enforce\nrules against houndish behavior.\n\n   The community board is to vote on whether to approve the Parks\nDepartment's dog run plan on April 6, so the dogs turned out\nSaturday to parade their manners. But Flam, a member of the block\nassociation and the community board, was far from satisfied. ``We\nare one block away from Central Park, the largest park in the\ncity,'' he said. ``Why does anyone have to come over here and bark\nunder our windows?''\n\n   It makes sense to have the dog run next to the museum, said\nMichael Pennachias, the sheepdog owner who is heading the group's\npublic relations effort. ``Dogs have been a part of natural history\nfor thousands of years,'' he pointed out.\n","Headline":"\nBARKING ERUPTS AT SILENT RALLY TO SAVE CITY'S LARGEST DOG RUN  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ With complaints of noise threatening the future of\nthe city's largest dog run, more than 30 dog owners and their pets\nturned out at Theodore Roosevelt Park here Saturday to protest\nquietly and show how well-behaved their dogs could be.\n","\n   But despite coaching from a dog behaviorist, the efforts of a\nnoise-reduction subcommittee and signs urging silence, barking\nbroke out at Teddy's Dog Run on the north side of the Museum of\nNatural History.\n","\n   Mickey, a muddy sheepdog, yelped when a Labrador retriever eyed\nthe Nerf football clenched in his jaws.
