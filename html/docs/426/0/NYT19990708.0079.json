But to\nhelp jump start a health search, here are some suggestions for\nsites of proven usefulness, reliability and ease of use.\n\n   There are two basic reasons to begin a health search: Either you\nor someone you know is sick and you want to learn everything you\ncan about the illness, or you're in good health and you're looking\nfor information or products to help stay that way.\n\n   Let's start with illness as a motivation and then move to the\nwellness search. Addresses for all Web sites mentioned are listed\nin an accompanying chart.\n\n   As a biotech reporter, I constantly encounter new ailments. My\nfirst stop on many stories is Citeline.com, a San Francisco service\nthat lets people search for information about virtually any\ndisease. It provides definitions, articles about the latest\ntreatments and other facts to get you up to speed in a hurry.\n\n   Citeline.com sells an advanced version of its database to drug\nand biotech firms, so the information is high caliber. But the\nbasic service is, and will remain, free, said marketing director\nJohn Parker.\n\n   Finding Doctors\n\n   Once you've found out a bit about your disease, you might want\nto look for a physician who specializes in its treatment. The\nAmerican Medical Association maintains a nationwide directory of\nphysicians that you can search by specialty and state.\n\n   Of course, your choice of physician is probably limited by your\nhealth plan. But it may be useful to know where you can turn for a\nsecond opinion. The AMA page has another great advantage. It\nreveals where a doctor went to school, did a residency and earned\ncredentials _ tools that can help you learn more about any\nphysician you encounter.\n\n   It's a rare ailment that isn't treated by some form of\nmedication. PharmInfoNet is a great place to learn about\nprescription drugs, their side effects and possible interactions.\n\n   Visit the site. Click on drug info. Type in the name of your\nmedication. PharmInfo will pull up a list of articles that mention\nthe drug. No telling what you'll find, but you will learn what has\nbeen written about the drugs you take.\n\n   To test the system, I typed in Neoral, one brand name for a drug\nthat transplant patients take on a daily basis. Up popped an\narticle about how grapefruit juice interacts with a number of\nmedications to dramatically increase their effect on the body _\nsurely a good thing to know!\n\n   Support From Others\n\n   One way people cope with disease is by joining support groups.\nPeople who've been there and done that are often the best sources\nof solace and information. Your physician may steer you to a local\nsupport group. People who suffer from common ailments, like\ndiabetes or heart disease, can easily find support groups through\nthe American Diabetes Association or the American Heart\nAssociation.\n\n   But it's harder for those with rare or genetic diseases to find\npeople with similar experiences. Fortunately, the University of\nKansas Medical Center posts an A-to-Z support group directory for\neverything from Acoustic Neuroma (a loss of hearing) to Xeroderma\nPigmentosum (extreme sensitivity to sunlight).\n\n   When other sources of information fail, try HealthFinder.\nMaintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, this Web\nsite provides a simple way to find the health information that\npours out of government agencies like the National Institutes of\nHealth or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n   The nicest thing about HealthFinder is its simplicity.

Many of these sites also contain useful\ninformation about diseases, but their focus is on how to stay\nhealthy.\n\n   At the top of my list would be the Web sites maintained or\nsponsored by research centers. The Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, two noted medical research centers, both sponsor\nexcellent pages aimed at laypeople.\n\n   Of course, you'll be able to find information about diseases and\ndrugs on either page, but the emphasis is on ways to avoid disease\nthrough diet and exercise.\n\n   For instance, clicking on ``nutrition'' on the Mayo Clinic site\nleads ultimately to a heart-healthy menu plan emphasizing fish over\nmeat. Headlines on the Johns Hopkins page talk about how to relieve\nthe stress of caring for an elderly parent. These pages approach\nhealth in a holistic way, encompassing everything from attitude to\nbehavior.\n\n   A plethora of commercial Web sites have sprung up that dispense\nhealth information while trying to sell you products or services to\nmaintain your health.\n\n   Sorting the reputable sites from the snake oil vendors is\ndifficult.

In addition to providing access to medical\nencyclopedias, disease directories, and basic nutrition and health\ninformation, the site gives you a chance to buy cancer insurance or\njoin a weight-loss plan that promises to help you lose 10 pounds in\n30 days.\n\n   If your interests run toward alternative medicine,\nHealthGate.com is another commercial Web site that won FTC\naccolades.
