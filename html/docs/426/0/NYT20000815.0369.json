Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down part of\na government order that had broadly expanded the ability of\nlaw-enforcement agents to monitor cell phone conversations of\ncriminal suspects.\n\n   The decision was considered a partial victory by privacy groups\nthat had challenged the order and was a clear setback for law\nenforcement agencies, which must now consider revising the rules\nfor electronic surveillance of wireless communications.\n\n   Still, the decision by the the appeals court here gave the\nauthorities some of what they had sought. It upheld a provision of\nthe order that enabled federal agents to determine the general\nlocation of a cell phone user by identifying which phone-company\nantenna was used to transmit the beginning and end of a call.\n\n   The opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit, which set out important statutory and\nconstitutional parameters for electronic surveillance, suggested\nthat agents seeking to monitor the location of suspects through\ncell phones must first meet a high burden of proof to obtain a\nwarrant.\n\n   The court struck down a provision of the year-old order by the\nFederal Communications Commission that had required companies to\ninstall equipment to detect telephone tones after a call is placed,\nenabling agents to monitor the use of cell phones to make banking\ntransactions, get voice-mail messages, or send paging messages.\n\n   It also struck comparable provisions that had required the\ncompanies to install equipment to enable law enforcement agents to\nmonitor conference calls, call forwarding, call waiting and\nmessages left on cell phones.\n\n   The appeal was filed last year by a coalition of telephone\nindustry groups that had complained that the government order was\ntoo costly to implement and privacy rights organizations that said\nthe order had violated the constitutional rights of cell phone\nusers.\n\n   The Federal Communications Commission issued the order last\nAugust in an attempt to make it easier for law enforcement\nauthorities to monitor conversations on cell phones.\n\n   The agency issued the order after years of fruitless\nnegotiations by the government, industry and privacy groups to\nimplement a 1994 law, the Communications Assistance for Law\nEnforcement Act.\n\n   That law required telephone companies and equipment makers to\nbuild their networks in a way that enabled law enforcement to\nintercept certain kinds of communications. It also imposed privacy\ncontraints and ordered regulators to implement standards in manner\nthat was least costly to industry.\n\n   The issue posed by the appeal, U.S. Telecom Association v.\nFederal Communications Commission, was whether the agency, in\nissuing the order, exceeded its authority or failed to consider\nprivacy concerns and the financial costs of the new standards\nadequately.\n\n   In an opinion written by Judge David S. Tatel and joined by\nJudges Douglas H. Ginsburg and A. Raymond Randolph, the appeals\ncourt found that in four instances that the FCC had failed to\nexplain the basis for its order properly. The judges also found\nthat the commission had failed to examine whether the standards\nwere too costly.\n\n   The court also said that when the commission required that the\ncompanies install equipment to monitor tones after phone calls are\nmade, the agency failed to consider the possible privacy\nimplications of its decision.\n\n   Justice Department lawyers had defended the provision on the\ngrounds that after a telephone call is made, some callers use\n``dial-around'' services like 1-800-CALL-ATT to then charge long\ndistance calls, a procedure that can be used to circumvent\nsurveillance.\n\n   But the court accepted the concerns the privacy groups had that\nthe effect of the standard was to permit agents to also monitor\nsuch activities as banking and paging by using the keyboard of a\ncell phone.\n\n   Lawyers on both sides of the case said that they had not decided\nwhether they would appeal Tuesday's ruling. If it is not appealed,\nthen the FCC must begin new proceedings to reconsider and possibly\nrewrite its rules.\n\n   In the interim, government lawyers said, law enforcement\nagencies will be constrained in their ability to monitor certain\nkinds of communications through cell phones.\n\n   The decision comes amid growing concern by some lawmakers and\nprivacy groups that the government has been increasing its\nelectronic surveillance, and by competing concerns at the Federal\nBureau of Investigation that cannot keep up with advances in\ntechnology.\n\n   In recent months, that debate has focused on a new computer\napplication called Carnivore that the FBI says it uses to sift\nthrough millions of e-mail in order to monitor communications of\ncriminal suspects.\n\n   Although Tuesday's decision did not directly address the issues\nposed by the use of Carnivore, some privacy experts said that it\nhad important implications for how that computer application was\nbeing used. The opinion generally upheld government surveillance of\ndigital communications through cell phones, a technology similar to\nwhat is used for e-mail. As such, the opinion suggested\nsurveillance of e-mail would also be upheld.\n\n   But the court also reiterated that to monitor the content of\nthose communications, federal agents must meet the same legal\nstandard as traditional wiretaps, and that innovative kinds of\nsurveillance cannot be used to circumvent those rules.\n\n   ``This imposes significant privacy protections on the use of\nthese capabilities and requires law enforcement to meet the highest\nlegal standards before using them,'' said David Sobel, general\ncounsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a\nprivacy-rghts group that was one of the organizations that had\nchallenged the rules.\n","Headline":"\nCOURT LIMITS MONITORING OF CELL PHONES BY LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENTS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down part of\na government order that had broadly expanded the ability of\nlaw-enforcement agents to monitor cell phone conversations of\ncriminal suspects.\n","\n   The decision was considered a partial victory by privacy groups\nthat had challenged the order and was a clear setback for law\nenforcement agencies, which must now consider revising the rules\nfor electronic surveillance of wireless communications.\n","\n   Still, the decision by the the appeals court here gave the\nauthorities some of what they had sought.
