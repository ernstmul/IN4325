Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 4:\n\n   In trying to prevent criminals from using new electronic\ntechnologies in illegal activities, the Clinton administration has\nbeen deaf to the privacy concerns of law-abiding citizens. The\nJustice Department argues that electronic surveillance by the\ngovernment would hurt only those involved in crime, not the\nlaw-abiding citizen. But erosions of privacy affect all Americans.\nAs more people use computers and new technology to communicate and\nconduct business, balancing the need to protect electronic privacy\nagainst law enforcement requirements is crucial.\n\n   Two recent examples show the administration's failure to achieve\na good balance. The Justice Department has drafted legislation that\nwould authorize federal law enforcement officers, with\ncourt-approved warrants, to secretly enter a suspect's home or\noffice to disable encryption programs on their personal computers\nor install devices that can allow investigators to read the\nencrypted text. The intent is to thwart the ability of criminals to\nconceal information. But the threat to civil liberties may become\nsubstantial as encryption on personal computers becomes common.\n\n   Under current wiretap law, law enforcement agencies can seek\ncourt authorization to tap phone lines or to place hidden\nmicrophones in private buildings. More than 1,000 wiretaps are\napproved by courts annually, though requests for warrants to use\nhidden microphones are rare. Civil liberties groups are worried\nthat surreptitious entry would become far more common if the\ndisabling of encryption were to become standard practice whenever a\nsuspect is thought to use a computer.\n\n   Last week the Federal Communications Commission, at the urging\nof the Justice Department, adopted new rules making it easier for\nlaw enforcement agencies to monitor the movement of callers using\ncellular phones. The regulations require that phone companies be\ncapable of providing general location information at the beginning\nand end of any cellular call under surveillance with a court order.\nTurning cell phones into tracking devices is an unwarranted\nexpansion of surveillance power.\n\n   The new requirements would also give government agents the\nability, applying to both cell phones and ordinary phones, to\ncontinue monitoring conference calls even after the surveillance\ntarget drops off the call and allow them to determine whether a\nsuspect is using features like call forwarding and call waiting.\nEach of these changes may appear limited in scope. But taken\ntogether, these policies unduly erode privacy protections in the\nelectronic realm.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 4:\n","\n   In trying to prevent criminals from using new electronic\ntechnologies in illegal activities, the Clinton administration has\nbeen deaf to the privacy concerns of law-abiding citizens.
