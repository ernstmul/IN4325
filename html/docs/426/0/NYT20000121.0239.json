Their\ninitiative would allow low-level drug dealers to receive treatment\ninstead of jail time, and make it tougher for law enforcement\nofficials to seize assets from those accused of drug crimes.\n\n   AT&T has so far poured $1 million into a campaign to fight a\nballot measure that would require it and other cable firms to open\ntheir lines to competitors. Grace Internet Capital, the owner of\nseveral Internet companies, spent $600,000 to get the law on the\nballot next November.\n\n   Fidelity Investments, which is trying to promote charitable\ngiving, spent $175,000 to win a spot for a state income tax\ndeduction for charitable donations. Putnam Investments kicked in\nanother $25,000.\n\n   Government watchdogs say they are alarmed at the role\ncorporations and out-of-state financial interests are playing in\nthe upcoming election, bypassing the Legislature and its public\nhearing process.\n\n   In fact, this election cycle appears to mark the completion of a\nshift which began in 1994 and transformed the initiative petition\nprocess from voluntary citizens efforts to well-financed operations\nof paid signature gatherers.\n\n   Even anti-tax leader Barbara Anderson and her followers, once\nthe model for citizen participation in the initiative process, had\nto rely on Governor Paul Cellucci and other Republicans to raise\nfunds to pay a Nevada firm $100,000 to collect signatures for the\nmeasure to cut the income tax. A citizens' effort in 1998 failed to\ngather enough signatures to qualify.\n\n   The only true grass-roots drive to win a ballot spot this cycle\nappears to be the campaign to ban dog racing in Massachusetts.\nThose advocates gathered 83,526 signatures -- well above the\nnecessary 57,000 required to qualify for the ballot -- but only\nspent $330 to do so.\n\n   Pillsbury said the initiative petition process was created early\nin the last century to allow citizens, who were frustrated by\nlegislative inaction, to take their cases directly to the voters.\n\n   But he said the framers of the constitutional amendment made the\nprocess ``intentionally burdensome'' so that it would not be used\nfrivolously. He said they also envisioned it to be a voluntary\ncitizens enterprise.\n\n   ``Now, what we're seeing with these professional signature\ngathering firms, is the burdened removed,'' Pillsbury said.\n\n   The ballot proposals for this year offer dramatic changes.\nSoros' measure in particular is raising strong concern from law\nenforcements officials.\n\n   Michael Sullivan, the district attorney in Plymouth County, said\nthe proposal would create legal loopholes for drug dealers and\ntraffickers to escape punishment.\n\n   ``This would be a huge setback,'' Sullivan said, saying the\nstate's tough drug laws have contributed heavily to the crime rate\ndecline.\n\n   The law would allow a defendants to declare themselves at risk\nof becoming drug addicted and ask a judge to send them to a drug\ntreatment program rather than jail. It would also make it more\ndifficult for law enforcement to force the forfeiture of money and\nproperty in low-level drug crimes.\n\n   Sullivan and other law enforcment officials say they are\nconvinced that Soros' campaign is aimed at eventually legalizing\nmarijuana and lowering the penalities for trafficking. ``This\nbecomes the first step toward decriminalizing drug dealing,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Soros and the other two financiers -- Phoenix businessman John\nSperling and Peter Lewis, a Cleveland insurance executive -- have\nnot advocated legalizing drugs. But they have bankrolled efforts\naround the country to ease drug laws. For example they have\nfinanced campaigns to allow for the medicinal use of marijuana.\n\n   Robert Stewart, a spokesman for Soros' Massachusetts-sponsored\ncampaign, dispute Sullivan assertion that the ballot question would\nlead to decriminalization of drugs.\n\n   ``It doesn't gut the anti-drug laws,'' Stewart said. ``It raises\nthe bar for civil fortfeitures. There will still be seizures and\nforfeitures on the criminal side.''\n\n   Stewart said the proposed changes in the drug laws would only\napply to small-time dealers and trafickers. He said sentencing\ndiscretion is left to judges, and the law would screen virtually\nall violent and serious criminals out of the process.\n\n   Pillsbury believes the petiton process has become so corrupted\nby big money interests that the state needs a law banning the use\npaid signature gathers. But that may be legally dubious. A similar\nban in Colorado was thrown out by the courts.\n\n   ``We have to go back to the framers' original intentions, that\nit be only a bona fide citizens movement,'' Pillsbury said.\n","Headline":"\n`BIG MONEY' CORRUPTING BAY STATE BALLOT ISSUES, CRITICS WARN \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Big money donors and corporations are pouring money\ninto Massachusetts to create sweeping new laws through the ballot\nprocess, a development that is alarming reformers who say the\ninitiative petition system is being corrupted.\n","\n   ``You used to just buy a car or electronic equipment, but now\nyou can buy a law,'' said George Pillsbury, executive director of\nthe Massachusetts Money and Politics Project, a group which\nmonitors campaign financing and expenditures.\n","\n   George Soros, a New York financier, and two wealthy donors from\nOhio and Arizona contributed nearly $400,000 to hire signature\ngatherers to win a spot on the ballot for a drug measure.
