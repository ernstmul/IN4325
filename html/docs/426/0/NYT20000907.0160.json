O'Brien\n      c. 2000 Cox News Service\n\n   WACO, Texas - Anything outside of pampering a dog these days\nseems almost uncivilized.\n\n   As Americans, we treat our furry friends like royalty. They're\ngroomed and bathed at special salons, fed premium food and given\nChristmas gifts. They sleep in our beds and spend their days at pet\nday care while we slave away at work.\n\n   In fact, city leaders in Boulder, Colo., recently passed a law\nnaming pet ``owners'' as pet ``guardians.'' But are all these\nthings really necessary to give Fido and Fluffy a good life?\n\n   ``One of my clients has a dog that goes to the beauty shop every\nFriday to be groomed,'' said Marilyn Harkness, owner of pet-sitting\nbusiness in Waco. ``He has a standing appointment.''\n\n   Most pet owners consider their cats and dogs to be part of the\nfamily, according to the American Animal Hospitals Association. But\nlet's be honest _ some are treated even better.\n\n   When was the last time Buster was told he had to finish his\nplate before dessert? Don't think dogs get dessert? Hundreds of\nbakeries catering to pet palates have opened across the country\nduring the last few years. Now, Fido can kick the monotony of Alpo,\nAlpo, Alpo. Want to see that tail wag? Let him sink those K-9s into\nsome wheat germ bonbons covered with crushed peanuts or carrot\ncupcakes or cinnamon and carob biscuits.\n\n   All this pampering and primping of our four-legged friends has\nsome people wondering, though, exactly who owns whom _ who's\nholding the leash and who's being led by it.\n\n   Derek Woodbury, public-relations manager for the animal\nhospitals association, said pets will always be at the beck and\ncall of their human masters. No matter how easy a dog's life may\nseem, pets will always be property.\n\n   But that isn't always so bad, he conceded.\n\n   ``I think all that (pampering) reinforces the high value people\nplace on their pets,'' Woodbury said. ``There is a very serious\nbond there.''\n\n   The Boulder law, which passed in July, emphasizes the status of\npets as living beings _ not simply property and is designed to curb\nthe abuse and neglect of animals. But councilman Gordon Riggle, the\nlone opponent of the measure, said he sees the change as simply a\nfeel-good move with no legal consequences, and that, he added, is a\nbad way to legislate.\n\n   ``Some people call it the leading edge,'' Riggle said. ``Others\ncall it over the edge.''\n\n   But in most cases, there's absolutely no problem convincing\npeople to pay special attention to their pets _ excuse us, those\nother living beings in the house who have a lot of hair.\n\n   One third of ``guardians'' talk to their furry companions on the\nphone when they're away from home, according to animal hospitals\nassociation studies. Nearly two-thirds say caring for their pet\nfulfills a need for parenting. Health insurance for dogs and cats\nis a booming business.\n\n   Showering pets with all this humanity wasn't always the norm,\nexperts say. Back in the old days, back before we could talk to\nFido through the answering machine, he was around for more\npractical reasons.\n\n   ``We used to look at pets in a utilitarian view,'' said H.\nRichard Adams, dean of the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine.\n``They were used to work or protect property. Now, they're viewed\nmore as companions. That's why people value them so much.''\n\n   Adams and Woodbury said there are no definitive studies that\nsuggest today's pampered dog is a happier, more well-adjusted\ncreature.\n\n   In fact, the reality is, most dogs like to stink. Just ask local\ngroomers and dog ``guardians.'' A few minutes after Fido gets\nthrough with his bath, you can usually find him rubbing his face\nand hairy body in the yard, which, upon closer inspection, often\nincludes things we'd rather not print in a family newspaper.\n\n   ``I think a pampered dog is one that sleeps in bed with you,''\nsaid Shirlene Miller, owner of Tidy Tails Dog Grooming & Boarding.\n``That's another reason to bathe them and keep them clean. But that\ncan be hard to do. One dog (after we bathed it), ran across some\ndead frogs and rubbed against them.''\n\n   D.J. Ortman, director of the Waco Humane Society Animal Shelter,\nbelieves dogs should be treated like dogs, not humans. Even with\nthat view, she admits, some pets seem almost like children. Many\ndogs who have to go through surgery at her clinic are calm until\ntheir guardians show up and start showering them with sympathy.\n\n   ``They don't start whining until they see their owner come in,''\nOrtman said. ``They enjoy the attention.''\n\n   Miller said dogs who are groomed even seem to ``primp'' when\nthey first get home. But concluding that the clean, well-shaven dog\nreally feels like a sexier beast may not be the case, experts say.\nThe dog likely knows that he or she will be showered with affection\nand may prance around looking for the next round of petting.\n\n   Ortman has seen dogs with diamond earrings.\n\n   ``Pets do what their owners do because they want the\nattention,'' Ortman said.\n\n   That's not to say that your dog won't get into eating sirloin\nsteak every night. But Buster probably doesn't care about watching\nthe Animal Planet with you. When you talk to him and pet him while\nyou're in front of the TV, now that's what he's looking for.\n\n   ``There's taking proper care of your pet and providing for its\nwelfare,'' Adams said. ``Then there's pampering.''\n\n   Caring for your dog includes feeding it things that help teeth\nstay strong. Diamond-studded earrings are not necessary (and don't\ndo much to impress the other dogs, experts say). Showering your dog\nwith affection and spending time together on long walks is a\nhealthy routine for owner and pet. Talking to them through the\nanswering machine is optional.\n\n   Getting your pet vaccinated and having periodic checkups is\nnecessary. Letting them sleep in bed with you is not. Providing a\nhealthy diet for your pet is necessary. Feeding him table scraps is\nnot.\n\n   In fact, feeding a dog human food (or letting him have too much\nspecialty pet foods) can lead to obesity, a common problem these\ndays with dogs.\n\n   ``While I'm a firm proponent of the human/animal bond, it comes\nwith responsibility,'' Adams said. ``Owners have to look out for\nthe health and well-being of their pets and that doesn't mean\nletting the dog do whatever it wants. Most dogs would like to run\nfree through the neighborhood without a leash, but that's not safe\nfor the dog. They would like to eat a lot of the foods we eat, but\nthat's not good for them either.''\n\n   What about owners who insist their dogs stay inside where it's\nair conditioned? Aren't dogs simply domesticated descendents of\nwolves who have to deal with things like heat waves and cold\nfronts?\n\n   ``You have to look at what the dogs are bred for,'' Ortman said.\n``Some dogs would go crazy inside. They like being outside. But\npoodles are different. They've been bred to be house dogs.''\n\n   Miller said pampering doesn't just come in the home. It's on the\nroad, too. Many pet owners take their significant four-legged\nothers on cross-country vacations. While some dogs adjust well to\nbeing in a car, owners should watch to be sure the dog isn't overly\nstressed.\n\n   One thing you won't have to worry about, though, is finding a\nplace to stay.\n\n   ``There are special hotels that will accept pets,'' Miller said.\n``More and more are beginning to do it.
