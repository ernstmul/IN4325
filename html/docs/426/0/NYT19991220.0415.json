Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have concluded that an Algerian\nman arrested with bomb components as he tried to enter Washington\nstate last week from Canada represented a serious terrorist threat,\nbut are far from certain about the purpose or target of any\npossible attack.\n\n   As counterterrorism agents sifted through the background of the\nsuspect, Ahmed Ressam, examining links to known Middle Eastern\nterror groups, President Clinton's national security adviser said\nMonday that there was no specific evidence, beyond the case of\nRessam, that foreign nationals were plotting other terrorist acts\nin the United States.\n\n   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said that Americans\nshould be watchful as they prepared for New Year's activities, but\nsaid that counterterrorism officials knew of no additional domestic\nthreats. The State Department had previously cautioned Americans\ntraveling overseas to be vigilant.\n\n   Separately, customs inspectors in Vermont detained a man and\nwoman on Sunday evening trying to enter the United States from\nCanada, one of them carrying false documents, officials said. But\nlaw enforcement officials said Monday that they were uncertain of\nthe significance of the inquiry in Vermont or whether it was in any\nway related to the arrest of Ressam.\n\n   Investigators are examining whether Ressam is associated with\nany known terrorist group, like the Islamic Armed Group. Officials\nsaid they did not yet know whether he belonged to the group or had\nreceived training in improvised explosives.\n\n   Still, law enforcement officials said they had determined that\nRessam could have used the materials to construct a lethal\nexplosive device and, on that basis, decided he was a serious\npotential threat.\n\n   Ressam, who was caught by a Customs Service inspector on Dec. 14\nas he arrived on a car ferry at Port Angeles, Wash., was carrying\nin his vehicle materials that could be assembled into a crude but\npowerful bomb. The materials included more than 20 ounces of a\nnitroglycerin derivative and digital timing devices that could be\nused in a detonator.\n\n   Ressam appeared nervous when questioned by an inspector and\ntried to flee after the ferry arrived. He carried two driver's\nlicenses, one under an apparently assumed name, officials said. He\nhad a hotel reservation in Seattle for one night and a rental car\ncontract with a return date of Dec. 16, indications, the officials\nsaid, that he was planning a short stay in Seattle and might be\nacting only as an intermediary or courier in a larger plot.\n\n   But beyond the potentially suspicious evidence, little is known\nabout his intentions because Ressam, who is being held in jail, has\ndeclined to cooperate with the authorities. As a result, American\nofficials are relying on Canadian law enforcement agencies to help\nprovide insight into Ressam, who lived in Canada until last week.\n\n   Ressam was believed to have been accompanied on the ferry from\nVictoria, British Columbia, for part of the trip to the United\nStates by Karim Said Atmani, whom Canadian officials say may have\nshared an apartment with Ressam in Montreal. Atmani is believed to\nhave returned to Canada and left Ressam to complete the journey\nalone, U.S. officials said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   While Canadian authorities previously said they had extradited\nAtmani to France after he allegedly participated in several\nbombings, including one in a Paris subway in 1996, a French law\nenforcement official said Monday that Atmani had not been\nextradited to France and that there was no information linking him\nto the bombing. The French official said Canada had previously\nexpelled Atmani to Bosnia.\n\n   The French official said Ressam and Atmani were both known to\nFrench intelligence and were connected to radical groups he\ndescribed as gangster-terrorist organizations. But he said the\nFrench government had no information linking either man directly to\nthe terrorist operations of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born\nmilitant who is blamed for the bombing of two U.S. embassies in\nAfrica in August 1998.\n\n   At the State Department, a spokesman said it was premature to\ndetermine clearly whether Ressam was a member of a known extremist\ngroup.\n\n   ``Obviously, they're looking into his motivation, his\nintentions, whether he had accomplices and whether he was part of a\nwider network and is affiliated with international terrorist\ngroups,'' said the spokesman, James Foley.\n","Headline":"\nON THE TRAIL OF TERRORISM, IN WAKE OF ARREST IN WASHINGTON\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have concluded that an Algerian\nman arrested with bomb components as he tried to enter Washington\nstate last week from Canada represented a serious terrorist threat,\nbut are far from certain about the purpose or target of any\npossible attack.\n","\n   As counterterrorism agents sifted through the background of the\nsuspect, Ahmed Ressam, examining links to known Middle Eastern\nterror groups, President Clinton's national security adviser said\nMonday that there was no specific evidence, beyond the case of\nRessam, that foreign nationals were plotting other terrorist acts\nin the United States.\n","\n   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said that Americans\nshould be watchful as they prepared for New Year's activities, but\nsaid that counterterrorism officials knew of no additional domestic\nthreats.
