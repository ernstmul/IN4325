Times News Service   \n\n   RealNetworks' popular RealJukebox software for playing CDs on\ncomputers surreptitiously monitors the listening habits and certain\nother activities of people who use it and continually reports his\ninformation, along with the user's identity, to RealNetworks, said\na security expert who intercepted and examined data generated by\nthe program.\n\n   In interviews last week, company officials acknowledged that\nRealJukebox, which can copy music to a user's hard drive and\ndownload it from the Internet as well as play it, gathers\ninformation on what music users are playing and recording.\n\n   Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer\nproducts, said the company gathered the information to customize\nservices for individual users. He and other company officials\ninsisted that the practice did not violate consumer privacy because\nthe information was not being stored by RealNetworks nor\ndistributed to other companies.\n\n   But privacy advocates and security experts interviewed last week\nwere unanimous in condemning the practice, calling it a violation\nof the privacy of the 13.5 million registered users of RealJukebox,\nalmost all of whom have given the company their names and e-mail\naddresses.\n\n   Even if the company's use of the data is benign, these experts\nsaid, the practice is unacceptable because of the secrecy:\nRealNetworks, one of the largest distributors of audio software on\nthe Internet, does not inform consumers that they are being\nidentified and monitored by the company.\n\n   The information that RealNetworks gathers is extensive.\nAccording to Richard Smith, an independent Internet security\nconsultant from Brookline, Mass., who discovered RealJukebox's\nmonitoring functions, each time the program is started on a\ncomputer connected to the Internet, it sends in the following\ninformation to the company: the number of songs stored on the\nuser's hard drive; the kind of file formats _ RealAudio or MP3 _\nthe songs are stored in; the quality level of the recordings; the\nuser's preferred music genre, and the type of portable music\nplayer, if any, that the user has connected to the computer.\nOfficials at RealNetworks said most of this information was used to\noffer music selections to users based on their preferences.\n\n   All this information is combined with a personal serial number\nknown as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, which is assigned\nto each user when he or she registers the software.\n\n   RealJukebox is distributed only on the Internet, and users are\ninstructed to register _ giving the company their names, e-mail\naddresses and ZIP codes _ when they install the software.\n\n   What is more, if RealJukebox is used with its default settings,\nit automatically loads each time a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM\ndrive, and if the computer is connected to the Internet, the title\nof the CD is sent, together with the GUID, to RealNetworks.\n\n   ``Either they have been dazzlingly careless with their treatment\nof personally identifiable information or they are completely\ndisingenuous,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of\nJunkbusters, a privacy watchdog organization. ``Which is worse? If\nthey are not disclosing what they are doing, that is\nunconscionable.''\n\n   Some other CD player programs also assign GUIDs to each copy of\nthe software. The difference lies in what they do with it.\nMicrosoft Corp., for example, says that the unique identifier in\nits Windows Media Player is used for such things as purchasing\nmultimedia from a Web site. It is not routed through Microsoft, nor\ndoes Microsoft require users to register, and it does not gather\ninformation through Media Player, said a spokesman for Waggener\nEdstrom, a public relations firm that represents Microsoft.\n\n   The fact that RealJukebox is gathering this information is not\nmentioned in the long privacy policy the company posts on its Web\nsite. Nor is it acknowledged in the licensing agreement that users\nmust approve when installing the program.\n\n   nn\n\n   David Banisar, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in\nInternet law, said that RealNetworks' surveillance practices could\nviolate various state and federal statutes, including the Computer\nFraud and Abuse Act. ``It's a new type of case that hasn't been\nbrought before,'' he said. ``But I think it's a pretty good case.''\n\n   Banisar argued that RealJukebox could be considered a ``trojan\nhorse,'' a legitimate program that contains hidden instructions to\nperform illegitimate functions.\n\n   Company officials said on Friday that the registration procedure\nfor the free version of RealJukebox did ask for personal\ninformation, including name and e-mail address, but they said that\nusers could skip the registration and still use the program and\nthat RealJukebox would stop prompting users to register after five\nattempts. Some customers, they said, had stumbled on this fact and\nhad declined to register.\n\n   However, customers who purchase RealJukebox Plus, a version with\nenhanced features that RealNetworks sells online for $29.99 with a\nmoney-back guarantee, cannot avoid ring since they must type\nin a unique serial number to install the program. And in this case,\nRealNetworks also gathers credit card and mailing address\ninformation before it assigns the number.\n\n   Richards of RealNetworks said the reason the program tallied the\nnumber of songs a user had recorded was to enable the company to\ndetermine whether the user was ``naive'' or ``sophisticated.'' This\nbetter enables the software to steer sophisticated users toward its\nadvanced features, he said.\n\n   But this seemed at odds with a statement by Steve Banfield,\nRealNetworks' general manager of consumer products, who said the\ncompany was gathering only ``aggregate usage'' information about\nusers of the software.\n\n   Privacy experts said the kind of information being gathered by\nRealJukebox had the potential to be used to detect copyright\nviolations.\n\n   Banfield said that to his knowledge, the company had no plans to\nallow information about individual users to be used in this manner.\n\n   But Catlett of Junkbusters said that such information could be\nsubpoenaed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. ``This usage\nand tracking information is a way for them to collect intrusive\nprofiles about people and possibly set up prosecutions for\ncopyright infringements,'' he said.\n\n   Like some 250 other such programs, RealJukebox licenses the\nright to use a database of CD titles and tracks that is compiled\nand maintained by a company called CDDB. This enables the software\nto display the title and tracks of a CD moments after it is loaded\ninto the computer. To do this, the program must send out\ninformation to CDDB every time a user plays a CD.\n\n   But unlike other popular programs, RealJukebox routes the\ninformation through its own servers and tags it with the GUID,\nwhich uniquely identifies the user.\n\n   Banfield said the information went to CDDB via a proxy server, a\ncomputer that masks certain data, to protect the privacy of\nRealJukebox users. He said it was his understanding that CDDB\ntypically collected a user's e-mail addresses each time its\ndatabase was queried, but by using a proxy server, he said,\nRealNetworks' users were all generically identified as\nuser(AT)real.com.\n\n   Banfield painted RealNetworks as a defender of consumer privacy,\nasserting: ``Everyone else who uses that database sends them their\ne-mail address. We don't.''\n\n   Ann Greenberg, senior vice president of marketing and business\ndevelopment for CDDB, said last week that her company ``strongly\nencourages but does not require'' e-mail addresses or any other\nidentifiers that enable the company to tally unique users of its\ndatabase. She said the addresses were purged every four days. But\nshe said it was not fair for RealNetworks' to blame CDDB for\ngathering personal information.\n","Headline":"\nCD SOFTWARE SAID TO GATHER DATA ON USERS \n","Text":["\n   RealNetworks' popular RealJukebox software for playing CDs on\ncomputers surreptitiously monitors the listening habits and certain\nother activities of people who use it and continually reports his\ninformation, along with the user's identity, to RealNetworks, said\na security expert who intercepted and examined data generated by\nthe program.\n","\n   In interviews last week, company officials acknowledged that\nRealJukebox, which can copy music to a user's hard drive and\ndownload it from the Internet as well as play it, gathers\ninformation on what music users are playing and recording.\n","\n   Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer\nproducts, said the company gathered the information to customize\nservices for individual users.
