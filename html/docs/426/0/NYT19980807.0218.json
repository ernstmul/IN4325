Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ He has cured a springer spaniel of what he diagnosed\nas ``rage without reason.'' He has helped a Great Dane overcome\nsibling rivalry after the birth of its owners' first baby. At the\nmoment, he is ministering to a bulldog with a compulsive appetite\nfor its master's Gucci belts and Hermes bags.\n\n   Bashkim Dibra, a dog trainer who has such a cult following among\nManhattan pet owners that he is known simply as Bash, like a rock\nstar, charges $200 an hour to go to your apartment and bang on pots\nto quiet your barking schnauzer.\n\n   His clients have included Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker,\nRonald Perelman, Linda Wachner and Henry Kissinger. He's the ``top\ndog'' of trainers, said Georgette Mosbacher, the society figure.\n\n   Bash said: ``Everything I do, I think of the dog's point of\nview. I actually think like a dog.''\n\n   He said that it usually takes six to eight lessons for him to\n``city train'' a pet on a leash, and another seven lessons to\n``country train'' it off the leash. Given the lifestyles of many of\nhis clients, a ``town and country'' dog, as he calls it, is a must.\n\n   In April, Bash flew to Paris for an emergency visit to a Jack\nRussell terrier that had forgotten its table manners. Although the\ndog had been trained to lie quietly under outdoor restaurant tables\nalong Madison Avenue, once away from home, it lunged at other dogs.\nBash spent two days going from bistro to bistro, teaching the dog\nto nibble baguette crumbs peacefully off the cobblestones at its\nowner's feet.\n\n   ``Bash is as much a dog psychiatrist as a trainer,'' said\nVictoria Newhouse, who is married to S.I. Newhouse Jr., the owner\nof Conde Nast Publications.\n\n   ``My dog, Nero, at 12, started to withdraw,'' she said. ``Bash\ncame up with the idea of teaching him a new trick every year. It\nwould revitalize him. The challenge of learning something new made\nit not true that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.''\n\n   Bash, who is 46 and was born in Albania, has accompanied dogs to\ntheir owners' interviews with co-op boards on the Upper East Side.\nWhile the people try to prove their own good breeding, Bash shows\noff the dogs'. After one such appearance at 1185 Park Ave., he\nsaid, a board member told him, ``I wish the kids who lived here\ncould be so well mannered.''\n\n   Bash and his family came to the United States in 1963, settling\nin Riverdale in the Bronx. Bash is still based there, operating his\nprivate training service through Fieldston Pets, a grooming and\npet-supply shop owned by his sister, Mereut. He has a degree in\nanimal behavior from City University and is the author of ``Dog\nTraining by Bash'' (Dutton, 1991), now in its eighth printing, and\n``Teach Your Dog to Behave'' (Dutton, 1993).\n\n   In 1975 he was hired to train and domesticate a wolf pup for a\ntelevision movie, ``A Boy Who Cried Wolf.'' He named the pup\nMariah. ``This was my greatest teacher, the rearing and training of\nher,'' Bash said. ``The wolf is the ancestor of the dog. It's the\nprimal part of the dog that exists. It gave me insight into the\nmind of the dog.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   When he is not making house calls (all of his lessons are\nprivate), Bash is a big kahuna on the pet charity circuit. In 1992\nhe started the Dog Walk, to benefit shelter programs sponsored by\nthe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and\nin 1993 he created Paws for Cause, a dog walk for the American\nCancer Society to promote awareness that animals can also get\ncancer.\n\n   He has been on the board of the Delta Society, which brings dogs\ntogether with people who have disabilities. Earlier this year he\ncreated Canine Court in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first\ndog playground in the city. And he is creating Starpet.com, an\nonline animal talent agency for advertising and entertainment.\n\n   With an average of 50 clients a week, Bash logs 14-hour days,\nbut he doesn't mind the schedule. ``I'm a good barometer of the\neconomy,'' he said. ``There's a new wealth of people _ young Wall\nStreet people living in Scarsdale, Greenwich, Pound Ridge. It's hot\nto have a dog trainer, just like it's hot to have a personal\ntrainer.
