(js) \n By SUZANNE BOYNTON   The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa,\nCalif.)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Louie, a formerly timid miniature poodle,\nstood on his hind feet and walked backward while Benjamin Rait, 13,\nheld a cookie over his head, garnering the ``best trick'' vote from\nfellow campers.\n\n   Winston, a 90-pound black Labrador retriever, escaped from the\nafter-lunch nap area without 60-pound James Ryall, 9, but was\ncaptured by an instructor. On the second try, he sat until James\ninvited him out the door.\n\n   Sterling Weir, 9, lay across the body of his ``dead''\nmixed-breed, Kosar, and wailed. Then the pair jumped up and took\ntheir bows.\n\n   Amber, a small golden retriever, really didn't want to go\nthrough the obstacle course tunnel, but was coaxed through by Julia\nPonder, 11, and Nancy Pierson, an instructor, who stood at each end\nof the tube and used an extra treat. ``When in doubt, throw an\nextra cookie,'' quipped Nancy.\n\n   It was a typical day at Camp Best Friends, a one-week day camp\nfor kids ages 9 to 13 and their dogs, conducted for the first time\nin mid-August at Best Friends Dog Training and day care facility in\nsouthwest Santa Rosa. Best Friends is owned by Julee Fullenwider,\nwho led the camp with instructors Pierson and Pat Engle.\n\n   While the camp's first day had been fairly chaotic, said\nFullenwider, by the last day, the kids had fairly good control of\ntheir dogs. The camp's goal was to give the youngsters a format for\nthinking about and relating to their pets. Even parents who know\nhow to train dogs themselves don't always teach their children how,\nsaid Fullenwider. ``They'll say `don't do that,' but don't tell\nthem what to do.''\n\n   Take Amber and Julia, for instance. ``Amber used to not listen\nto me,'' said Julia. ``Now she listens to me a lot better.'' It\nwasn't that Amber didn't know what she was supposed to do _ she had\npreviously attended obedience classes with Julia's mother, Janet\nPonder. The camp taught Julia how to take command.\n\n   Local trainers agree it's important to involve the whole family\nin the selection, training and care of a family pet. Children are\noften expected to care for an animal, but are not taught to train.\nIn return, the dog ignores the child.\n\n   Jan Warz, who teaches dog training classes for the Humane\nSociety of Sonoma County animal shelter and Sebastopol Community\nCenter, says the point of dog training classes is training people.\nShe takes children as young as 7 in her classes.\n\n   The most common problem children have in relating to the family\ndog involves motivation, not a lack of training skills or\nresponsibility, said Warz. ``It occurs when the child is not part\nof the decision to select the animal. A lot of parents have a\npicture of the kind of dog they want to live with. They get the\ndog, supposedly for the child, and expect the child to buy into\nit.''\n\n   The notion that children are irresponsible when it comes to\ncaring for and training the family dog, said Warz, is ``just not\ntrue. There are some physical restrictions - it's terrible to have\na tiny 7-year-old come in with a huge (untrained) malamute ...\nThat's not fair for the dog, but it's really not fair for the\nchild. We try to set things up for success.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   (MORE)   \nnn\n\n   Warz said where dog training is concerned, children have the\nadvantage that ``they don't have all the baggage we adults do. If I\nsay to the class that we're going to work these dogs and then\nreward them with praise, the child knows how he feels about that.\nHe will get on the floor and roll with 'em. A child is very attuned\nto the relationship developing between them and their dog.''\n\n   Nancy Beliveau, daughter of a professional field-dog trainer,\nwas only 9 when she started training her father's clients. She\nfinds that when it comes to dog handling, ``children can do\nbasically the same as an adult.''\n\n   The only catch, said Beliveau, is that the child must have the\ndog's respect and trust in order to make it behave properly. ``Kids\nare not as assertive as they should be with the dog. He should be a\nlittle bit worried that you're the alpha dog and could correct\nhim,'' Beliveau said.\n\n   Austin Davis, 8, achieved just that at camp. Major, a German\nshepherd mix adopted in June from the Rohnert Park shelter,\nwouldn't listen to him, though Major obeyed Austin's parents. But\nafter the first day at camp, Austin said, ``He was like, oh-oh,\nhere comes Julee _ oh-oh, here comes Austin.''\n\n   Fullenwider believes this first-day phenomenon was simply due to\nthe fact that for the first time, each child-dog team had spent a\nlot of time concentrating on each other.\n\n   ``For five hours, we were consistently expecting the kids to be\nin control of the dogs. They were getting rewarded for controlling\nthe dogs. Three of us (instructors) were watching them, reminding\nthem. Our patience didn't wear down _ we knew they were going\nhome.''\n\n   Dogs that were dedicated to pulling on their leashes got prong\ncollars, which press the blunt ends of several stiff wires into the\nneck when the dog pulls. The training itself, though, was not\nintimidating for the dogs. The sternest discipline was a spritz of\ndiluted vinegar water in the face, administered by instructors\nonly, for the high crime of barking. (Don't do this at home without\nproper directions, Fullenwider warns; unless applied correctly, it\nwon't work.)\n\n   By the end of the camp, the children had learned to make their\ndogs heel, sit, lie down and stay (most of the time) and do tricks,\nmostly of the dog's choice. These behaviors were emphasized in\ngames like tic-tac-toe, wherein the child was required to make the\ndog sit or lie down and stay in order to hold the square on a board\npainted on the floor of Fullenwider's training center.\n\n   Other games emphasized just-for-fun teamwork between child and\ndog. In ``bobbing for hot dogs,'' the children directed their\ncanines' attention to a bucket of water in which hot dog pieces\nwere floating. Most dogs took little directing to find and gobble\nup the treats.\n\n   In the T-shirt relay, the child dressed the dog in a T-shirt,\nwalked a course with the dog at heel, then removed the shirt for\nthe next team member. There was an obstacle course for agility.\n\n   Campers heard speakers on veterinary care, and learned to groom\ntheir dogs and brush their teeth. There were videos, a daily craft\nperiod after lunch where campers made things like doggie treats and\nthank-you cards for the speakers, and lessons in Tellington Touch,\nan internationally practiced form of acupressure-type massage.\n\n   Of the latter, Fullenwider said, ``The founder feels that touch\nat certain places on a dog's body can help with certain ailments.\nBut where I'm coming from is, I think it's a great calming exercise\nfor the dog, and gives kids a structure rather than pulling on\ntheir ears.''\n\n   ``We want them to learn different ways of playing with the dog\nand controlling the dog.''\n\n   Parents who came to watch the video the children had made on the\nlast day of camp said the camp had succeeded in showing their\nchildren how to handle their dogs.\n\n   ``Julia had a close relationship with Amber before, but this has\nmade it even closer. I think maybe Amber has taught Julia a few\ntricks,'' said Julia's dad, Steve Ponder.\n\n   Alfie, a mixed breed, was also recently adopted from a shelter.\nAs far as training, ``He started from zero. Camp has been a really\ngood experience for my daughter,'' said Bev Zeigler, watching\nJosie, 12, catapult a tennis ball for Alfie to catch. ``During\ncamp, we tried to let her take care of him. We'll have to see now\nthat camp's over whether she'll keep it up.''\n\n   Zeigler added, ``She feels more in control. The dog's more under\ncontrol. It's definitely a good thing.''\n\n   (Suzanne Boynton writes for The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa,\nCalif.)\n","Headline":"\nAT OBEDIENCE CAMP, DOGS AND KIDS LEARN A FEW NEW TRICKS \n","Text":["\n   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Louie, a formerly timid miniature poodle,\nstood on his hind feet and walked backward while Benjamin Rait, 13,\nheld a cookie over his head, garnering the ``best trick'' vote from\nfellow campers.\n","\n   Winston, a 90-pound black Labrador retriever, escaped from the\nafter-lunch nap area without 60-pound James Ryall, 9, but was\ncaptured by an instructor.
