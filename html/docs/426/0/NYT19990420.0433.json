And it makes me think about my own children. I just can't\nimagine that happening.''\n\n   The FBI and Texas Rangers are helping about 15 sheriff's\ninvestigators assigned to the case, said Chief Deputy Richard\nElliott of the Williamson County Sheriff's Department.\n\n   Sketches of the children were released Tuesday and posted on the\nTexas Department of Public Safety's Internet web site. A bulletin\ndescribing the children was distributed to law enforcement agencies\nacross the nation.\n\n   ``They were some of the most beautiful children I've ever\nseen...and I know there is family and people out there just like\nmyself that this has got to touch their heart,'' said Ed Richards,\nWilliamson County sheriff. ``I make a heart-felt plea to anyone\nthat can come forward with information to help us find out what\nhappened to these children and help us identify them.\n\n   ``We're following a lot of leads. The whole world is a suspect\nuntil we can find out who did it. The real dilemma we have is\nmaking identification first.''\n\n   Whoever left the children in the creek is probably acquainted\nwith the area, Richards said.\n\n   ``Usually, when there are bodies in a remote area, we find they\nare familiar with the area,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean they\nlive in the area.''\n\n   The DPS Missing Persons Clearinghouse has listed 74 cases of\nmissing children fitting the children's general descriptions, said\nMix Cox, a DPS spokesman. A pair of Texas Rangers are\nsystematically going through the list in search of matches, Cox\nsaid.\n\n   Evidence of ``minor trauma'' was apparent on the children's\nbodies, Richards said. He declined to elaborate.\n\n   Investigators have virtually ruled out the possibility the dead\ngirl may be one of two girls reporting missing from the Dallas-Fort\nWorth area, Richards said.\n\n   Sheriff's department officials assigned additional deputies to\nfield phone calls about the case, but so far none of the calls has\ndeveloped into a solid lead, authorities said.\n\n   ``We've had a large number of telephone calls that have come in\nsince last night...because of the volume, we're having to get some\nhelp from other police agencies,'' Richards said.\n\n   Investigators returned to the creek bed surrounded by corn\nfields and the Hutto Cemetery to question nearby residents and\nsearch for evidence Tuesday, and plan to be back in the area today,\nRichards said.\n\n   They worked slowly through shin-high weeds, raking grass and\nwildflowers alongside FM 1660 with collapsible metal batons,\nslicing the brush for clues.\n\n   ``Anything''\n\n   Sgt. Mike Gleason was asked what the officers were trying to\nfind in the debris amid the roadside fields. ``Anything. We don't\nknow what we're looking for, but we'll know it when we find it.''\n\n   The midday sun and a steady wind trailed the six officers from\nthe sheriff's department, as did a police van stocked with water\nand Kool-Aid. The probe turned up bottles and a red plastic tray,\njunked lottery tickets, stray business cards and a $10 bill.\n\n   Potential clues began turning up more than an hour after the\nofficers started walking when one man found what appeared to be a\nwhite piece of paper. More officers were called in, the area was\nphotographed and the item was placed in a brown container and then\ncarted back to Hutto Police Department. The scene repeated several\ntimes that afternoon and K-9 units joined the search party _ hints\nof progress in an investigation that, so far, has been slow to\nyield clues.\n\n   The grim search was a reminder that times are changing in the\nHutto area, where residents gathered Tuesday to ask for news or\nwonder why two small children would be killed.\n\n   In Snuffy's restaurant on U.S. 79, a lunch-time spot where the\nmenu is printed on marker on brown paper bags, many said they\ncouldn't imagine that the children are local, because if kids were\nmissing ``we'd know about it,'' said waitress Kim Morgan, 38.\n\n   ``I'd say the whole town is pretty shocked,'' she said.\n\n   Audra Flegal, 20, a receptionist who lives near the creek, said\nthe news rattled her small-town sensibilities.\n\n   ``It hits you harder when you live in a small town and something\nlike this happens,'' she said.\n\n   In Hutto, farming and old-timers are slowly being eclipsed by\nthe growth that has consumed Williamson County. Since 1990, Hutto's\npopulation has more than doubled to about 1,300.\n\n   ``When I got here it was more of a farming community,'' Miller\nsaid. ``Now it's getting more like Round Rock.
