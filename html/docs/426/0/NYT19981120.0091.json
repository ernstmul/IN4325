Dogs, it seems,\ndon't care who pays the taxes or the bills for yard service in\ntheir neighborhoods.\n\n   From a dog's point of view, all the world's a toilet. I've\noccasionally felt the same way, especially since the\nClinton-Lewinsky scandal broke.\n\n   Let me hasten to add, however, that I don't care if the dogs use\nthis small part of my yard. They've been doing it, as it were, in\nthat spot for years.\n\n   I'm philosophical about it. Dogs have to do it somewhere. Why\nnot in the grass next to my mailbox?\n\n   I could waste time trying to identify the canine culprits and\nwaste even more time trying to change their well-established\nhabits. In the end, as it were, I could find that my efforts only\nmade matters worse. My poochie pals might designate a part of my\nyard that I actually use, like next to the barbecue grill.\n\n   Besides, I also like to think that I am doing a favor for my\nhuman neighbors who might not be so accepting of a pooch potty in\ntheir yards.\n\n   I like dogs. I've never really liked leash laws because I don't\nthink dogs like leash laws. But dogs don't get to call the shots in\nthis life.\n\n   Most communities of any size now require that all canine\nresidents be kept fenced in or on a leash.\n\n   Today's dogs are required to have proof of residency to be\nregistered and licensed, which is more proof than American humans\nneed to vote.\n\n   Most city dogs also are required to carry with them at all times\ncurrent proof of residency and registration. They don't seem to\nmind.\n\n   Even worse, from a dog's point of view, are laws that encourage\nthe use of knives on their private parts to prevent them from\nexperiencing the joys of parenthood.\n\n   When I was growing up, dogs were free to live the good life,\nwhich is a dog's life. They were free to roam wherever they wanted,\nsleep wherever they wanted, follow you to school and romp and play\nwith their friends.\n\n   Free roaming dogs of yesteryear enjoyed checking their mail and\nleaving their personalized messages on established doggie bulletin\nboards, which to us appeared to be trees, telephone poles and fire\nhydrants.\n\n   My guess is that the first doggie leash law was in New York\nCity. Lots of things get started in New York City and then spread\nlike a bad cold to the rest of the country.\n\n   I'm sure that the first pooper scooper law I ever heard about\ncame from New York City.\n\n   Only in New York City, I remember thinking, would people come up\nwith the idea of following their dogs around until they pooped and\nthen by force of law requiring them to pick up and carry away the\nfresh droppings. This seemed to me a more compelling reason to rise\nup and overthrow the government than taxes on Boston tea.\n\n   But I didn't live in New York City. I had no way of knowing how\ndisgusting and frustrating dog doo can be on sidewalks in a crowded\ncity until I visited Paris recently.\n\n   Parisians also love dogs. In Paris, dogs accompany their masters\neverywhere. Dogs are allowed in hotels, bars, brasseries,\nrestaurants, bakeries and stores.\n\n   Parisian dog owners watch as their dogs do their business right\nin the middle of a narrow sidewalk. They then casually stroll off\nwith relieved Fifi in tow.\n\n   A Nov. 15 Washington Post news story reported that Paris\nofficials have launched an experimental program to build dog toilet\nenclosures in one section of Paris.\n\n   I think the Parisians will like it. It works for me. Every time\nI pick up my mail, I remember Paris.\n\n   Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco (Texas)\nTribune-Herald.
