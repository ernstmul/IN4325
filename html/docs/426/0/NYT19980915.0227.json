(bl)  \n By RICK BRAGG   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   NEW ORLEANS _ The Russians did not ask for a Blue Dog when\nGeorge Rodrigue visited the Soviet Union with President Ronald\nReagan a decade or so ago, but they thought a horse would be nice.\n\n   ``I painted Reagan on a white horse,'' said Rodrigue, the artist\nfrom Cajun Louisiana who, before becoming so famous for his spooky,\ncomical and wildly prosperous renderings of cobalt-colored dogs,\npainted other things, like heads of state. ``I painted Gorbachev on\nthe ground, holding out his hand in friendship.''\n\n   Soviet officials, including those who Rodrigue swears were from\nthe KGB, were unhappy with that.\n\n   ``They said it looked like Gorbachev was begging,'' he said.\n\n   The Russians wanted Mikhail Gorbachev painted on a horse, too.\n\n   ``I didn't know he had a horse,'' Rodrigue told them.\n\n   ``He doesn't,'' one Soviet official answered.\n\n   People can say what they like about Blue Dogs, Rodrigue's\npaintings of what seems to be the same dog stuck almost like a\npostage stamp on various landscapes, portraits and situations _\nworks that some critics, with sneers intact, dismiss as fad or not\nreally art at all.\n\n   What began as a man's painting of his long-dead dog _ actually,\nthree different dead dogs lent inspiration for Blue Dog _ has\nbecome a lasting sensation, with more than 1,200 Blue Dog paintings\nsince 1984. They hang everywhere from the White House to Whoopi\nGoldberg's house, in Tom Brokaw's house and in the houses of no one\nin particular. A Blue Dog hangs on the set of ``Friends'' and\nstares from Neiman Marcus and Absolut vodka ads. You can't swing a\ndead cat without hitting a Blue Dog.\n\n   Famous people buy them and rich people buy them and even a few\ndrunk conventioneers buy them when they stagger into Rodrigue's\ngallery in the French Quarter and are captivated by the little blue\ndog with the round yellow eyes, but no one buys them cheaply. They\ncan range from a few thousand dollars to $250,000.\n\n   The artist has earned millions and created a cultural icon. And\nyear after year, those who do not see what the big deal is about\nask the same thing: Why?\n\n   Even Rodrigue, whose sometimes dark and eerie landscapes of his\nnative state made him a respected artist decades before Blue Dog,\nis a little surprised.\n\n   Before his Blue Dogs, he was acclaimed by Le Figaro as the\n``Louisiana Rousseau.'' Italy awarded him its Gold Medal for the\narts, and he was honored by the Salon des Artistes of Paris.\n\n   ``I'm surprised by people's reactions,'' he said. It is not\nunusual, he said, to have people stare at the Blue Dog paintings\nand cry. ``The yellow eyes are really the soul of the dog,'' he\nsaid. ``He has this piercing stare. People say the dog keeps\ntalking to them with the eyes, always saying something different.''\n\n   The critics' claims that Rodrigue has hit on a modern-day\nversion of soup-can art just slide off him. If it is fashion, it is\nfashion that has lasted almost 15 years.\n\n   ``People who have seen a Blue Dog painting always remember it,''\nhe said. ``They are really about life, about mankind searching for\nanswers. The dog never changes position. He just stares at you. And\nyou're looking at him, looking for some answers, `Why are we here?'\nand he's just looking back at you, wondering the same. The dog\ndoesn't know. You can see this longing in his eyes, this longing\nfor love, answers.''\n\n   ``It's not just a dog,'' he added, but a dog trapped in that\nsame uncertainty all people feel. And no matter how many landscapes\nthe dog travels to, its expression never changes.\n\n   Perhaps one of the most famous Blue Dogs is one commissioned by\nPresident Clinton for his inauguration, showing him and Vice\nPresident Al Gore striding confidently into the future.\n\n   Blue Dog's creator comes from a people shackled by water. Drive\nalong the long, flat ribbons of asphalt through Cajun Louisiana,\nand it often seems as if there is no dry land at all, just thin\nstretches of road between black trees and swamps.\n\n   ``The trees are always very dark,'' he said of his early\npaintings, ``but the people are in white,'' almost glimmering in\ncontrast to their surroundings, their feet barely touching the\nground. They seem ghostlike, their eyes staring straight ahead,\nsearching the face of the person who is searching their own faces\nfrom the other side of the canvas. They seem to hang suspended in a\nlandscape, but the spirit inside them shines through, like a\nlighted window from a cabin surrounded by swamp.\n\n   Rodrigue, the son of a bricklayer, was born in 1944 in New\nIberia, La. ``When I was in the third grade I got polio and had to\nstay in bed a year and half,'' he said. ``That's when my mother\ngave me some crayons and some clay.''\n\n   When he was 18, he went off to study at the Art Center College\nof Design in Pasadena, Calif., and came home to find the bayou\nchanged.\n\n   ``The culture was eroding and disappearing,'' he said. ``I\nwanted to preserve that heritage, and I started painting the people\nI knew.''\n\n   He made a good living painting the dark trees, doing portraits,\nsome from old photos, of Louisiana legends like Huey Long and his\nbrother, Earl. He did coffee table books and collaborated on an\nacclaimed book of poetry. Often at his side as he painted was his\ndog Tiffany, who lived from 1968 to 1980, just a little dog with\npointy ears.\n\n   In 1984, he was asked to paint, for a collection of Cajun ghost\nstories, a picture of a monster from his childhood, the ghost dog,\nor werewolf, which appears blue in the moonlight. Here, people\ncalled it the loup-garou.\n\n   Even though Tiffany had not been very fierce, Rodrigue used the\nlittle dog as his model. He painted her blue, gave her red eyes and\npositioned her on a grave. The image haunted him, trapped in the\ncanvas, searching. He could never get the dog out of his head.\n\n   nn\n\n   In 1989, he hung a Blue Dog painting with his other works at his\nNew Orleans gallery. People seemed to like it. The image of the dog\nchanged with time as memories of other dogs crept into his\npaintings _ changed in its shade of blue (except when it is\npossessed by spirits, and then it is red) and even a little in\nshape.\n\n   But it remained, well, a Blue Dog _ a Blue Dog with a naked\nwoman, a Blue Dog in a cowboy hat, a Blue Dog in a suit and tie, a\nBlue Dog over the Manhattan skyline, a Blue Dog with . . . you name\nit, you got it.\n\n   Rodrigue paints in solitude at his cabin in the Atchafalaya\nbasin and always has to watch for floods. ``But I work from a\nraised cottage.
