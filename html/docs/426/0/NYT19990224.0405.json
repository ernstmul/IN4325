Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Three dogs without leashes took off in joyous pursuit\nof a 47-year-old architect last week while all four were out for a\nmorning's run in Manhattan's Riverside Park.\n\n   One dog bit the architect's ankle. Another urinated on a\nshoulder bag he had dropped. The architect complained furiously to\ncity, state and federal officials about a ``tyranny of the\nminority.'' But he did not want his name published, saying that he\nfeared a backlash from militant dog owners in his Upper West Side\napartment building.\n\n   Dog wars: a chronic conflict made worse by New Yorkers who are\nowning bigger, stronger, more robust dogs. As never before, tens of\nthousands of big dogs who loathe the leash are lunging out of\napartments to do what dogs must do in city parks that are better\nmaintained, safer and more crowded than they have been in decades.\n\n   There's the rub.\n\n   So to preserve Central Park and especially Riverside Park, which\nthe city regards as ground zero in the dog wars, Parks Commissioner\nHenry J. Stern announced stiffer fines, increased enforcement and a\npublic-relations campaign Wednesday that attempts to equate dog\nowners who violate leash laws with smokers.\n\n   By getting tough on free-range dogs _ an echo of Mayor Rudolph\nGiuliani's quality-of-life crackdown on everything from squeegee\nmen to jaywalking to chewing-gum spitters _ the city hopes to\npersuade dog owners that it is unhealthful, inconsiderate and even\nshameful to let dogs run free.\n\n   ``You might call them dog terrorists,'' Stern said. ``They let\nthem off leash at all times, frighten other people, especially\nchildren, and trample the public lawns.'' He added, though, that\nthese ``arrogant and abusive'' New Yorkers are a relatively small\npercentage of dog owners.\n\n   To protect the gussied-up parks and the people who use them,\nStern said he is proposing a doubling in fines for repeat violators\nof leash and pooper-scooper laws. The $100 fine will double, he\nsaid, for second-time offenders and double again and again for\nsubsequent violations to a limit of $1,000.\n\n   Stern also said the Parks Department would invite more police\ninto the parks, build a data base of habitual dog-law violators and\noutfit civilians with radios and cell phones so they can report dog\nowners who violate canine-control laws.\n\n   Riverside Park dog owners have reacted angrily to efforts to\nrestrict dogs. When fences were put up to block dog access to a\npopular play field for off-leash dogs, owners put up signs that\ncalled the enclosure ``Treblinka.''\n\n   The leader of the largest dog-owner group in Riverside Park\nresponded Wednesday to the proposed crackdown with a plea for space\nfor dogs to run free of leashes and a veiled threat of civil\ndisobedience if such space is not forthcoming.\n\n   ``If there is not sufficient space for people to play with one's\ndog off leash, then people either will feel persecuted or forced\ninto what the commissioner considers antisocial behavior,'' said\nDr. Jeffrey Zahn, an anesthesiologist who is president of the dog\ngroup, FLORAL.\n\n   Stern would tend to agree.\n\n   ``You see in Riverside Park there is a fringe of very intense\ndog owners,'' he said. ``These owners when ticketed give names such\nas Eva Braun. They cast themselves as victims of authority. They\nhope a gullible press will see their victimhood. In fact, it is\nmothers and children who use the parks who are the victims.''\n\n   Stern stressed in the interview that he is not anti-dog and that\nhe owns and loves a golden retriever named Boomer, who the\ncommissioner's aides insist is never allowed off his leash. ``I\nreally believe that owning and relating to an animal is a\nlife-enriching experience,'' Stern said.\n\n   As a matter of law, dogs have no right to run free anywhere in\nNew York. They lost that right 123 years ago when Frederick Law\nOlmsted, who designed Central and Riverside parks, personally wrote\na set of rules that tethered them to a leash not more than 6 feet\nlong.\n\n   Yet in the 1970s and early 1980s, when many parks were\nill-maintained and relatively empty because of crime, the Parks\nDepartment did not much care if dogs ranged off leash. In those\nyears, park managers saw dogs and their owners as a civilizing\ninfluence. Better the depredation of dogs, they reasoned, than the\nmarauding of muggers and drug dealers.\n\n   It was in those dark days that dogs and owners wrested an\ninformal but crucial concession from the parks department. Dogs\nhave since been allowed off-leash in parks between 9 p.m. and 9\na.m. At the time, it hardly mattered. There wasn't much carefully\ntended greenery for dogs to destroy.\n\n   But in the last decade, at a cost of many millions of dollars,\ndesolate, no-go landscapes in city parks have been restored. Crime\nhas fallen as steeply in parks as in the rest of the city. And the\ndog presence that once helped stabilize the parks has become, in\nthe view of Adrian Benepe, commissioner of parks in Manhattan,\n``our biggest problem.'' The Parks Department estimated Wednesday\nthat it spends $250,000 a year in Central and Riverside parks to\nrepair damage done by dogs.\n\n   The informal off-leash concession, though, has evolved into what\nmany dog owners see as a God-given right. Some Parks administrators\nsay that by giving dog owners the off-leash night, they have\ninadvertently encouraged them to seize the off-leash day.\n\n   ``The relaxing of the rules doesn't win us any cooperation,''\nsaid Charles E. McKinney, administrator of Riverside Park. ``In\nfact, it has encouraged more people to have dogs off leash during\nthe day.''\n\n   Stern, for the moment at least, is unwilling to challenge the\ninformal agreement that lets dogs run free at night and in the\nearly morning.\n\n   ``We are talking about things that happen during the day,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Park managers are convinced that the problem of dogs being off\nleash, both in the permitted night and the illicit day, is\ncompounded by the size of the offending dogs. ``One now sees in\nCentral Park and Riverside Park a larger dog than one typically saw\nin a New York City setting,'' Benepe said. ``A big dog running\ncircles on a dormant park lawn can do a lot of damage. They kick up\ndivots like a golf club.''\n\n   Many dog owners regard such statements as ill-informed, unfair\nand profoundly offensive. While they acknowledge that dogs can\ndamage park land, owners contend that ball players, frolicking\nchildren and homeless people are also to blame. They say that the\nbest way for park officials to limit dog damage is to work in good\nfaith with responsible owners _ and refrain from saying hurtful\nthings about dogs.\n\n   When pressed, many dog owners say that their dogs _ particularly\ntheir big dogs _ have an inalienable right to run off-leash. When\nparks do not honor that right, they say, there is bound to be\nblatant disregard for leash laws.\n\n   ``Should we be deprived of all nature?'' said Madeleine Dale, a\nfounder of FLORAL, who runs in Riverside Park with her 85-pound\nScottish deerhound _ off leash, of course. ``Should we be deprived\nof all courtesy?
