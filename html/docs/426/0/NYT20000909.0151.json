Times News Service  \n  I moved to Brooklyn 15 years ago and have since spent several\nmornings each week walking, running or just greeting the day in\nProspect Park. In recent years, these tranquil mornings have been\ntoo often disrupted by snarling dogs who are permitted off their\nleashes in the early morning during what the park system refers to\nas ``courtesy hours.'' In the last year alone, I have been cornered\nfour times by ill-behaved dogs _ two of them pit bulls _ who were\nclearly unfit to run loose in a public park.\n\n   The owners of such dogs rarely apologize and sometimes behave as\nbelligerently as their animals. The owner of a big, menacing boxer\npromised to kill me when I told him I would mace the dog if it\ncharged me again. A few weeks later, the owner of a frothing German\nshepherd declined to leash his dog _ essentially using it to corner\nme, while he advised me to stay home during ``courtesy hours'' and\nlectured me on the dog's right to be free.\n\n   Dog groups in Brooklyn and elsewhere are fighting to head off\nnew dog regulations and to preserve the privileges they now enjoy\nin the public parks. But those privileges will remain at risk\nunless the owners can learn to balance the needs of their animals\nwith the needs of the human beings with whom they share New York\nCity's public spaces.\n\n   Animal welfare officials estimate that there are a million dogs\nin the city _ or roughly one canine for every eight human beings.\nThe number of dogs will continue to grow, thanks to new federal\nregulations that allow the 430,000 people who live in New York City\npublic housing to own dogs. In 1998, the chairman of the New York\nCity Housing Authority tried to block the measure, arguing that\npublic housing's dog problem was already out of control, even with\nrules that limited dog ownership to the elderly and the disabled.\n\n   Over the last 10 years, the number of dog bites reported to the\nCity Health Department has ranged from 6,000 to nearly 11,000 a\nyear. The number of biting dogs taken into custody by animal care\nofficials grew by nearly a third between 1996 and 1999, as more and\nmore New Yorkers who were ill prepared to train and handle such\ndogs acquired them anyway. Testifying before the City Council last\nyear, the city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, concluded\nthat New York had ``failed to adequately protect the public from\nbiting dogs.'' Cohen supported a Giuliani administration bill that\nwould have required liability insurance for pit bulls _ which are\nresponsible for about a third of all bites in the city _ and made\nit easier for the city to confiscate vicious and biting dogs\ngenerally. Dog groups have blocked the bill.\n\n   The practice of allowing dogs to run free in city parks during\nthe early morning and late evening evolved informally during the\n1970s and 80s, when the parks were suffering from neglect and dog\nowners felt safer than other people about entering the overgrown,\ncrime-ridden spaces. The ``courtesy hours'' continued after the\nparks were cleaned up and patrons returned. But the last few years\nhave seen considerable friction between dog owners and park\nvisitors who want to picnic, sunbathe or exercise without being set\nupon by wayward animals.\n\n   With too few park officers to cover all the boroughs, city park\nauthorities rely on loosely organized groups of dog owners who use\npeer pressure to bring owners into line. Conscientious dog owners\nroutinely chase down others who break park rules and fail to clean\nup after their dogs. But, fearing that poorly behaved dogs will be\neuthanized, dog owners sometimes suppress news of even serious\nmaulings that should be reported to the police.\n\n   In September 1999, a Brooklyn woman named Sarah Lowe was badly\nbitten by a dog that was part pit bull and roaming off its leash in\nProspect Park. The dog clamped down so fiercely that it fractured\nLowe's wrist. After six months of physical therapy, Lowe may yet\nrequire surgery to correct the damage.\n\n   A dog that breaks the bones of an adult could kill a small\nchild. But instead of filing a police complaint right away, Lowe\nsays she negotiated with the dog's owner, who agreed to muzzle the\ndog. Lowe waited two months before she reported the attack to the\npolice _ and said she did so only after finding that the dog had\nbitten someone else and was still roaming the park unmuzzled.\n\n   The dog that bit Lowe is listed in the police report as a pit\nbull mix named Ozzie. But as recently as two weeks ago, I\nencountered this dog bounding through the park playing fetch, as\nwary walkers moved aside. A man walking his own dog warned: ``Keep\nout of his way. That is one dangerous animal.''\n\n   The police and the health department hold the ultimate\nresponsibility for controlling dogs proved to be vicious. But if\nowners wish to keep their privileges in the parks, they will need\nto show as much concern for public comfort and safety as for the\nrights of their animals.   \n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN DOGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN PEOPLE \n","Text":["\n   The owners of such dogs rarely apologize and sometimes behave as\nbelligerently as their animals.
