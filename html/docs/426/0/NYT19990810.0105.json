(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By SCOTT ALLEN  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of\nthe nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly\nretreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams,\nswamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the\nCorps' records indicates.\n\n   The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with\nprotecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible\nviolations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2\npercent of permit applications for major wetland projects. In 1992,\nthe Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according\nto the documents.\n\n   Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters\ngoal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they\nfeel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one\nfield office, they received a memo urging them to avoid\ntime-consuming, costly enforcement actions.\n\n   Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps\noffices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7\nmillion since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55. During\nthat period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as\nthe region's economy prospered.\n\n   Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and\nenforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects\na society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so\nthere are fewer attempts to damage them.\n\n   In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget\nfreezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to\n1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor\nissues and allowing state regulators to do more.\n\n   ``We believe we've substantially increased environmental\nprotection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the\nheadquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Employees critical\n\n     \n  \n\n   But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to\nenforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has\nbecome a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.\n\n   ``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said\nMagi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility,\nwho quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve\ndevelopments she felt should have been turned down. ``A program\nwithout enforcement is an invitation to break the law without\nconsequences.''\n\n   The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group\nfor government employees concerned about environmental issues,\nprovided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other\ndocuments obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the\nFreedom of Information Act after employees complained of a\nprecipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps.\n\n   Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife\nFederation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom\nfor thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do\nnot have strong enforcement programs. He said New England states\ngenerally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough\nCorps can help stand up to powerful industries.\n\n   ``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't\norganize it the way it is. But given where we are, we would be in\nreal bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie\nsaid.\n\n   The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government\ntries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are\nnursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals. Americans\ndestroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that\nthese swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing\nfloodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap\nwater.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Clinton steps in\n\n     \n  \n\n   The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of\nwetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating\n100,000 acres more than are destroyed. The main tool would be the\nrestoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the\nFlorida Everglades.\n\n   The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two\nagencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of\nEngineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together\nshare responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that\ngoverns wetland development.\n\n   The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland\nenforcement division, including one full-time employee based in\nBoston. At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million\nmore for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by\nCongress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the\nCorps is often an obstacle to development.\n\n   However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton\ndoes not plan to beef up enforcement significantly. Almost half of\nthe extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses\nand individuals to challenge Corps decisions.\n\n   Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less\ncomfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA. The Corps, best\nknown as the builder of public works and flood control projects,\nobjected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in\n1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because\nof a violation.\n\n   Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also\ncut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public\nEmployees for Environmental Responsibility review. Orders to\nrestore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109\nsince 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to\n5,141 in the same period.\n\n   ``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps\nemployee said. ``What's the use of getting a permit if people can\ndo it without a permit?''\n\n   A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the\nwhistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases\nto avoid. According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do\nnothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a\nreported violation is substantial. Even with some major violations,\nthe memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case''\nif another agency will not take over.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Work overload\n\n     \n  \n\n   New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the\noffice has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun\ntransferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is\noverwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by\none full-time and one part-time staff member.\n\n   But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes\nsense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger\nlegal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle\nprosecution of flagrant cases.\n\n   More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement\noverlooks big improvements at the Corps. For instance, he said the\nCorps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland\ndamage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit,\nthree times smaller than the previous minimum size.\n\n   He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement\nthat developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.\nLast year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is\nmore than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.\n\n   ``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005. Our part of\nthat is that we believe we should continue to administer the\nprogram so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.\n\n   However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands\ncreated by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows\nhalf of them fail. Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage\nStudet cites does not include illegal activity.\n\n     \n  \n\n   Criticism of Corps\n\n     \n  \n\n   Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility\nsaid the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of\ncontroversy it bends over backward for powerful industries. Even in\nthe Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is\nmore vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to\npolitical pressure.\n\n   Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one\nCorps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the\nrapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has\nlobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for\nthe crop. The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly\ngranted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to\noffset the damage.\n\n   New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each\nproject received proper review before it was approved, saying\ncritics ``are rushing to judgment. We certainly were knowledgeable\nthat the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean\nwe are going to roll over. We are very careful not to give special\ntreatment.''\n\n   In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up\nwetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate\n12 positions during the last four years. ``We're doing more with\nless,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nARMY RETREATS ON WETLANDS PROTECTION, REPORT SAYS \n","Text":["\n   Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of\nthe nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly\nretreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams,\nswamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the\nCorps' records indicates.\n","\n   The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with\nprotecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible\nviolations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2\npercent of permit applications for major wetland projects.
