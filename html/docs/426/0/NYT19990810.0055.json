Or at least they restrained the frequently\nrambunctious Bud and Charlie, a mutually devoted pair of mostly Lab\ncompanions, during testing of a 9-5 wagon. Bud, the older, seemed\nhappily restrained in the cargo area, while Charles, a hyper\nclass-clown type, actually remained sedately tethered to a\nrear-seat safety belt. Neither was slipping and sliding the way\ndogs frequently do during starts, turns and stops.\n\n   As for the wagon itself, a nimble 3,700-pounder that can handle\nfive humans and 37 cubic feet of cargo in the rear, it's a very\nnonwagon sort of vehicle to drive. Between its turbocharged\n170-horsepower engine and sporting suspension, it accelerates\nquickly, is responsive at speed and rides quite nicely.\n\n   With the only options _ excluding the doggie equipment _ being\nthe four-speed automatic transmission and several seat choices, the\n9-5 wagon's standard equipment seems to justify the base price of\n$31,850 (it totaled $36,170, plus about $250 for dog accessories).\n\n   Saab, which seems to stage a test crash every other business day\nin the interest of safety, could hardly have picked a more\nopportune time to introduce the dog safety items. Author Stephen\nKing's injuries, suffered earlier this year when an unruly\nRottweiler caused its owner/driver to swerve and strike the\nstrolling King, set off a flurry of interest in protecting pets and\npedestrians, too.\n\n   Saab's catalog, which offers clothing and sports gear as well as\nauto accessories, devotes four pages to the dogs. For safety,\nthere's a $24.95 harness, a $19.95 belt for seat-riding dogs, a\n$49.95 leash that restrains dogs in the rear, and a $69.95 carrier\nfor smaller dogs and cats that will also fit under airplane seats.\n\n   That, as usual, is not the only mention of aircraft in analyzing\nSaab vehicles. Its early involvement with aviation helps account\nfor the true cockpit styling of the 9-3 and 9-5 vehicles. The\ndual-cockpit front gives a secure feeling, while the instruments\nand controls are readily available.\n\n   Saab contends that its console-mounted ignition switch makes\nsense because operating it leaves the driver's hand close to the\nshift selector. Logical, yes, but that doesn't mean it's easy to\nreprogram drivers used to traditionally located ignitions.\n\n   Get behind the wheel, and Saab's thoughtfulness is readily\napparent in, among other things, convenient drink holders, a\nwide-angle mirror on the passenger side, a clip on the lower left\nwindshield to hold parking permits or other documents, and an\noptional sliding rear floor that facilitates tailgating.\n\n   Bottom-liners will find it difficult to fault Saab for the\ninterior, despite the forever-quirky exterior styling. But how can\nanyone possibly fault an automaker that wants to make a dog's life\neven better and safer?\n\n   Test vehicle: 1999 Saab 9-5 front-wheel-drive wagon\n\n   Price as tested: $36,170 (base: $31,850)\n\n   Drivetrain: 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine (170\nhorsepower), optional four-speed automatic transmission with\nnormal, sport and winter modes\n\n   Safety features: dual-front air bags, driver and front passenger\nside/head air bags, spring-loaded anti-whiplash front seats, power\nanti-lock disc brakes, three-point belts at all seats,\nsemiautomatic height adjustment for outboard seats, wide-angle\npassenger side mirror, daytime running lights\n\n   Other options on test vehicle: leather interior, $1,350; heated\nand fan-ventilated front seats and heated rear seats, $520;\nintegrated child booster seat, $300;dealer-installed sliding load\nfloor, $425\n\n   EPA figures: 19 mpg city; 26 mpg highway\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Not even Saabophiles, loyalist lot that they are, can\nresist the temptation to pun when talking about the Swedish\nautomaker's latest step in auto safety: They're dogging it.\n","\n   That's right _ safety belts, restraints and other accessories\ndesigned to provide safer and more comfortable travel for dogs and\ntheir masters who own the '99 Saab 9-5 front-wheel-drive wagon.\n","\n   They work, too.
