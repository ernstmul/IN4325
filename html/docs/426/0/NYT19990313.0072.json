Times News Service   \n\n   LINCOLN, Mont. _ Theodore Kaczynski won notoriety as the\nUnabomber, the evil genius who mailed deadly pipe bombs to\nscientists and corporate targets from California to New Jersey.\n\n   But in this mountain village nestled in pine forests below the\nContinental Divide, new detective work is giving Kaczynski a new\nnotoriety: as a pioneer for environmental sabotage. Starting in\n1975, a decade before Earth First made ``monkey-wrenching'' a\nhousehold term, Kaczynksi opened a local front in his one-man war\nagainst what he called the octopus of technology.\n\n   Roaming on foot and on bicycle in a 25-mile radius from his\ncabin here, Lincoln's environmental radical, according to several\nsources, booby-trapped motorcycle trails with wires strung between\ntrees, sabotaged mining machinery with sand, burned logging\nequipment, poured sugar into snowmobile gas tanks and destroyed\nhunting and mining camps and vacation cabins with ax blows.\n\n   The account of this 20-year trail of sabotage comes from two\nletters Kaczynski wrote from prison in January, an investigation by\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and a new book by a longtime\nneighbor who read part of the hermit's diaries.\n\n   In one of the recent letters from prison, where he is serving a\nlife sentence for bombings that killed three people and wounded 22,\nKaczynski took credit for ``monkeywrenching'' and for shooting a\ndog to death, writing, ``Shoot, shovel, and shut up.'' The\nneighbor, Chris Waits, said Kaczynski killed nine of his dogs over\na decade, largely by poisoning with strychnine oats. Waits said he\nhad heard Kaczynski cursing the dogs, whose barking may have\nbetrayed his whereabouts in the woods.\n\n   Starting in the summer of 1975 and ending with his arrest here\nin April 1996, the vandalism campaign caused hundreds of thousands\nof dollars in property damage, but apparently no human injuries.\nKaczynski avoided suspicion by varying his targets and locations,\nby shunning confrontations with people and by suspending attacks in\nthe winter, when snow would capture footprints.\n\n   The vandalism prompted the only known law-enforcement contact\nwith Kaczynski before his arrest for the Unabom crimes. In the fall\nof 1982, according to a diary entry in Waits' book, Kaczynksi\nchopped his way into a vacation home nearly a mile from his cabin,\n``smashed up the interior pretty thoroughly,'' and ``thoroughly\nsmashed'' a motorcycle and four snowmobiles.\n\n   One week later, two deputy sheriffs investigating the incident\nknocked on his cabin door and stood face to face with a man who was\nwanted nationwide for seven bomb attacks. So far the bombings had\nwounded but not killed people.\n\n   ``I was so cool and collected in answering cops questions,''\nKaczynski boasted in a numerical code entry decoded 14 years later\nby the FBI. Noting that the police never returned _ and that his\nterrorized neighbors did not resume snowmobiling that winter _ he\nwrote: ``Who says crime doesn't pay? I feel very good about this.''\n\n   In Lincoln, the vandalism was not seen as a one-man crime wave,\nin part because of a lack of communication between summer people\nand year-round residents, and in part because of turnover of local\nlaw-enforcement personnel, said Waits, one of a handful of current\nresidents who were here in 1971, when Kaczynski and his brother,\nDavid, bought a 1.4-acre lot east of town.\n\n   ``When a lot of these things happened, we thought it was kids\nout on a weekend rampage,'' said Waits, who wrote his book,\n``Unabomber: The Secret Life of Ted Kaczynski,'' with Dave Shors,\nan editor at The Independent Record of Helena.\n\n   ``I did do some monkeywrenching in the Lincoln area,'' Kaczynski\nwrote the Helena newspaper in January. ``I did, for example,\nattempt to injure trailbikers by setting traps for those who took\ntheir motorcycles off the road and back into the hills.''\n\n   The book describes about 25 incidents of vandalism. Waits, who\nworked closely with FBI investigators here and said he read ``at\nleast 1,000 pages'' of the journals, calculates that there were\nmore than 50 attacks.\n\n   In Lincoln, Kaczynski concentrated his attacks on loggers,\nminers and recreationists who used motorized vehicles. To him,\nmotorcycles, snowmobiles and ``evil jet planes'' were tips of a\ntechnological ``octopus'' reaching into the wilderness.\n\n   ``I cut the fan-belt, cut some tubes, put dirt in the place\nwhere oil goes in,'' Kaczynski wrote in his journal on Oct. 23,\n1979, after attacking a mining camp. ``There was a nice new pickup\ndown by the road, I think belonging to some of these mining fools,\nand I smashed the windshield and cut some belts and tubes on it.''\n\n   Although Kaczynski called himself ``a primitive\nhunter-gatherer'' and fed himself by poaching, he despised other\nhunters. In his diaries, he wrote of attacking empty hunting camps\nor cabins.
