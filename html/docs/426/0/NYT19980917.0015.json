Times News Service    \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:\n\n   The House is poised to consider a misguided bill against\nassisted suicide that would intrude on the right of doctors to\nprovide appropriate care at the end of a patient's life and the\nright of states to regulate the practice of medicine.\n\n   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., would allow the\nfederal Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate and punish\nany physician who prescribes lethal doses of drugs with the intent\nof assisting in a patient's suicide. Even the American Medical\nAssociation, which opposes physician-assisted suicide, is strongly\nopposed to this bill.\n\n   The legislation is an inappropriate attempt to undo the Oregon\nDeath With Dignity Act, which citizens in that state approved by a\n60 percent vote last November. The Oregon law allows a terminally\nill patient who is of sound mind to obtain a prescription for\nlethal drugs if two doctors judge that the patient has less than\nsix months to live.\n\n   Last November, DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine announced\nthat the agency had authority to revoke a doctor's drug license for\nprescribing lethal doses even if the doctor fully complied with\nOregon's law. Attorney General Janet Reno sensibly reversed that\npolicy in June, ruling that federal drug laws did not give the DEA\npower to ban all physician-assisted suicide in this country.\n\n   The Supreme Court has said that states should be free to engage\nin the profound debate over the right to die. Oregonians have\ndecided that their legislation reflects their needs and values,\nwhile other states have chosen different approaches. But\ncongressional opponents of the Oregon law want to deny all states\nthe right to make any judgments on this issue.\n\n   This kind of heavy-handed legislation is likely to harm patients\nand could even cause more suicides. Doctors facing the possibility\nof a federal investigation would be less likely to provide\naggressive but potentially lethal drug therapy for pain relief. It\nis the lack of adequate pain management that drives some patients\nto seek suicide in the first place. The bill, by giving federal\nbureaucrats new power to second-guess difficult medical decisions,\nwould increase needless suffering among terminal patients.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: OVERREACHING ON ASSISTED SUICIDE \n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 17:\n","\n   The House is poised to consider a misguided bill against\nassisted suicide that would intrude on the right of doctors to\nprovide appropriate care at the end of a patient's life and the\nright of states to regulate the practice of medicine.\n","\n   The bill, sponsored by Rep.
