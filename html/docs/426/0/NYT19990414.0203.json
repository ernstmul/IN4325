ANDERSON  \n c. 1999 Columbia News Service  \n\n   NEW YORK _ The door has barely swung shut, when the muscular,\nreddish dog jumps down from its perch by the window and flings\nitself at the intruder. Forty pounds of writhing, panting pit bull\nscrabble across a cement floor on Manhattan's Lower East Side.\n\n   ``Stop it!'' Glen Hettrick, the beast's owner, yells from the\nback of the bar, but the dog ignores him.\n\n   Hettrick shrugs and returns to his pool game. The pit bull,\nnamed Ginger, tail wagging, jumps up again and again, trying to\nlick the stranger's face.\n\n   ``She'll go home with you after a few drinks,'' said Hettrick's\nwife, Rosemarie.\n\n   Hardly the snarling, spike-collared beast with steel-trap jaws\nthat the name pit bull calls up. To many dog owners, pit bulls are\nbeloved family pets, guilty, if anything, of an insatiable craving\nfor affection and an over-eagerness to please.\n\n   But many municipalities across the country are acting on the\ndogs' reputation, singling out pit bulls and their cousins with\n``dangerous dogs'' legislation. A bill before the New York City\nCouncil, for example, would require owners of pit bulls _ defined\nas Staffordshire bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers,\nAmerican pit bull terriers or similar mixed breeds _ to carry\n$100,000 in liability insurance in order to obtain a dog license.\nThose who have worked with and lived with pit bulls maintain that\nsuch legislation will serve only to punish responsible owners and\ntheir dogs, while propagating a misleading stereotype of so-called\n``bully breeds.''\n\n   ``She'll lick you to death,'' Paul Daly, a 37-year-old carpenter\nwho lives in the East Village, said of Eleanor, his pit-bull mix.\nDaly scoffed at the idea his dog might be dangerous. ``The myth of\nthe evil pit bull is just a myth,'' he said. ``They're sweet\ncritters _ very loyal, happy, very calm. If you get the dog as a\npet, it's the best pet you can get.''\n\n   Pit bulls' social nature, combined with their strength, make\nthem good helpers, said Dennis Owens, a 32-year-old Manhattan\nresident who trains dogs to assist the disabled. Owens, who was\ninjured in an elevator accident a little more than 10 years ago,\nuses his pit bull, Asha, to retrieve things for him, and the dogs\ncan also be trained to pull wheelchairs. ``She's the best thing\nthat ever happened to me,'' he said. The emotional support Asha\nprovides is as important to him as the physical support. ``They\nenjoy life, no matter what else is going on,'' he said, explaining\nwhy he chose a pit bull over other breeds. ``They're a lot of fun _\nenjoyable to be around.''\n\n   Of course, many pit bulls do exhibit a nasty streak. According\nto the New York Department of Health, which is responsible for\nenforcing dog-control laws, pit bulls accounted for 294, or 33\npercent, of the 892 dogs held by the department in 1997 for biting\nor other menacing behavior. While other breeds, including German\nshepherds and Rottweilers, also had significant reports of bites,\npit bulls tend to do more damage when they bite, the health\ndepartment commissioner, Neal Cohen, testified before the New York\nCity Council earlier this year.\n\n   But Robin Kovary, a Manhattan dog trainer, said that was no\nreason to punish all pit-bull owners with an insurance requirement.\n``If raised by good people, they're affectionate, intelligent,\ndevoted pets,'' said Kovary, a behavior consultant who has worked\nextensively with pit bulls. Problems arise when owners encourage\naggressive behavior by roughhousing or egging a dog on when it\nbarks or growls. ``They're fantastic dogs in the right hands,'' she\nsaid. ``Unfortunately, a lot of them end up in the wrong hands _\npeople who shouldn't own a hamster.''\n\n   And the requirement will not affect the most dangerous slice of\nthe pit-bull population. A health department spokesman, John Gadd,\nsaid that approximately 90 percent of the dogs seized last year\nwere unlicensed. Gadd maintains that the law will still help, by\ngiving the department more authority to fine such owners and, if\nnecessary, confiscate their dogs.\n\n   Similar bills have been defeated in Toronto, Annapolis, Md., and\nYoungstown, Ohio, largely on the strength of protest from dog\nlovers who claim that breed-specific legislation fails to address\nthe real problem. Pit-bull owners in New York are rallying against\nthe measure.\n\n   Ann Lettis, director of the Responsible Dog Owners Association\nof New York, acknowledged that ``there are people who use dogs as\nlethal weapons.''
