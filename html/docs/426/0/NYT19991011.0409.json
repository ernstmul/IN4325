The money is to be handled by state courts,\nwhich normally would send that money to education.\n\n   The Kansas City Star reported in January that in many cases\npolice simply gave seized money to federal agencies, which kept\npart and returned the rest, usually 80 percent, to police.\n\n   The auditor's report is expected to be addressed in a\nlegislative hearing on the issue today in St. Louis. A copy of the\nreport was obtained by The Star.\n\n   Auditor Claire McCaskill said she hoped the report would educate\nlegislators about the complexity of the issue.\n\n   ``There is not one quick fix to the problems associated with\nforfeitures in Missouri,'' McCaskill said. ``It is going to take an\neffort in several different places to have forfeiture policies\nfollow what the legislative policy intended.''\n\n   Her report, which was based on a survey of law enforcement in\nMissouri, showed that $47 million was seized in the state in a\nthree-year period, with Missouri police agencies receiving more\nthan $19 million back from federal agencies.\n\n   Five agencies, including Kansas City police, received 71 percent\nof the $19 million.\n\n   The report finds several problems in the state law.\n\n   ``Differences between state and federal law, the gray area of\ntask forces and the problems with the way state laws are written\ncreate an environment where local law enforcement circumvents state\nlaw and uses the federal instead,'' McCaskill said.\n\n   According to the report:\n\n   State drug laws need to define when police have actually seized\ncash or property. Currently state law simply requires police to\nreport money they seize to a county prosecutor. But some police\nagencies have said they did not technically seize money in a search\nof a person or property _ they were only holding it until a federal\nagent arrived on the scene.\n\n   Some parts of the law are too restrictive. For example, people\nwho are charged in drug cases must be convicted of a felony before\nthe state can confiscate their property. The law should provide\nsome exemptions to that requirement, the report said.\n\n   Under state law, local officers assigned to a federal task force\nmust still follow state laws when seizing property. But the report\nsays those officers could be subject to conflicting state and\nfederal regulations.\n\n   The report also questions some actions of law enforcement:\n\n   Law enforcement agencies failed to always report to the county\nprosecutor when they seized money or property. ``The prosecutors\nhave not been given the opportunity to determine how to proceed\nwith these potential forfeiture cases,'' according to the report.\n\n   Prosecuting attorneys and the attorney general have interpreted\nstate law to prohibit them from confiscating cash when drugs are\nsuspected but are not present in a search. For that reason,\nofficials have said, law enforcement turns that money over to\nfederal agencies. In actuality, according to the report, cash can\nbe forfeited under state law when no one claims it.\n\n   Even in the small number of cases that were filed in state\ncourt, judges often transferred money to a federal agency, even\nthough they did not need to under state law.\n\n   The report also points out that the $47 million in seizures\nmakes up less than 1 percent of the funding Missouri provides to\nlocal schools. The $3.5 million the Missouri Highway Patrol\nreceived back from the federal government also is less than 1\npercent of its budget.\n\n   Some legislators, however, have said that sending the money to\neducation is not the issue. They say they don't care where the\nmoney goes as long as it doesn't stay with law enforcement. They\nbelieve police agencies that generate revenue by seizures have a\nconflict of interest and an opportunity for abuse.\n\n   McCaskill will release the report today at two news conferences.\n\n   An interim legislative committee that has been holding hearings\non the matter will discuss the report at 10 a.m. today at\nHarris-Stowe State College in St. Louis. The committee is headed by\nSen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, and Rep. Jim Kreider, a\nNixa Democrat and speaker pro tem.\n\n   Some of the seizures in Missouri have involved large sums of\nmoney.\n\n   For example, St. Louis County police officers stopped a vehicle\non Interstate 44 in December 1998 because of traffic violations,\naccording to police reports. Officers searched the car and found\nmore than $1 million. They then notified the DEA, which sent agents\nto the scene to take the money.\n\n   The distribution of the cash is pending. St. Louis County police\nhave said they chose not to comment on the case, and DEA officials\ndid not return phone calls.\n\n   That case did not appear to be among the 104 seizures from seven\nagencies, totaling $11.2 million, that state auditors sampled.\n","Headline":"\nREPORT FINDS FLAWS IN MISSOUR LAW ON SEIZURE OF DRUG MONEY \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Flaws and gray areas in the law allowed\nMissouri law enforcement agencies to circumvent state statutes when\nthey seized drug money, according to a report to be released today.\n","\n   The Missouri auditor's report was undertaken this year because\nof concerns that police had found a way to keep much of the drug\nmoney they seized instead of sending it to public education, as\nlegislators intended.\n","\n   Under state law, police must report all drug money they seize to\ncounty prosecutors.
