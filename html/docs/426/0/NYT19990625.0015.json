Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ An unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives\npersuaded the House of Representatives Thursday to approve\nlegislation to make it much harder for federal and state law\nenforcement authorities to confiscate property before they bring\ncriminal charges in narcotics and other cases.\n\n   By a lopsided vote of 375-48, the House for the first time\nrolled back nearly 30 years of criminal measures passed at the\nheight of what were then called wars on drugs and terrorism. Those\nmeasures substantially broadened the authority of federal and state\nauthorities to seize houses, cars, cash, boats, planes and other\nassets before filing criminal charges. But in recent years the\nseizure of property from people who were never convicted _ and in\nsome cases never even faced charges _ raised concerns among both\nliberals and conservatives that the powers were being abused.\n\n   Stopping short of threatening a veto, the Clinton administration\nopposed the legislation, saying it would make it more difficult to\ncombat crime. A substitute measure diluting many of the central\nfeatures of the bill and supported by the White House was defeated,\n268-155. No similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,\nbut supporters of the House bill said that its huge victory would\nput pressure on the Senate to act.\n\n   The approved measure, which raises the legal standard for\nseizure in federal cases, expands legal defenses and provides\nlawyers to poor property-owners involved in such cases, attracted a\nremarkable coalition of lawmakers and organizations across a broad\nideological spectrum.\n\n   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has spent six years trying to pass\nthe measure, said it ``puts civil liberties back in our judicial\nsystem.'' He likened the current system of confiscation before\nconviction to ``a throwback to the old Soviet Union.''\n\n   After those remarks, the other House Judiciary Committee members\nwho rose to endorse the measure included Rep. John Conyers,\nD-Mich.; Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.; and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.\n\n   What made their alliance so incongruous was the fact that less\nthan a year ago, the four lawmakers had been engaged in a bitterly\nemotional debate over the impeachment of President Clinton, first\nin the House Judiciary Committee, and later on the floor of the\nHouse. Hyde, the conservative chairman of the committee, and Frank,\none of its ranking liberal Democrats, are often foils in law\nenforcement matters.\n\n   But on Thursday they were not only unified in their support of\nthe measure, but also in accord in denouncing the\nadministration-backed weaker substitute.\n\n   Frank called the alternative an effort ``to lower the standards\ntoo low.''\n\n   He was joined in denouncing both current law and the\nadministration's measure by Barr, another traditional political\nopponent, who said that the existing law had ``become the monetary\ntail wagging the law enforcement dog.''\n\n   ``Balancing the important needs of law enforcement means\nstriking the criminal where it hurts, in the pocket book, but not\nwith a blunderbuss,'' said Barr.\n\n   But opponents of the measure said it went too far.\n\n   ``Let us not turn back the clock on the war on drugs,'' said\nRep. Jim Ramstad, D-Minn., a supporter of the alternative bill that\nfailed.\n\n   With a growing number of cases of innocent people seeing their\nassets seized, the lawmakers adopted a bill that would require the\ngovernment to prove ``by clear and convincing evidence'' that the\nproperty was subject to forfeiture because of illegal use.\n\n   Under current law, the burden of proof lies with the person\nwhose property was seized, and the government has to show only\n``probable cause'' that the property is subject to forfeiture, a\nfairly easy standard to satisfy.\n\n   The legislation broadens the available defense to such seizures\nand eliminates the requirement that a property-owner post a 10\npercent bond to challenge a seizure. It also would require the\ngovernment to provide lawyers to property owners who could not\nafford them and gives property owners more time to challenge\nseizures.\n\n   The proposal supported by the Clinton administration would have\nhad a far lower standard for confiscating evidence, permitting\nforfeitures if a ``preponderance of the evidence'' showed they were\npart of a criminal act. The Clinton proposal also would have\nsharply limited the provision that gives property-owners the right\nto have lawyers provided by the government.\n\n   Existing law, which gives wide discretion to federal and state\nlaw enforcement officials to seize property, is the product of\nthree measures adopted since 1970 during a period when Congress\nappeared less preoccupied with civil liberties issues and more\nconcerned about combatting terrorism and drug-trafficking.\n\n   But in recent years, public sentiment has begun to turn about\nthe issue, and was reflected by the breadth of the coalition\npushing for Thursday's measure. The group included the American Bar\nAssociation, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil\nLiberties Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Bankers\nAssociation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,\nthe United States Chamber of Commerce, and pilot, boating, hotel\nand housing organizations.\n\n   (MORE) nn\n\n   Faced with that coalition and powerful anecdotal evidence of\nabusive government conduct, critics of the new legislation were\nunable to counter the growing view that federal forfeiture laws\nwere being stretched beyond reasonable limits.\n\n   Among the examples cited during the congressional debate\nThursday was the case of a landscaper, Willie Jones, who went to a\nNashville, Tenn., airport with $9,000 in cash to travel to Houston\nto buy nursery stock. He was detained at the ticket desk after\npaying for his plane ticket in cash, and he had the rest of his\ncash confiscated after officers told him that anyone carrying that\nmuch money had to be involved in drugs.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Supporters of the bill also pointed to a 1997 case involving the\nseizure of $506,231 in cash from the Congress Pizzeria in Chicago.\nA federal court ordered that the return of the money to the owner,\nAnthony Lombardo, and reminded the U.S. attorney in Chicago that\n``the government may not seize money, even half a million dollars,\nbased on its bare assumption that most people do not have huge sums\nof money lying about, and if they do, they must be involved in\nnarcotics trafficking or some other sinister activity.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   But perhaps the most compelling example of abuses of the law was\nthe seizure by the U.S. attorney's office in Houston of the Red\nCarpet Motel last year. There were no allegations that the hotel's\nowners had participated in any crimes. But prosecutors claimed the\nmanagement had failed to implement ``security measures'' dictated\nby law enforcement officials, including raising room rates to make\nthem less affordable to criminals.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The Clinton administration, supported by local police groups who\nhave reaped millions of dollars in assets from the existing scheme,\nhas strongly opposed the measure. The local law enforcement\norganizations often prefer the federal law because under many\nsimilar state forfeiture laws, the assets seized do not go to law\nenforcement, but to other state agencies. By contrast, the federal\nlaw allows for federal authorities to share any bounty they seize\nwith local law enforcement.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Forfeitures have proved to be a significant source or revenue\nfor the federal government and for local authorities who share in\nthe bounty. As of the end of the last year, a total of 24,903\nseized assets valued at $1 billion were on deposit _ 7,799 cash\nseizures valued at $349 million, 1,181 real properties valued at\n$205 million, 45 businesses valued at $49 million, and 15,878 and\nother assets valued at $398 million.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE)\n\n   This harvest has led critics to conclude that the administration\nhas opposed change largely out of financial interests, an\naccusation that White House officials today denied.\n\n   ``That's just not right,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House\nspokesman. ``This bill would undermine our ability to combat drug\ntrafficking, alien smuggling, terrorism, consumer fraud and many\nother criminal offenses.''\n","Headline":"\nHOUSE APPROVES BILL SCALING BACK POLICE POWER TO SEIZE PROPERTY \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ An unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives\npersuaded the House of Representatives Thursday to approve\nlegislation to make it much harder for federal and state law\nenforcement authorities to confiscate property before they bring\ncriminal charges in narcotics and other cases.\n","\n   By a lopsided vote of 375-48, the House for the first time\nrolled back nearly 30 years of criminal measures passed at the\nheight of what were then called wars on drugs and terrorism.
