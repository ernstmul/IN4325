Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The computer printout that Pat and Ben Christen\npicked up along with their son's medicine contained a litany of\nwarnings: Dry mouth. Constipation. Blurred vision. Drowsiness.\nDizziness. These were just a few of the side effects of the drug\nimipramine, which a psychiatrist had prescribed for their\n7-year-old son, Cory, who suffered from Attention Deficit Disorder.\n\n   Cory Christen had been taking the drug for several months when\nhis second-grade teacher noticed that his hands were trembling. His\nparents checked the warning sheet for guidance, but ``There was\nnothing in it,'' Mrs. Christen said. Soon after, while he was\nleaning over a school water fountain, Cory collapsed and died.\n``His heart just gave out,'' his mother said.\n\n   An autopsy concluded that Cory had overdosed; lawyers for the\nChristens and the doctor, who settled a lawsuit with the parents\nwithout acknowledging wrongdoing, disagree on who was responsible.\nBut experts say Cory's tremors may have been a sign he was getting\ntoo much of the drug: cardiac arrhythmia, a heart-rhythm\ndisturbance, is a well-known side effect.\n\n   Cory's death in his tiny hometown of Weimar, Texas, on Sept. 19,\n1996, highlights what drug safety experts describe as a dangerous\nflaw in the way consumers are informed of the risks of prescription\nmedicines. While officials at the Food and Drug Administration will\nsoon begin requiring standard, easy-to-read labels for all\nover-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements, the government does\nnot control the information that patients receive with prescription\nmedicines, which are typically much more dangerous.\n\n   That is not for lack of trying. Four years ago, the FDA\nannounced a plan to require drug manufacturers to publish ``med\nguides,'' government-approved patient brochures for prescription\ndrugs fashioned after the popular ``nutrition facts'' labels on\nfood. But the plan drew intense opposition from the drug industry\nand pharmacists, and Congress rejected it in 1997, deciding that\nprivate companies could do the job better.\n\n   As a flood of new prescription medications fills the nation's\npharmacy shelves, however, drug safety experts and FDA officials\nare growing increasingly concerned about deaths and injuries from\nthe drugs that the agency approves. And so on Tuesday the FDA put\ninto effect a rule allowing it to require med guides for a handful\nof especially risky prescription medications, no more than 10 each\nyear. The precise drugs will be announced later.\n\n   ``Congress specifically said that we could not implement a\ncomprehensive program, but we felt that there was sufficient\nsupport for us to ensure that people taking these special drugs\nwere warned,'' said Dr. Nancy Ostrove, the agency official in\ncharge of the med guides plan. She said the guides ``will become a\nsignal to consumers that this is a product that you really need to\nbe careful about.''\n\n   But experts in prescription drug safety say the new rule does\nnot go nearly far enough.\n\n   ``On boxes of cereal we have a very standard label that tells\nthe content, and it is the same on every one of them,'' complained\nDr. Lucian L. Leape, a health policy analyst at the Harvard School\nof Public Health. ``I don't know why cereal is more important than\nmedicines.''\n\n   Scientists estimate that more than 100,000 hospital patients\neach year die of reactions to their medication, and 2.2 million are\ninjured. At least some of those deaths, Leape and others say, could\nbe prevented if patients had clear, concise information about how\nto use their medication.\n\n   In the absence of government-approved guides, consumers are left\nto rely primarily on computer printouts of the sort the Christens\nreceived. But few people realize that these printouts, called\n``patient information leaflets,'' are manufactured by private\ncompanies and are not required by any government agency.\n\n   Drug stores distribute the leaflets voluntarily, but not all do\nso. And authorities on drug safety complain that the leaflets are\ninconsistent; they say the pamphlets vary from pharmacy to pharmacy\nand omit information or contain errors that contribute to deaths.\n\n   The voluntary system is the result of more than two decades of\ndebate among regulators, the pharmaceutical industry and consumer\nadvocates about how to provide patients with accurate, complete\ninformation about the risks of prescription drugs. At the crux of\nthe discussion is a delicate risk-versus-benefit analysis: experts\nwant consumers to be well-informed about the risks that drugs\ncarry, but they do not want to scare patients away from taking\nmedicine that might save their lives.\n\n   In the late 1970s, the FDA tried to require drug companies to\nprovide written information for consumers, but the plan was quashed\nby the Reagan administration. In 1995, Dr. David Kessler, then the\ncommissioner of Food and Drugs, resurrected the idea with the med\nguides plan.\n\n   ``I went to pick up a prescription for my daughter the other\nday,'' Kessler said in a recent interview. ``There were all these\nlittle stickers on it and they were covering each other and I had\nto peel them off. That's no way to provide information.''\n\n   But pharmacists complained about the FDA's plan to restrict the\ncontent of the guides to information about government-approved uses\nof the drugs. Doctors can prescribe medications ``off-label'' for\nany condition; the drug thalidomide, for instance, is commonly used\nto treat AIDS but was initially approved only for leprosy. The\nFDA's med guides, pharmacists argued, would leave many patients\nill-informed.\n\n   Drug manufacturers also objected, fearing that they would be\nsued if they provided patients with a condensed, simpler version of\nthe risk information they were already required to give doctors.\n\n   And, said Marjorie Powell, a lawyer for a drug industry trade\ngroup, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the\nmanufacturers feared that if the FDA had to approve information\ngiven patients, it would take longer to get new drugs approved.\n``We didn't need to convert a commercial program into a\ngovernment-run program,'' she said. Congress was sympathetic and\nrejected Kessler's plan.\n\n   The result was a compromise adopted by the Department of Health\nand Human Services: by next year, 75 percent of all prescriptions\nmust be accompanied by leaflets that contain ``useful''\ninformation; by 2006, the figure must rise to 95 percent. If those\nstandards have not been met the FDA will be free to propose the med\nguides plan again.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The agency is now trying to determine how close the voluntary\nsystem is to meeting the goal. Dr. Ostrove said the agency was\nevaluating the leaflets in more than 350 pharmacies in about 10\nstates, and planned to conduct a larger study next year.\n\n   Dr. Raymond Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at\nthe Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, said a\nstudy he conducted several years ago found that ``a third of the\ntime people get nothing, and what they do get is often inadequate\nor misleading.''\n\n   In 1997, Public Citizen published an analysis of the patient\ninformation leaflets for 18 different pain relievers in the class\nknown as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It found that only\none-fourth of the leaflets warned patients to stop the drug if they\nexperienced abdominal pain, a symptom that can signal serious, and\npotentially life-threatening, internal bleeding.\n\n   The leaflet that Cory Christen's parents were given, for\nexample, contained no information on serious, lasting side effects\nof imipramine.\n\n   Thomas J. Moore, a drug safety expert at the George Washington\nUniversity Medical Center, said that was not surprising; he said\nthe leaflets typically leave out information about the most dire\nside effects.\n\n   Historically, it has been left to doctors and pharmacists to\neducate their patients about the dangers of prescription drugs. But\nwith the rise of managed health care, doctors have less time to\ntalk to their patients. In a 1997 survey of 1,000 patients, the FDA\nfound that only one-third had received information from their\ndoctors about the dangerous side effects of drugs they were taking.\nPharmacists, too, say they are often too busy filling prescriptions\nto counsel patients.\n\n   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health\nResearch Group, an advocacy organization based in Washington, says\nthis is all the more reason to have government-approved med guides\nfor all drugs.\n\n   ``You need to have some backup,'' he said. ``And the backup is a\nmandatory patient information leaflet.''\n\n   The printout that accompanied Cory Christen's prescription was\nproduced by Medi-Span Inc. of Indianapolis, one of a number of\ncommercial vendors that supply computer software to pharmacies.\nCiting the lawsuit, the company declined to comment.
