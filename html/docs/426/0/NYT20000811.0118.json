It's the equivalent of ``putting a peep hole in\na every new home through which law enforcement can look.'' He said\nthe rule ``means that cell phones become location-tracking devices,\nwhich can be used to monitor our movements.''\n\n   Nearly 100 million Americans use cell phones. In an era when an\never-increasing amount of communications and commerce _ including\nInternet activity _ is conducted over cellular phones, the rule\ncould disrupt a fragile balance between the privacy needs of\nindividuals and the investigation needs of law enforcement.\n\n   David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy\nInformation Center, a watchdog group, said the potential government\npowers ``raise significant privacy issues.'' The government is\n``seeking surveillance capabilities that far exceed the powers law\nenforcement has had in the past and is entitled to under the law,''\nhe added.\n\n   Shari Steele, executive director of the Electronic Frontier\nFoundation, a privacy oversight group based in San Francisco, said\nthat the proposed rule is ``a really, really big grab'' to expand\ngovernment's investigative powers.\n\n   For example, under current federal rules, if investigators want\nto tap a phone, either a cell phone or a regular one, they must get\npermission from a judge. As part of the petition for a wiretap\nwarrant, the agency must provide the court with evidence of\nprobable cause that the suspect whose phone is to be tapped is\nengaging in criminal activity.\n\n   But under the new rule, law enforcement would gain the\nadditional power to track the approximate location of a cell phone\nuser without having to ask a judge. ``That gives them a tremendous\namount of power they didn't have before,'' Steele said.\n\n   The technology exists to allow investigators to determine the\ngeneral location of a cell phone user. The country is divided into\n``cells'' several miles wide that provide service for cell phone\nusers. By knowing in what cell a call begins and ends,\ninvestigators glean a fairly good understanding of a user's\nmovements.\n\n   The government disagrees with the privacy critics, asserting\nthat law enforcement agencies need to be able to monitor cell\nphones in order to keep pace with criminals, who are increasingly\nturning to the devices and to the Internet to conduct illicit\ndealings.\n\n   The Justice Department said in a court filing in Washington that\nprivacy interests ``are adequately protected'' under the rule.\n\n   Meanwhile, the use of wiretaps is surging. In 1999, the number\nof wiretaps ordered by federal and local authorities on pagers,\ncell phones, e-mail and faxes increase about 20 percent over the\nprevious year, pushing the total number of government wiretaps to a\nrecord 1,350, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.\nCourts. The Justice Department accounted for 601 of the\ncourt-approved wiretaps.\n\n   About three-quarters of the wiretaps were used in drug\ninvestigations.\n\n   In one high-profile case last year, federal agents arrested 98\npeople in a drug-smuggling ring stretching from El Paso to the\nNortheast. The arrests in part were facilitated by the use of a\n`roving wiretap'' to track the use of several cell phones used in\ndrug transactions.\n\n   The FBI recently ran headlong into a major controversy over\nanother digital-age eavesdropping capability known as Carnivore.\nCarnivore scans the Internet and captures ``packets,'' the standard\nunit of digital communication that the FBI also is seeking in the\ncell phone rule.\n\n   Carnivore, which would be installed at Internet service\nproviders like America Online, scours the on-line activities of a\nsuspect. Members of Congress and privacy groups, outraged that the\ndevice gives the FBI access to the entirety of the Internet\nprovider's electronic traffic, assert that the system is rife for\npotential abuse.\n\n   At issue in the cell phone case is a proposed Federal\nCommunications Commission regulation issued at the behest of the\nJustice Department nearly one year ago. It directed that by Sept.\n30, 2001, cellular phone companies must be able to provide\nauthorities with the general location of cellular phone users.\nUnder the order, the police may obtain location information based\nwhere a call originated and ended.\n\n   In addition, the rule directs that cell phone companies create\neavesdropping-friendly networks for investigators. Without the need\nfor a wiretap warrant, the government wants:\n\n   _ To be able to capture in real time the digits that a cell\nphone user dials after a call is connected, such as call-forwarding\ntelephone numbers or digits used to access credit card and bank\naccounts;\n\n   _ To be able to capture so-called ``packet-mode\ncommunications,'' which contain the content of a telephone call or\ndata transmission broken down into electronic chunks.\n\n   The actions ``will help ensure that law enforcement has the most\nup-to-date technology to fight crime,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard\nsaid.\n\n   But a coalition of privacy rights organizations and cellular\nindustry associations, including those mentioned above, is fighting\nthe rule in U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A\nruling could come as soon as this month.\n\n   The groups argue that under the proposed rule the ``packets''\ncontaining the actual content of a call could be easily accessed by\ninvestigators without a formal wiretap warrant.\n\n   Theodore Olson, a lawyer who represents the Cellular\nTelecommunications Industry Association and Center for Democracy\nand Technology, said, ``Our objection is that the FCC wants the\ntelephone companies to provide information to law enforcement\ninvolving content _ without a wiretap'' order.\n\n   ``Law enforcement would get a lot of content under this. They\ndon't get it all, but they'd get a lot,'' Olson said.\n\n   The government counters that the concerns of privacy groups are\noverstated.\n\n   The FCC said in written arguments filed with the court that\nthere should be no concern about using cell phones to obtain the\nlocation of suspects.\n\n   ``Information revealing the approximate location of wireless\ncallers ... is no different from the location information that\nresults from the detection of a telephone number in the landline\nsystem,'' the agency said.\n\n   Stephen Colgate, an assistant U.S. attorney general, added in an\ninterview that investigators have no intention of turning ``cell\nphones into a real-time homing devices.'' To do so, he said, would\nrequire a court-ordered wiretap, and would only be done if\nabsolutely necessary. He cited the example of tracking the\nmovements of a suspected kidnapper.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.

If law enforcement wants access to\nthe content of cell phone calls, investigators will get the proper\nwarrant, he added.\n\n   Colgate said that the privacy and industry coalition has an\nunreasonable fear about ``rogue law enforcement operations'' as\nepitomized during the long reign of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\n   ``I'm not willing to buy in that we're going to have the Hoover\nera of the 1950s and 1960s over again,'' Colgate said.\n\n   Such assurances do little to assuage the concerns of the ACLU's\nSteinhardt.\n\n   ``Their arguments come down to this: `Trust us.
