DiNapoli's funeral Tuesday.\n\n   The arrest was announced at DiNapoli's wake Monday afternoon,\nand hundreds of the officer's friends, family, and colleagues\napplauded.\n\n   ``It means there is a closure to John DiNapoli's death,''\nHolyoke Police Chief Marc Cournoyer said at a news conference. ``It\ndoesn't lessen our pain, but at least we're relieved he's in\ncustody and no one else got hurt.''\n\n   Scranton police arrested Eddie Morales, 27, of Holyoke, as he\nleft his car in a strip mall parking lot about 4:45 p.m., Scranton\nDetective Robert Brenzel said. Morales surrendered without\nincident.\n\n   Morales allegedly shot DiNapoli, 52, five times while the\noff-duty patrol officer was chasing him in an unmarked car last\nWednesday.

Cournoyer refused to specify what leads brought the\nsearch to Scranton.\n\n   Local police staked out the residence where Morales was staying\nand followed him when he left. They seized him when he stopped his\ncar in a parking lot, Brenzel said. About 20 officers participated\nin the arrest.\n\n   ``There was no fight at all,'' Brenzel said. ``I think he was\njust overwhelmed by the whole thing.''\n\n   Relations between police and Hispanics in Holyoke are strained.\nLatinos make up half of the city's population of 45,000. Some in\nthe community have accused law enforcement officials of\ninsensitivity. Some activists had feared that Morales might not\nlive if he resisted arrest.\n\n   When in court Tuesday, authorities will request Morales be\nreturned to Massachusetts to face murder charges, Hampden District\nAttorney William Bennett said.\n\n   Morales's capture ends an exhaustive search that strained\ngrieving members of the Holyoke police force, as well as DiNapoli's\nfriends and family.\n\n   ``We've been going 24 hours a day since this started, and I\nthank God we were able to put everybody's mind at ease,'' Cournoyer\nsaid. ``This man's capture has certainly relieved the community of\nHolyoke and made . . . the entire Western Massachusetts community\nsleep a little better this evening.''\n\n   The news of the arrest brought a moment of excitement for the\nrelatives and colleagues attending the officer's wake. ``A lot of\ntears, a lot of hugging,'' police chaplain Bill Hamilton said.\n\n   Holyoke officials and police unions had offered a $50,000 reward\nfor information leading to an arrest and conviction.
