R. Donald Kiernan ``monsignor,''\nthe honorary title awarded by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\nAtlanta for special service. You can call him ``captain,'' the rank\nhe holds with the Georgia State Patrol. You can call him\n``colonel,'' his rank in the DeKalb County (Ga.) police department.\nOr, you can call him ``doctor'' for the honorary criminal justice\ndegree he received from Georgia State University last year.\n\n   On May 8, Kiernan will celebrate 50 years as a Roman Catholic\npriest and 50 years as a Georgian. Both Kiernan's fellow priests\nand his fellow police officers are looking forward to the\nfestivities.\n\n   ``There's going to be a hell of a party,'' says Lt. Ric Clark of\nDeKalb County's north police precinct. There will also be a Mass at\n7 p.m. at the 3,300-family All Saints Catholic Church in Dunwoody\n(Ga.), where Kiernan is pastor.\n\n   He was ordained in Boston for the Diocese of Savannah (Ga.)_\nwhich then covered all of Georgia _ in 1949. After half a century\nin Georgia, he still maintains his Massachusetts accent.\n\n   His record in law enforcement rivals his record in the church:\nHe was a founder of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police and\nthe organization's director and chaplain, and has served as\nchaplain of the International Association of Chiefs of Police,\nGeorgia State Patrol, DeKalb County police department, Georgia\nBureau of Investigation, Atlanta office of the U.S. Treasury's\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Metropol, a\ncooperative agency of local police and corporations.\n\n   In the archdiocese, he has pastored churches in Savannah,\nLaGrange (Ga.) and throughout North Georgia, was editor of The\nGeorgia Bulletin archdiocesan newspaper for 13 years, and now\nserves as a member of the marriage tribunal, considering\napplications for annulment.\n\n   ``He's one of the most popular priests in the whole\narchdiocese,'' says Archbishop John F. Donoghue. ``He's very\nwell-respected by priests and laity alike.''\n\n   Kiernan won't give his age, but the archbishop lets slip that he\nis the oldest active priest in the archdiocese.\n\n   His relationship with law enforcement began in the early 1950s\nwith a call to Atlanta police about a prowler in the basement of\nAtlanta's Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, where he was\nassistant pastor. Two young officers, M.C. Faulkner and A.L. Posey\n_ Kiernan remembers their names immediately _ responded and asked\nthe equally young priest to ride along with them.\n\n   ``Sure 'nuff, the next night they came around and asked me\nagain,'' says Kiernan. And again, and again.\n\n   Kiernan met sergeants, lieutenants and the then-Atlanta police\nchief, the late Herbert Jenkins, who became a close friend.\n\n   When assigned to a church in Cedartown, Kiernan realized there\nwas no state police academy to train officers in small towns. He\nset up training for North Georgia officers, with help from Jenkins.\n\n   In 1962, while pastor of St. Michael's Church in Gainesville, he\nhelped found the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police because he\nsaw a need for heads of law enforcement agencies to be able to work\ntogether and learn from each other.\n\n   He's been a member of the International Association of Chiefs of\nPolice since the 1950s, riding to meetings held in the United\nStates because he will not fly.\n\n   Maj. Gene Moss, commander of DeKalb County's north police\nprecinct, drove Kiernan to a meeting in Florida in 1997. ``There\nwere 16,000 people,'' says Moss. ``I may be exaggerating some, but\nI really believe he knew 15,000 of them by first name. I have never\nseen anybody know so many police officers.''\n\n   Marietta Police Chief Bobby Moody met Kiernan shortly after he\nbecame police chief in Covington in 1978 when he was 30 years old.\n\n   ``He literally took me by the hand at a Metropol meeting, the\nfirst one my wife and I went to, and introduced us to everybody,''\nsays Moody. ``For me, it was a bit of culture shock as a little\ncountry boy from Covington to meet chiefs from Atlanta and Fulton\nCounty.''\n\n   As a Baptist, Moody said he also experienced a bit of culture\nshock watching Kiernan play host and bartender in the hotel's\nhospitality suite. ``I was mesmerized by this little priest running\naround taking care of people,'' says Moody.\n\n   Moody says he feels very close to Kiernan. ``I seek out the\nmonsignor when I need somebody I can just talk to,'' he says. ``We\nplay golf together. He's not the best golfer in the world and wants\nto use an eraser on the score card, but as far as I'm concerned,\nthe monsignor gets any score he wants.''\n\n   Kiernan's reputation extends even to officers who don't know him\npersonally. He tells this story on himself:\n\n   Driving to Gainesville one day, Kiernan was pulled over by a\nGwinnett County deputy who began, typically, ``Do you know how fast\nyou were going?''\n\n   ``83,'' said Kiernan.\n\n   ``I didn't clock you that fast,'' said the deputy.\n\n   ``I saw the blue light and slowed down,'' said the monsignor.\n\n   ``You sure are an honest man,'' said the deputy. ``What are\nthose antennas on your car?''\n\n   ``I'm chaplain for the Georgia State Patrol,'' said the\nmonsignor.\n\n   ``Oh, you're the masseur, aren't you?'' said the deputy.\n\n   Kiernan got off with a warning.\n\n   Although Kiernan clearly enjoys his relationship with police\nofficers, some of his duties with them are deadly serious. He\naccompanies officials to inform family members of deaths, performs\nfunerals for officers who are not affiliated with a church, and\ncounsels police struggling with family and spiritual concerns.\n\n   Kiernan expresses great admiration for police officers.\n\n   ``I think any job in the world where you have to wear a\nbulletproof vest to work should be better compensated,'' he says.\n``In business today, you find dog-eat-dog. What attracts me to them\nis they care for one another.''\n\n   But Kiernan says he has no desire to be an amateur investigator\nhimself, in the tradition of fictional priest-detectives such as\nAndrew Greeley's Father Blackie Ryan.\n\n   ``I've got a parish and I'm busy,'' he says. ``I don't know how\nFather Ryan has the time.''\n\n   Gayle White writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ You can call the Rev.
