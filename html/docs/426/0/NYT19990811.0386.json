Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ A young girl was chatting with a friend in the\nnortheast section of Central Park on Wednesday when a pigeon fell\nat her feet, dead.\n\n   The girl, Victoria Sweet, 11, said that she and her friend\n``were just scared and sad to watch Mother Nature just fall from\nthe tree.''\n\n   Between Tuesday morning and Wednesday afternoon, 30 pigeons, 10\nsparrows, one grackle and two ducks were discovered dead in the\npark, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said at a news conference\nnear the Harlem Meer. And yes, he said, poisoning was suspected, as\nstricken birds continued to fall to the ground.\n\n   ``The poisoning of innocent animals is an outrage,'' Stern said,\nquickly acknowledging that the precise cause of death would not be\nknown until state conservation authorities in Albany completed\nautopsies in about two weeks.\n\n   But the commissioner said he strongly suspected that the Central\nPark birds were being killed by the same fiend who has been\ntargeting city birds since 1997.\n\n   In August of that year, the first evidence of poisoning emerged\nwhen a sick red-tailed hawk was found on Fifth Avenue and 74th\nStreet. The hawk, which was found to have ingested a very powerful\npesticide called carbofuran, recovered. But the hawk's mother was\nkilled by the same poison two months later. Since pigeons are the\nprincipal food of hawks, Parks Department investigators reasoned\nthat the hawks must have eaten pigeons that had been fed poisoned\nseed.\n\n   The poisonings continued in July 1998, when there were numerous\nreports of dead pigeons from the Upper East Side and West Side to\nTimes Square. Forty dead sparrows were found in a parking lot on\n97th Street and Columbus Avenue.\n\n   In the fall of 1998, several groups of 10 to 20 dead pigeons\nwere found on the Upper East Side. Autopsies revealed carbofuran in\nthe bodies.\n\n   Stern said that the culprit faced criminal prosecution, though\nhe did not yet know what specific city or state law would be\napplicable. Killing the ducks, sparrows and grackle would be a\nviolation of the Federal Migratory Bird Act, he said.\n\n   Stern said he would ask the Manhattan district attorney for a\njail sentence for the perpetrator. ``As long as he's on the loose,\nthe pigeons and ducks and birds of this park are in danger,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   A reward of $1,000 has been offered by the City Parks\nFoundation, a private philanthropic group, for information leading\nto the arrest and conviction of the bird killer.\n\n   Parks Department workers discovered the first dead birds on\nTuesday morning. Seeds and bread crumbs at the scene were collected\nfor examination. Police emergency tape blocks off the areas where\nthe crumbs and seeds were found, and law enforcement officers are\non duty to steer children and dog walkers away, said Bob Lawson, a\ndepartment spokesman.\n\n   The commissioner acknowledged that his agency often complained\nabout pigeons and that he had many times advised the public not to\nfeed them. But, he emphasized, the Parks Department does not kill\nthem. Ed Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said\nthat no city agency killed pigeons or any other birds.\n\n   Building owners can legally control the pigeon population by\nemploying a trained and licensed exterminator who uses the\npesticide Avitrol. Both houses of the State Legislature passed a\nbill allowing localities to ban the use of Avitrol, but the bill\nwas vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki.
