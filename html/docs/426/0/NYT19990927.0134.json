Some experts warn that they can be\nriddled with problems, such as unethical advertising, conflicts of\ninterest or simply bad advice.\n\n   Some, including the medical profession's governing body, the\nAmerican Medical Association, are suggesting that online health\nsites should be held to medicine's standards of trustworthiness.\n\n   Leading health Web sites acknowledge that establishing\ncredibility is one of their toughest challenges, but they say that\nconsumers hold them to high standards.\n\n   ``Everything we do, it's all about establishing that trusted\nrelationship in the online world,'' said Don Hackett, chief\nexecutive of Austin's drkoop.com, the most popular health-related\nsite on the Internet, attracting an estimated 3.5 million visitors\na month. ``In the online world ... all the information glows with\nthe same intensity, whether it's accurate or not.''\n\n   But some say the industry should establish policies for ensuring\naccuracy and disclosing the conflicts of interest that come along\nwith mixing content and commerce, the lifeblood of most Internet\nbusinesses.\n\n   ``Every one of those ventures has a profit motive, so the\ninformation is always going to be suspect to profiteering,'' said\nEric Weidmann, an Austin physician who occasionally reviews\nhealth-related Web sites.\n\n   Weidmann is a proponent of patients' use of the Web to find\nhealth information and support. But like others, he points out that\nbecause most Web sites are businesses that depend on profits, they\nare ``suspect to reliability and motive.''\n\n   CREDIBILITY CONCERNS\n\n   For an idea of what's driving some of the medical profession's\nconcern about health Web sites, hit the Internet.\n\n   Behind the scenes at most health Web sites, you won't find many\ndoctors _ or few people with any medical training, for that matter.\n\n   Instead, the online health sites are typically operated by\nentrepreneurs, former health-care executives, techies and\njournalists, bringing together content from a variety of sources\nwhile using their own and others' personal experience to dispense\nadvice.\n\n   At drkoop.com, for instance, co-founder and namesake C. Everett\nKoop, the former U.S. surgeon general, has little to do with the\ndaily operation of the drkoop.com, though his name and reputation\nlend credibility to the company.\n\n   ``We had perceived that Dr. Koop had a personal interest in\nmaking sure this was credible information, so we jumped on the\nbandwagon to allow our patients to have another source of\ninformation,'' said David Morehead, president of the Scott & White\nHealth Plan, part of the Temple health-care system that is paying\ndrkoop.com $40,000 a year for packaged medical content and a place\non its list of preferred hospitals.\n\n   Search the major consumer health sites today and you might find\ninconsistent answers and advice to questions on typical health\nproblems. One site might suggest taking vitamins is a good way for\ntreating a strain of hepatitis, for example, while another site\nmight advise that vitamins do no good.\n\n   Sometimes, the advice some Web health sites give is just plain\nwrong.\n\n   A study in the the August edition of the journal Cancer found\ndangerous inaccuracies in cancer data in a sample of 400 health\ninformation sites, nearly half of which had not been subjected to\nscientific scrutiny, typically a key step in the publication of\narticles in medical journals. The study's author listed only a\nhandful of sites, including, drkoop.com, that she considered\ncredible and reliable.\n\n   Few people _ if any _ are going to get advice on treating cancer\nsolely off an Internet site. Most sites, in fact, are careful not\nto offer extensive advice for any conditions and to always warn\nthat their information is not a substitute for a physician's\nadvice.\n\n   But some critics say visitors to almost any health Web site\nshould beware of what is becoming perhaps the most frequent\ncriticism of Web sites: potential conflicts of interest. Web\ncompanies' methods of linking information and advertising, some\ndoctors and medical ethicists say, are rife with the potential for\nmisrepresentation and bias.\n\n   Last week, a news report revealed that a women's health Internet\nsite based in California, WomenFirst, had been paid to promote\nbrand-name prescription drugs written about regularly in its\narticles.\n\n   Closer to home, the AMA recently pointed out that drkoop.com had\nnot detailed to consumers how C. Everett Koop profited from the\nsite.\n\n   ``Originally, that Web site did not give full disclosure,'' said\nRobert Tenery, a Dallas ophthalmologist who sits on the American\nMedical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,\nwhich is examining online medicine.\n\n   ``There were profits being made that I would assume the casual\nviewer would not recognize,'' he said. ``For someone who's looking\nfor important medical points, not reading every line, it would be\ndifficult to determine there was a conflict of interest there.''\n\n   Koop, who lives in New Hampshire, was not available for comment.\nExecutives at drkoop.com say the site has always fully disclosed\nits sponsors, but last month it took steps to further separate\nadvertising and content on the site and change wording to clarify\nthe nature of paid partnerships with health-care companies,\nincluding hospitals. The company also killed an arrangement to pay\nroyalties on commercial activity on the site to Koop, known to many\nAmericans as a tough, unimpeachable advocate for the public's\nhealth.\n\n   Koop, meanwhile, is helping form an industry group that will\ncreate a code of ethics for the e-health industry. Other sites are\nalready posting their advertising policies, hoping to avoid\ncontroversy.\n\n   ``I think we're being extremely oriented towards disclosure\nnow,'' said Dennis Upah, drkoop.com's chief operating officer.\n\n   GROWING POPULARITY\n\n   Chalk it up to dissatisfaction with rushed doctor's visits or\njust our growing reliance on the Internet for information: Health\ncare is one of the hottest topics on the Web.\n\n   By some estimates, 25,000 sites on the Internet offer\ninformation on health and medical conditions. Last month, more than\n13 million people logged onto Internet health sites, according to a\nstudy released recently by research group PC Data Inc.\n\n   ``We're in a rapid transition where people have a hunger for\nmedical knowledge, and I think many of us are frustrated with our\nability to provide that with the level of validity that the\npatients want,'' said Morehead of the Scott & White Health Plan.\n``I look at it in a sense as an experiment in society as to how\nbest to provide valid information to help them make up their\nminds.''\n\n   The entities behind major health sites vary from prestigious\nmedical centers such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and M.D.\nAnderson Cancer Center in Houston to for-profit companies like\ndrkoop.com and Healthanswers.com in Austin.\n\n   (Austin360.com, a sister company to the Austin\nAmerican-Statesman, runs health information purchased from a\nvariety of companies. The Seton HealthCare Network also pays to be\nthe local sponsor of health content.)\n\n   To grow quickly, most commercial sites have built business by\nsigning up partners, now the established way of expanding your\naudience on the Internet.\n\n   Drkoop.com may be the best case study of how to build a\nsuccessful commercial health site.\n\n   There, partners such as America Online and the GO Network\nprovide ready audiences of millions of subscribers who want\nconsumer health information, and they link to health-care sites\nfrom their well-trafficked gateways. With an audience in place,\ndrugstore chains, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and\nclinical trials companies rush to sign up as partners and place ads\nor sponsorships on the site.\n\n   The result is that a site that didn't exist 15 months ago now\nhas numerous partners promoting it online and off, many of them\npaying for the privilege. Local television stations run commercials\nfor drkoop.com and exchange medical information and health stories\nwith the site. The maker of Nicorette and Nicoderm, two smoking\ncessation products, sponsors the section on ``Tackling Tobacco'' on\ndrkoop.com. The sponsorships, like those on other sites, are\nclearly labeled.\n\n   But when about 20 hospitals _ including Scott & White _ showed\nup on drkoop.com's list of preferred ``Community Partners,''\nwithout noting that they had paid to be on the list, the AMA cried\nfoul. A company spokeswoman said the wording of that page was\nchanged around Aug. 20.\n\n   Executives at drkoop.com say they keep content and advertising\nas separate as church and state, won't accept content from\nadvertisers and routinely turn down advertising from companies they\nfeel are disreputable. Other sites, such as healthanswers.com,\nintelihealth.com and onhealth.com, have similar policies.\n\n   The AMA wants sites to go out of their way to delineate paid\nadvertising and medical information or advice and let consumers\nknow which is which.\n\n   ``There's nothing out there that says that Dr. Koop can't make\nmoney giving advice on a Web site,'' said Tenery. ``That's not the\nquestion. It all goes back to one thing and that's disclosure.''\nMajor commercial health sites say their content is evaluated by\ndoctors and noted to show where it came from.\n\n   Yet that isn't always the case.\n\n   On healthanswers.com, for instance, only the fine print tells\nthe source of entries in its ``library,'' and there is no mention\nof who wrote the content, who reviewed it or when it was updated.\nThe information is purchased from the medical encyclopedia adam.com\nand reviewed by doctors there, company officials said.\n\n   Likewise, on drkoop.com, pages about such conditions as asthma,\nendometriosis and HIV are credited only to the company and do not\ndetail who wrote or reviewed them. The company says it is reviewed\nby doctors at Dartmouth Medical School.\n\n   In online support groups and message boards common on many\nhealth sites, information flows more freely and usually is posted\nby lay people, not doctors.\n\n   ``Our hosts know that they're not an authority, they're not a\ncounselor, they're not a physician,'' said Todd Woodward,\ndrkoop.com's executive community producer. ``Whatever you hear here\nis not authoritative. But there's always going to be people sharing\nGrandma's remedy for a sore knee or whatever.''\n\n   With health sites treading closer to the territory of doctors,\nthey know they will have to be more careful because they will be\njudged on their content, not their ability to attract attention.\n\n   ``As we feel our way along some of those bumpy points,\ndrkoop.com got called on some things that are not way over the edge\nbut certainly questionable,'' said Bob Pringle, president of\nintelihealth.com, an online venture between insurance giant\nAetna/US Healthcare and Johns Hopkins Medical School. ``That\ndoesn't mean that people couldn't point fingers.
