But The Kansas City Star reported in January that police\nhad found a way to divert millions of dollars and keep it.  \n\n   They simply turn the money over to a federal agency, which takes\na portion and gives the rest back to police.  \n\n   The bill that passed Thursday included several provisions that\nwould make it harder for federal law enforcement agencies to\nconfiscate money and property in suspected drug crimes. The bill,\nsponsored by Reps. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, and John\nConyers, a Michigan Democrat, passed 375 to 48.  \n\n   All Missouri representatives voted for it.  \n\n   The amendment that addresses the Missouri situation was added\nthis week in response to the stories published in The Star, Hyde's\noffice said.  \n\n   However, Thursday's action doesn't solve the Missouri problem.  \n\n   First the bill must go to the Senate, where its fate is\nuncertain. And if it passes there, Missouri officials said, it\nwon't entirely close loopholes police are using.  \n\n   Still, several state legislators who are working on their own\nforfeiture reform bills said Thursday they welcomed help from\nCongress.  \n\n   ``I'm just really glad to hear this because I didn't know the\nfederal government had listened to our pleas that we had\nproblems,'' said Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and speaker pro\ntem.  \n\n   Kreider is leading a Missouri House interim committee that will\nbegin meeting in late summer to review state forfeiture laws.  \n\n   State Auditor Claire McCaskill also said she was pleased by the\nHyde-Conyers bill. McCaskill has surveyed the seizure process of\nalmost all law enforcement in Missouri and is conducting several\naudits of police department seizure funds. She expects to report\nher findings to the legislature in late summer.  \n\n   ``I think probably the very best way to clear up any abuses of\ncircumvention of state law is to change federal law,'' McCaskill\nsaid. ``If you don't change the federal law, enforcement of the\nstate law will continue to be a very time-consuming and onerous\nprocess.''  \n\n   A Department of Justice document shows that in Missouri police\nhave turned over to the federal government in three years an\nestimated $19 million and received back $15 million.  \n\n   Stephen Hill, U.S. attorney for the Western District, would not\ncomment on Hyde's amendment.  \n\n   But in the past, Hill and other law enforcement officials have\ndefended their actions, saying they don't break state law.  \n\n   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, who represents the Highway\nPatrol, could not be reached for comment because he was out of\nstate, his spokesman said.   \n\n   Officials for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration did\nnot return phone calls this week.  \n\n   The agency has a policy that seizures should be pursued in state\ncourt if they were part of a state investigation. But in March, the\nagency said the responsibility to follow state laws belongs to\npolice.\n\n   ``Each state and local agency is expected to follow all\nappropriate laws and regulations,'' the agency said in a written\nstatement. The agency has refused to comment further.  \n\n   For their part, local and state police have maintained they did\nnot violate a state law that specifically prohibits them from\ntransferring a seizure to a federal agency.  \n\n   Police say they never actually seize the money or property they\ntransfer to a federal agency; They are merely holding it until a\nfederal agency can ``officially'' seize it.  \n\n   John Waldeck, an attorney for the Kansas City school board,\nraised concerns that Hyde's bill would not cover the seizure\nissue.  \n\n   ``There has to be a bear trap in any legislation that they put\nout which clearly establishes what a state seizure is,'' Waldeck\nsaid. ``That all has to be spelled out in spades so you can't\nmonkey with the circumstances.''  \n\n   The school district has filed a class action lawsuit against all\nlaw enforcement in Missouri to recover all drug money police have\nseized since 1986.  \n\n   On Friday, state Sen. Harry Wiggins said the seizure issue would\nbe corrected in Missouri.  \n\n   ``We can address that here, and I will find a way to do that,''\nWiggins said.  \n\n   U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who helped move the\nforfeiture bill to the House floor, mocked the police stance on\nwhen a seizure becomes a seizure.  \n\n   `` `We didn't seize the money -- we just held the money,' ''\nBlunt said. ``I wouldn't want to be on their side if they litigated\nthis. I think they would lose.''  \n\n   The Missouri provision of the Hyde-Conyers bill would require\nthe proceeds from a federal forfeiture to be distributed according\nto state law when a state or local law enforcement agency has been\n``directly involved'' in seizing the money or property.  \n\n   Many Missouri legislators have said they do not want police\nagencies generating revenue for themselves because they fear it\nleads to conflicts of interest that can lead to illegal searches\nand seizures.  \n\n   Hyde made that argument Thursday during debate on the bill.  \n\n   ``You don't have a chance at equal justice,'' he said.  \n\n   The bill is Hyde's latest attempt to correct police abuses when\ntaking people's property. In fact, he has written a book on the\nsubject.  \n\n   Besides the Missouri provision, the measure also will require\nthe federal government to prove property it wants to keep is\nrelated to a crime. Currently the owner must prove the property is\n``innocent.''  \n\n   The measure also provides attorneys for people who are poor and\neliminates a bond that must be paid by the owner in order to\ncontest a seizure, usually $5,000 or 10 percent of the value of the\nproperty.  \n\n   The forfeiture issue has brought together an odd consortium in\nsupport of Hyde's bill: conservative and liberal politicians such\nas Hyde and Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, the ACLU and the\nNational Rifle Association.  \n\n   The bill now goes to the Senate, where it has been reported that\nthe Justice Department and powerful law enforcement lobbying\nassociations are gearing up to oppose the bill.   .MDSD/.MDNM/\n.MDNM/\n","Headline":"\nHOUSE VOTES TO PREVENT POLICE FROM KEEPING DRUG MONEY \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The U.S. House tried Thursday to do what\nMissouri legislators and courts have not yet been able to do --\nprevent state and local police from keeping drug money that is\nsupposed to go somewhere else.  \n","\n   The House passed a bill that requires state and local police to\nfollow their own laws rather than federal laws when they seize drug\nmoney and property.  \n","\n   Many law enforcement agencies have not done that in Missouri.\nUnder state law, drug money seized by local police is supposed to\ngo through a state court, which usually sends it to public\neducation.
