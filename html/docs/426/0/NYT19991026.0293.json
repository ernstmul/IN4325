Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon announce sweeping new\nfederal rules to protect the privacy of billions of medical records\nand will assail Congress for failing to enact any safeguards,\nadministration officials said on Tuesday.\n\n   The proposed regulations would be the first comprehensive\nfederal standards specifically intended to protect the\nconfidentiality of medical records. They come at a time when\ndoctors, hospitals, pharmacists and health maintenance\norganizations are sharing more and more data, often without the\nknowledge of patients, and insurance companies are demanding more\ninformation to justify the payment of claims.\n\n   The proposals would cover any medical records that are kept or\ntransmitted electronically, as well as paper printouts of\nelectronic transactions. Patients would generally have a right to\nreview and copy their medical records, and to supplement the\nrecords or correct mistakes, administration officials said.\n\n   Most medical records are still kept on paper, but a growing\nnumber of health plans require doctors to submit claims\nelectronically. In practice, health care experts said, the proposed\nrules would set standards for all medical records because it is not\npractical for doctors and insurers to follow different policies for\nthe use and disclosure of personal medical information kept in\ndifferent forms.\n\n   Congress has been trying to write such protections into law, but\nthe effort has stalled. In 1996, Congress imposed a deadline on\nitself, requiring the secretary of health and human services to\nissue privacy rules if lawmakers failed to pass health privacy\nlegislation by Aug. 21, 1999. The administration's new proposals\ncarry out that requirement.\n\n   In offering the proposed rules, White House officials said,\nClinton will try to achieve three political purposes. He will put\npressure on Congress to pass legislation. He will present himself\nas a champion of privacy rights, a politically popular cause. And,\nby making aggressive use of his power, he will try to counter the\nperception of himself as a lame duck.\n\n   The president expressed impatience on Monday, when he criticized\nRepublicans for blocking his proposal to provide prescription drug\nbenefits under Medicare. In a fleeting reference to his next\ninitiative, Clinton said: ``Because they have not taken action to\nprotect the privacy of medical records, I will use the power of my\noffice to do that in the coming days. I think that's a very\nimportant issue.''\n\n   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White\nHouse, said: ``We would have preferred that Congress pass\nbipartisan legislation. They gave themselves three years to do it.\nBut in the absence of action on Capitol Hill, the president will\nact.''\n\n   The White House is still negotiating some details with law\nenforcemicials, who want to be sure the privacy rules do not\nhamper their investigations.\n\n   Federal officials are also analyzing the cost of the proposals.\nA recent study by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said\nthat compliance with such standards could cost tens of billions of\ndollars because health care providers, health plans and insurance\ncompanies would have to retrain employees, hire privacy experts,\nrewrite contracts and reprogram computers.\n\n   Administration officials are compiling data to show that those\ncost estimates are grossly exaggerated.\n\n   The proposed rules appear stricter than the comparable\nprovisions of a landmark bill hammered out last week to overhaul\nthe nation's financial system. Under that bill, divisions of a big\nfinancial conglomerate _ for example, an insurance company and a\nconsumer bank _ could share information about a customer under many\ncircumstances, and they would have to inform customers at least\nonce a year of their policies on privacy and disclosure.\n\n   Under the medical privacy rules, an insurer would also have to\ninform the subscriber of its privacy practices, but it would be\nmore difficult for the insurer to share health information with an\naffiliated company. In most cases, the insurer would have to get\nthe consumer's permission before allowing use of the information\nfor purposes unrelated to medical treatment or the payment of\nclaims.\n\n   The proposed rules will probably not go far enough to satisfy\npsychiatrists, but may go too far for some law enforcement\nofficials.\n\n   Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, vice president of the American\nPsychiatric Association, said: ``The administration's proposal\nwould protect notes taken by a therapist in the course of\npsychotherapy, and that's good. But it would take away some of the\npower that patients have traditionally had to decide when and if\ntheir records are released to third parties.''\n\n   In general, law enforcement agencies would need a search\nwarrant, a subpoena or some other legal authorization to get\nconfidential medical records. Federal, state and local law\nenforcement officials said they wanted to preserve their ability to\nget immediate access to medical information without a warrant in\nemergencies _ when they are investigating a bomb threat or trying\nto rescue hostages, for example.\n\n   John R. Justice, chairman of the National District Attorneys\nAssociation, said investigators often did not have enough time or\nspecific information to get a warrant for medical records in\n``exigent circumstances.'' For example, he said, the police may ask\nlocal hospitals to notify them if a fleeing suspect shows up for\ntreatment of a gunshot wound. And the police may want to know about\nthe health problems of a person who is holding hostages or being\nheld hostage.\n\n   The public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed\nrules. Under the 1996 law, the secretary of health and human\nservices must issue final rules by Feb. 21 of next year.\n\n   Experts on health privacy in and out of the government said the\nproposed rules also included these provisions:\n\n   _ Health care providers and HMO's would not have to get a\npatient's consent before disclosing information needed for medical\ntreatment or the payment of claims. But they would have to get the\npatient's consent if the information was to be used for marketing\nand certain types of research.\n\n   _ The federal rules would establish minimum protections for\npatients' privacy and would not override any contrary provisions of\nstate law that were ``more stringent'' than the federal\nrequirements. Many states provide more protection in specific areas\nlike mental health, genetic testing, AIDS or other sexually\ntransmitted diseases. These state laws would not be pre-empted by\nthe federal rules.\n\n   _ Before disclosing information, doctors would have to take\nreasonable steps to make sure they did not disclose more\ninformation than was actually needed to accomplish the purpose of\nthe request. The rules would forbid the wholesale release of entire\nrecords when a small part would suffice.\n\n   _ Doctors, hospitals and health plans could charge a reasonable\nfee to cover the cost of copying records.\n\n   Under federal law, doctors and hospitals can be fined up to\n$50,000 for the improper disclosure of confidential medical\ninformation, and they are subject to larger fines if they sell such\ndata for ``commercial advantage'' or ``malicious harm.'' Under the\nproposed rules, patients would not gain any new federal right to\nsue a doctor or an HMO for divulging medical records. Federal\nofficials said that only Congress could create a new right to sue.\n\n   The proposed rules would provide additional protection for some\nsensitive personal information in mental health records, but not as\nmuch protection as many psychiatrists want.\n\n   Under the proposal, a psychotherapist would not need a patient's\nconsent to disclose information about the diagnosis of a condition,\nthe patient's level of functioning or medications when such\ninformation was necessary for treatment or for the payment of\nclaims. But the therapist would have to get the patient's consent\nbefore disclosing more detailed information about a patient's\nfeelings, family relationships or sexual relationships.\n","Headline":"\nEXCLUSIVE: CLINTON TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF\nMEDICAL RECORDS\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon announce sweeping new\nfederal rules to protect the privacy of billions of medical records\nand will assail Congress for failing to enact any safeguards,\nadministration officials said on Tuesday.\n","\n   The proposed regulations would be the first comprehensive\nfederal standards specifically intended to protect the\nconfidentiality of medical records.
