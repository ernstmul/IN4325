This much-touted provision purports to improve\nthe lot of property owners, but that is open to question.  \n\n   Although the new law allows a judge to award attorney fees to a\nproperty owner who wins a forfeiture case, that right already was\navailable. For a decade, attorneys have won fees in forfeiture\ncases using existing federal laws.  \n\n   The new law could actually make it more difficult to win them.  \n\n   Under existing laws, attorneys only had to win their case. If\nthe government couldn't show its own case was ``substantially\njustified,'' the attorney got the fees.  \n\n   Under the new law, the government has to prove nothing, and the\nproperty owner must prove that he ``substantially prevailed.''  \n\n   The big question: How do you substantially prevail?  \n\n   ``What does that mean?'' asked Jimmy Gurule, a Notre Dame\nUniversity law professor and author of a book on forfeiture law.\n``You prevail or you don't.''  \n\n   Some, including Gurule and one assistant U.S. attorney, think\nthat standard will make it harder to win attorney fees under the\nnew law.  \n\n   But others think it may not even be necessary to win the case to\nsubstantially prevail. In fact, that was the intent of Congress,\nsaid Julie Katzman, an attorney with Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont\nDemocrat who co-sponsored the bill.  \n\n   It will probably require litigation to settle the issue, several\nsaid.  \n\n   One minor improvement: Existing attorney fee law would not award\nfees if a property owner's net worth was more than $2 million. The\nnew forfeiture law does not make that exception.  \n\n   -- Burden of proof. Many point to a shift in the burden of proof\nas the most significant change in the law. But the change will not\nbe dramatic.  \n\n   Under the old law, the government only had to prove it had\nprobable cause to seize property. If the owner wanted to fight the\nforfeiture, it was then up to him to prove by a ``preponderance of\nevidence '' that the property was not the proceeds of a crime.  \n\n   Now it's the government that must prove that the property was\nthe proceeds of crime by a preponderance of evidence.  \n\n   Experts point out that even though the burden has shifted to the\ngovernment, it won't make a lot of difference for several reasons.  \n\n   First, preponderance of evidence is the easiest standard to meet\nin a courtroom. To win, it requires only the ``slightest degree''\nmore evidence than the opponent, as one judge described it.  \n\n   (Some congressmen fought to require ``clear and convincing''\nevidence, but the standard was lowered during negotiations with the\nJustice Department.)  \n\n   Second, that's about as much evidence as law enforcement and\nprosecutors usually had under the old law.  \n\n   ``If you were a prosecutor, you knew you better have more\nevidence than the other side,'' said Brock Stephenson, an assistant\nU.S. attorney who handles forfeitures in the Dallas judicial\ndistrict.  \n\n   ``The change in standards makes the system feel fairer ... and\nthat perception of fairness is nothing to sneeze at,'' said Frank\nBowman, an associate law professor at Indiana\nUniversity-Indianapolis. ``But changing these particular words is\nof little more than symbolic importance.''  \n\n   He and others say where the preponderance burden will make all\nthe difference is when there is a tie _ the owner should win.  \n\n   But there's one important caveat that few have addressed\npublicly: The change in burden of proof only affects a fraction of\nforfeiture cases.  \n\n   That's because it will only come up when forfeiture cases go to\ntrial, and only 15 percent of all forfeiture cases are contested.  \n\n   True, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, using figures\nfrom the Justice and Treasury departments, the proportion of\ncontested cases will increase to 30 percent.  \n\n   But David Smith, a contributor to the bill and a forfeiture\nexpert for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in\nWashington, D.C., disputes that figure.  \n\n   ``I think that is ludicrous,'' said Smith, adding that he\nthought claims would only increase 5 percent. ``(Justice is)\nprobably painting a bleaker picture than really exists.''  \n\n   Indeed, the new law doesn't preclude federal agencies from still\ndeclaring property forfeited without the approval of a prosecutor\nor judge. That's called ``administrative forfeiture'' and it's used\nin the vast majority of cases.  \n\n   And the new law still does not require a person to be convicted\nof a crime to have property forfeited. Under the old law, few\nowners who had property forfeited were even charged with a crime,\nmuch less convicted.  \n\n   -- Cost bond. Under the old law, a property owner who wished to\ncontest the forfeiture in court had to file a claim of ownership\nwith the seizing agency and pay a cost bond of $250 to $5,000.  \n\n   The cost bond became one of the most hotly contested provisions\nin the new law. Law enforcement said it was needed to filter out\nfrivolous claims.  \n\n   When the dust settled, the cost bond had turned into a fine\nthat's imposed when a judge finds that a claim is frivolous. That's\nan improvement that could allow more people into court, experts\nsay, but it's not without risk.  \n\n   Property owners don't have to pay the money up front, but they\ncould face a fine at the end.  \n\n   If a judge determines a claim is frivolous, the owner can be\nsubject to a fine of $250 to $5,000, much like the old cost bond.  \n\n   One other concern: The law now requires a person to provide\ndocumentation when possible that the property belongs to him.  \n\n   Even so, some law enforcement officials still worry that the new\nlaw could lead to a flood of frivolous claims.  \n\n   Smith, who strongly supports the new law, said he thinks the\nDrug Enforcement Administration will try to prevent people who do\nnot have documentation for property from filing claims.  \n\n   ``We all know that is going to be manipulated by the DEA to deny\npeople their right to go to court,'' said Smith, who expects that\nproblem to be worked out in litigation.  \n\n   -- Attorney representation. Another provision that has been\ntrumpeted provides an attorney for poor persons in a forfeiture\ncase.  \n\n   But that happens only in two areas.  \n\n   A judge must appoint an attorney for an indigent whose home is\nbeing forfeited. If an indigent already has an attorney in a\nrelated criminal case, the judge may appoint one for the forfeiture\ncase.  \n\n   Otherwise, if police seize cash, cars or property other than a\nhome and there is no criminal case, legal expenses can cost up to\n$20,000, defense lawyers have said.  \n\n   Other provisions make such changes as:  \n\n   _ Setting a time limit for the government to file a forfeiture\ncomplaint while lengthening the time the government can take to\nnotify interested parties.  \n\n   _ Clarifying the ability of a person to prove he is the innocent\nowner of seized property so he can recover it.  \n\n   _ Under certain circumstances, allowing owners to keep property\n(not cash) during forfeiture proceedings if loss of the property\npresents a hardship, such as not being able to work.  \n\n   It's difficult to know what all the key players who put together\nthe bill think about the result _ some now prefer not to talk about\nit.  \n\n   The offices of Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who\nbacked a House version of the bill, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah\nRepublican who co-sponsored the Senate bill, for the past two\nmonths did not return phone calls or written questions.  \n\n   And the Justice Department, which successfully fought to weaken\nthe bill, did not respond to questions or phone calls about it.  \n\n   But many experts say the bill has one key flaw: It will not\nsubstantially cut into revenue from forfeitures.  \n\n   Steven Kessler, a defense attorney and former Bronx, N.Y.,\nprosecutor who has written a 900-page book on forfeiture law,\npoints out that the law was long overdue but that it doesn't go to\nthe heart of the problem.  \n\n   ``I'm sorry it doesn't take the profit motive out of law\nenforcement,'' Kessler said. ``If that motive were taken out then I\nthink we would have forfeiture the way it was supposed to be.''\n","Headline":"\nNEWLY ENACTED FORFEITURE REFORM LAW FALLS SHORT, CRITICS SAY \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Congress passed a forfeiture reform bill last\nmonth with great fanfare, promising it would finally protect civil\nliberties and property rights.  \n","\n   Critics said the new law didn't go far enough, but at least it\nwas an important first step.  \n","\n   A closer look shows the law might not even be that significant.  \n","\n   Indeed, the bill makes some progress, and any progress is\nnoteworthy in the stubborn area of federal forfeitures, almost\neveryone agrees.  \n","\n   But when they examine the bill's provisions, many experts now\nfind that the new law is constructed with back doors and false\nfronts that will preclude major change.  \n","\n   ``It's pretty minimal,'' said Eric Blumenson, a law professor at\nSuffolk University and author of ``Policing for Profit.''  \n","\n   ``It certainly doesn't change the flow of assets into the\nagencies that seize them.''  \n","\n   The Kansas City Star interviewed a dozen law enforcement\nofficials, attorneys and legal experts, including two who helped\nwrite the bill, to determine what it does and does not do.  \n","\n   An analysis of key reforms in the bill:  \n","\n   -- Attorney fees.
