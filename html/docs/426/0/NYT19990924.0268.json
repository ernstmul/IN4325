(af)  \n By REBECCA M. KNIGHT   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Do you have pangs of guilt whenever you leave Rover to fend for\nhimself all day? Take heart. Dog day-care centers, where dogs are\nleft while their owners run errands, head to the office or simply\nclean house, are popping up all over.\n\n   The American Board and Kennel Association estimates that of the\nmore than 8,500 kennels nationwide, 500 specialize in day care. And\nthat care often provides far more than a cage, a bowl of chow and a\nrubber ball: The centers may offer an array of amenities, from\nmassages and baths to swimming lessons, off-leash exercise, even\npedicures.\n\n   ``In today's world, we tend to think of our pets as our\nchildren,'' said Dr. Kay Cox, an animal psychologist in Phoenix.\n``Leaving your dog alone for the day is just like leaving a small\nchild alone; dogs and children need socialization and\ninteraction.''\n\n   Penelope Wong of Oakland, Calif., chief executive of an\nadvertising agency in San Francisco, happily acknowledges spoiling\nWabbi, her 9-month-old soft-coated wheaton terrier. Wabbi is\nenrolled at K9 to 5, an upscale center in San Francisco.\n\n   Dog day-care, Ms. Wong said, ``is good for the mental health of\nthe dog because it's incredibly lonely for a puppy to be left alone\nall day.''\n\n   K9 to 5, which offers training, grooming and walking, is so\npopular that the waiting list is more than nine months.\n\n   Most clients come from upper-middle-class, single-dog\nhouseholds. ``Our customers are mostly professionals with no\nchildren,'' said Marc Helsing, owner of Downtown Dogs' Daycare in\nSan Jose, Calif.\n\n   Dog day-care is growing in popularity, he added, because of\nAmericans' changing work habits. ``People don't work a standard\n9-to-5 shift anymore,'' he said. ``They are out of the house more\noften, and sometimes they're too tired to take their dog for a walk\nwhen they come home from the office.''\n\n   Gary Kercher, owner of Yuppy Puppy in Troy, Ohio, said, ``Dog\nday-care is a place where dogs can play ball, go for a walk and\nbuild relationships with other dogs, just like a regular kids' day\ncare.''\n\n   Some veterinarians aren't as enthusiastic. Dr. Charles Myer of\nthe Dog and Cat Clinic in Leavenworth, Kan., is not convinced that\ndogs need such pampering. ``It's certainly not for the dog's\nbenefit,'' he said. ``It's more for the psyche of the owner.''\n\n   But many dog owners swear by it. Ona Wigginton, membership\ncoordinator at the Denver Museum of Natural History, brings her\nminiature dachshund, Heidi, to Big Back Yard, a dog day-care center\nin Denver. ``Heidi gets right in the car and knows where she's\ngoing in the morning,'' Ms. Wigginton said. ``She usually needs a\ncouple of days' rest after being there; she just plays all day\nlong.''\n\n   Americans are spending more than ever on their pets _ $7 billion\nalone on veterinary expenses. Thirty-eight percent of Americans own\ndogs, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, and in\n1998, dog owners spent nearly $300 a year, on average, on their\npets, not including $500 in veterinarian bills.\n\n   Dog day-care may not be for the thin of wallet: A single visit\nto K9 to 5 can cost up to $40. Grooming and one-on-one interaction\nwith a trained specialist cost more.\n\n   To put the figures in perspective, a massage for humans at a\nreputable day spa in New York City costs about $80 an hour; at the\nNew York Dog Spa and Hotel, an upscale dog day-care business in the\nChelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, a massage is $60 an hour. A\npedicure for humans at a beauty salon runs about $30; one for the\ndog is $15, polish optional.\n\n   ``It can get real fancy,'' said Kercher, whose Ohio center also\noffers nail care. ``We have 28 colors to choose from.''\n\n   Many centers have a grueling admissions process. Downtown Dogs'\nDaycare, for example, requires owners to complete a three-page\nquestionnaire about their dog's medical and behavioral history.\n\n   The questionnaire serves as a character sketch that details\neverything from the dog's known commands to its fears. The next\nstep is a meeting at which the dog is tested for his reaction to\nother dogs of varying temperaments. In fact, dogs have been\nexpelled from day care for fighting and other disruptive behavior.\n\n   ``We have had several dogs removed from the program,'' Helsing\nsaid in a regretful tone. ``Some dogs just aren't a good fit,\nunfortunately.''\n","Headline":"\nGIVING MORE CARE TO A DOG'S LIFE  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 26) \n","Text":["\n   Do you have pangs of guilt whenever you leave Rover to fend for\nhimself all day?
