(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By DAVID ARMSTRONG  \n c.1997 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Enforcement of the nation's environmental laws is\noften haphazard and lax, creating a system where major polluters\ncan operate with little fear of being caught or punished, according\nto court and enforcement records.\n\n   While the Clinton administration has promoted the notion of an\nenvironment-friendly presidency, and federal agencies have\ntrumpeted record-breaking fines against polluters, some enforcement\nofficials on the front line say they are losing the battle.\n\n   ``The Clinton people have gutted environmental enforcement,''\nsaid Gregory Sasse, a federal prosecutor in Cleveland with 13 years\nof experience pursuing polluters. ``It is not a priority.''\n\n   Larger companies, particularly those with political muscle, are\noften treated differently than smaller businesses that lack legal\nresources and clout, according to some prosecutors and\nenvironmental watchdogs.\n\n   Environmental enforcement in the United States is so uneven that\nwhether or not a company or individual is prosecuted by the federal\ngovernment for polluting is largely a factor of where it does\nbusiness, according to an analysis of seven years of records for\nevery federal court district in the country.\n\n   In eastern North Carolina, for instance, the US attorney did not\nprosecute a single company or person for an environmental offense\nfrom 1992 through 1998, the last year for which records are\navailable. Federal prosecutors in Maryland, by comparison,\nprosecuted 42 environmental cases in 1998 alone.\n\n   Massachusetts has among the most anemic enforcement records in\nthe country, according to federal criminal prosecution data and\ninternal records of the Environmental Protection Agency. In\naddition, records indicate that John DeVillars, the EPA\nadministrator for New England, has become personally involved in\ncases where members of Congress or their staff have lobbied the\nagency to soften enforcement action against corporate polluters.\n\n   In at least two cases, the New England EPA appears to have\nviolated agency rules designed to prevent the appearance of\nfavoritism in enforcement cases. The regional agency has also\nembraced a national movement to combine enforcement with\n``compliance assistance,'' a program whereby it tells companies\nwhat they should be doing and allows them to voluntarily fix\npollution problems to avoid penalties.\n\n   It is a controversial approach that critics say coddles\npolluters and sends a message that enforcing environmental laws is\nnot a priority. In addition, businesses can reap the economic\nbenefits of polluting for many years, and not have to pay a price\nfor breaking the law in the past.\n\n   DeVillars and top officials in the Clinton administration,\nhowever, say the new approach results in more businesses improving\ntheir environmental performance. In addition, they say compliance\nassistance is not replacing traditional enforcement, but is being\noffered in concert with tough sanctions.\n\n   ``We have heard criticism from those who believe compliance\nassistance is tantamount to not enforcing. I think that is a false\ncriticism,'' said Sylvia Lowrance, the EPA's deputy assistant\nadministrator for enforcement. ``Our view is a strong enforcement\nbase is absolutely essential. What incentive is there if you don't\nhave the deterrent backup of a strong enforcement program?''\n\n   Corporate America, however, appears unconvinced that the\ngovernment is taking a tough line on enforcement.\n\n   One of the country's largest environmental consulting companies,\nthe International Technology Corporation of Pennsylvania, said\ngovernment enforcement of environmental laws is so lax that the\nfirm's business is being hurt.\n\n   ``Demand for the company's services is heavily influenced by the\nlevel of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations,''\naccording to the company's 1997 annual report. ``During the 1990s,\nspending by commercial clients has slowed primarily due to reduced\nimplementation and enforcement activities by governmental\nregulatory authorities.''\n\n   In its 1998 annual report, the company again cited weakening\nenforcement by federal, state, and local regulators. Environmental\ndecisions by private industry in the United States, the company\nsaid, are now driven by economic concerns and not regulatory or\nlegal ones.\n\n   When it comes to policing the country's polluters, the\nenvironmental cop is not walking the beat, said Michael Casey of\nthe Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization in\nWashington that studies environmental enforcement data.\n\n   ``The lesson here is if you are a big, politically-connected\npolluter, you can endanger public safety and health with\nimpunity,'' he said. ``Environmental crime pays.''\n\n     \n  \n\n   EPA disregards key law\n\n     \n  \n\n   When discussing its environmental record, the White House points\nto a three-page-long list of accomplishments _ from a $1.5 billion\nplan to restore the Florida Everglades to the approval of tougher\nclean-air standards.\n\n   Yet even when highlighting its achievements in a White House\npaper called ``Protecting our Environment and Public Health,'' the\nClinton administration strikes a cautionary note:\n\n   ``A third of us still breathe unhealthy air, and 40 percent of\nour waterways are still too polluted for fishing and swimming.\nDevelopment threatens open space and environmentally sensitive\nlands, and global warming threatens the stability of the earth's\nclimate.''\n\n   The EPA's own report of enforcement efforts last year highlights\nthe continuing disregard of several key environmental laws. The\nagency reported that:\n\n   --Approximately 20 percent of the nation's incinerators and\nlandfills are in significant noncompliance with hazardous waste\nlaws.\n\n   --One in four drinking water systems in the nation is in\nviolation of public health standards.\n\n   --Half of the country's wastewater treatment facilities failed\nto comply with clean-water laws during at least one-quarter of\nfiscal 1998.\n\n   The passage of a battery of environmental laws in the past 30\nyears was supposed to solve many of those problems. However, many\nof the laws are not being aggressively enforced.\n\n   The Clean Water Act was a seminal ecological event when it was\npassed by Congress in 1972. Yet today, according to environmental\ngroups and internal EPA records, the enforcement of the law is so\nweak that many serious and chronic polluters operate with virtual\nimpunity.\n\n   One indicator of the sorry state of the country's water supply\nis the explosive growth of the bottled-water industry. Bottled\nwater sales in the United States rose 9.5 percent last year from\nthe previous year, according to the Beverage Marketing Corp. The\nindustry cites the fear of contaminants in water supplies as a\ndriving force in growing sales.\n\n   The EPA's Inspector General last year found that enforcement\nstaff in Alaska and Idaho failed to take any action against 75\npercent of the companies that were in significant noncompliance\nwith the Clean Water Act. The polluters ranged from the US Army to\na major seafood processor. The pollutants included excess amounts\nof nitrogen, ammonia, oil, grease, and chlorine.\n\n   Nationwide, many serious and chronic violators are escaping\nenforcement, and even those who are punished often receive only a\nslap on the wrist, according to the Public Interest Research Group,\nan environmental activist organization.\n\n   In a 1997 study of water enforcement, PIRG concluded that one of\nevery five major wastewater discharges violated the Clean Water Act\nduring a 15-month period. The group is updating its study, and a\npreliminary analysis has indicated little change.\n\n   Those who pollute the air also benefit from lax enforcement of\nthe Clean Air Act, which was created in 1962 and toughened in 1990,\naccording to both the EPA's Inspector General and analysis of EPA\nenforcement records.\n\n   As it does with many enforcement programs, the EPA often pays\nstates to enforce the Clean Air Act. But both the agency and the\nstates have failed to do the job effectively, the EPA Inspector\nGeneral concluded last year.\n\n   ``We found inconsistent implementation of agency directives, and\nin other cases the states or EPA regions disregarded the agency's\nrequirements,'' the report stated. ``As a result, the effectiveness\nof air-enforcement programs suffered. Numerous significant air\npollution violators went undetected and many of those identified\nwere not reported to EPA. Moreover, these violators were not made\nknown to the public.''\n\n   The Inspector General reviewed enforcement actions in six\nstates, including Massachusetts, and found widespread failure to\ndetect major air polluters.\n\n   A study this year by the Environmental Working Group made\nsimilar conclusions: ``Without question, the Clean Air Act is not\nbeing effectively enforced.''\n\n   The group analyzed the EPA's enforcement record and found that\none of every three major facilities in auto assembly, iron and\nsteel, petroleum refining, pulp manufacturing, and metal smetling\nviolated the Clean Air Act in 1997 or 1998.\n\n   Yet only a third of those violating the law were fined and the\nfines that were levied were too small to have any effect, the group\nsaid.\n\n   ``Unless there is a strong threat of enforcement, people will\nbreak the law,'' said John Coequyt, who oversaw the study.\n\n   The EPA and Justice Department said action it took against 24\nelectric utility companies earlier this month is proof the Clinton\nadministration is serious about cracking down on air polluters.\n\n   The government filed seven lawsuits in the south and midwest,\naccusing the companies of illegally releasing massive amounts of\nair pollutants and contributing to one of the most severe\nenvironmental problems facing the country.
