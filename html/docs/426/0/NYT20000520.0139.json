For that reason, they have passed laws\nblocking seized property from going directly back to police, and\nmany states designate seizures to be used for other purposes, such\nas education.  \n\n   But a yearlong examination by The Kansas City Star reveals that\npolice agencies in every one of more than two dozen states checked\nby the newspaper have used federal law enforcement to circumvent\ntheir own laws and keep more of that money for themselves.  \n\n   It works this way: When police seize money, they call a federal\nagency instead of going to state court to confiscate it. An agency\nsuch as the Drug Enforcement Administration accepts the seizure,\nmaking it a federal case. The DEA keeps a cut of the money and\nreturns the rest to police. State courts are bypassed altogether.  \n\n   Law enforcement says that's not illegal and that without the\nmoney, police would be handcuffed in fighting crime. But millions\nof dollars that lawmakers in some states have designated for\neducation, drug treatment programs and other purposes instead end\nup back in the hands of police.  \n\n   For example:  \n\n   -- A North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper stopped a\ndriver last year on Interstate 95 for tailgating. A police dog\nsignaled drugs were in the Toyota, where troopers found $105,700\nand two grams of marijuana. The driver denied owning either the\ndrugs or the money. The highway patrol gave it to the DEA, which\nreturned more than $80,000 to the state patrol, even though North\nCarolina law generally requires sending seized money to education.  \n\n   -- In June a Georgia trooper stopped a 1996 Monte Carlo for\nspeeding on I-95. After the driver and passengers gave conflicting\nstories, the trooper searched the car and found a hidden\ncompartment containing $7,000, which the driver said was from\nsavings.  \n\n   The patrol turned over the money to the DEA, which in January\nreturned $5,440 to the patrol. Under Georgia law forfeited money\nshould go to the state's general fund.  \n\n   -- In 1996, the Missouri Highway Patrol stopped a Volkswagen\nGolf for speeding, searched it because the occupants seemed\nsuspicious and found $24,000. No drugs were found and no one\nclaimed the money. The patrol gave it to the DEA to be forfeited,\nthe legal term for confiscation.  \n\n   (The Volkswagen case took a bizarre turn last year when a family\nthat bought the car at auction discovered an additional $82,000 in\nthe gas tank. The DEA took that money, too.)  \n\n   Missouri law sends forfeited money to a public education fund.  \n\n   Beyond the money diverted from public funds, critics are just as\ntroubled by the weakening of a basic American civil liberty _ the\nBill of Rights protection against improper search and seizure.  \n\n   Owners who want to recover seized property usually face a much\ntougher road in federal court than they would under their own state\nlaws. That continues despite a federal law passed last month that\nwill place some limits on forfeiture.  \n\n   It's no accident that many state laws have stronger civil\nprotections than federal law, legislators say.  \n\n   ``We have tried to make sure that people who are subject to\nforfeitures have some basic rights,'' said Georgia Rep. Jim Martin,\na Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  \n\n   The federal hand-offs, critics say, also create an opportunity\nfor police to profit from their own actions. Indeed, they trace an\nincreasing outcry over aggressive or illegal searches by police\nnationwide back to the profit motive.  \n\n   ``If you think that by conducting an illegal search and seizing\npeople on the highway you can increase the number of times where\nyou can take assets, it is going to become a big motivating\nforce,'' said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil\nLiberties Union.  \n\n   This may be one of those rare issues that elicits protests\nacross the political spectrum _ from the ACLU to the National Rifle\nAssociation.  \n\n   Americans don't realize that forfeitures often occur to\n``ordinary people who happen to find themselves in a situation in\nwhich they are simply suspected of having been somehow involved in\ncriminal activity, whether those suspicions ever prove out or\nnot,'' said Roger Pilon, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a\nLibertarian think tank.  \n\n   ``The line between a free society and a police state is usually\nbroached in small steps.''  \n\n   Not every police department turns seizure money over to federal\nagencies, but many that do complain that state laws are too\nrestrictive.  \n\n   Sometimes, police explain, they believe money they seize is\nlinked to drugs, but they can't prove it under state standards, and\nthey don't want to give the money back to a suspected drug dealer.\nFederal law lets them take the money out of the owner's hands.  \n\n   ``Everybody uses the federal system,'' said Lt. Harry Kearley of\nthe Alabama Bureau of Investigations.  \n\n   Federal officials agree police have the proper motives for using\nfederal law.  \n\n   ``I don't think police agencies are in the business of\nprofiting,'' said Jerry McDowell, director of the Justice\nDepartment's asset forfeiture and money laundering division.  \n\n   Besides, he said, it's legal for police to send seizures to\nfederal agencies because most state laws do not specifically\nprohibit that.  \n\n   ``We certainly don't want to subvert state law, and we don't\nwant states to subvert our law,'' McDowell said.  \n\n   But, in fact, most states do prohibit simply handing off\nseizures _ their laws give jurisdiction over seizures to state\ncourts, The Star has found.  \n\n   What that means, say legal experts who have examined the\nlittle-known state provisions, is that police cannot simply hand\noff seizures to federal agents to avoid state requirements. They\nneed a court order first.  \n\n   ``This statute is not difficult at all,'' said David Harris, a\nUniversity of Toledo law professor and constitutional expert. ``The\nstate court has jurisdiction.''  \n\n   A half-dozen state and federal court decisions have backed that\ninterpretation.  \n\n   ``A local police department may not take seized property and\njust pass it on as it pleases to the FBI in flagrant disregard of\nstate laws,'' according to a federal circuit court opinion in an\nIllinois case.  \n\n   Such handoffs began after Congress passed a 1984 law that\nallowed law enforcement to share forfeitures as a way to foster\ngreater cooperation and shut down drug operations.  \n\n   ``The intent was to permit the feds to share with state and\nlocal law enforcement when there were truly federal cases,'' former\nU.S. Rep. William J. Hughes, the chief sponsor of the bill and a\nNew Jersey Democrat, said in a recent interview.  \n\n   But the Justice Department wrote guidelines that have twisted\nthe intent of the law, critics say. In addition to addressing joint\ninvestigations led by federal agencies, the guidelines created a\nprocess called ``adoption.''  \n\n   Under adoption, state and local police could give their seizures\nto the federal government _ even if a federal agency had not been\ninvolved.  \n\n   The Justice Department ``turned around and permitted the\nforfeiture laws to be used basically to circumvent state law,''\nHughes said.  \n\n   Forfeitures have come to mean a lot of money for police.  \n\n   The Justice Department says that from October 1996 through March\n1999 it accepted $208,454,000 in seizures from state and local\npolice.  \n\n   But that figure is still being audited because the Justice\nDepartment has not published an annual forfeiture report since\n1996, although the law requires the report to be produced each\nyear.  \n\n   In fact, the $208 million figure is almost certainly low.  \n\n   Over one period, the Justice Department reported that Missouri\npolice gave federal agencies only half as much as the state auditor\nfound in just a sampling of adoptive cases.  \n\n   Whatever the nationwide total, forfeitures can quickly add up\nfor individual departments.  \n\n   In a single case in Indiana, a state trooper stopped a truck for\nspeeding on Interstate 70. Troopers found $811,470 and turned it\nover to the DEA, which this year returned almost $500,000 to the\nstate police and $121,000 to a sheriff's department that helped.  \n\n   Police say they need the money if they are to continue the war\non drugs. If they lose forfeiture money, they say, local\ngovernments are unlikely to replace it.  \n\n   For example, Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the special\ninvestigations unit for Albuquerque, N.M., police, pointed out that\nhis unit costs about $1 million a year, of which the city only\nfunds about $250,000.  \n\n   But critics say police who use forfeits to fund themselves end\nup on a treadmill.  \n\n   ``The real narcotic here is the money,'' said Glasser of the\nACLU. ``It becomes a stream of income that they learn not to do\nwithout and then they have to generate more of it.''  \n","Headline":"\nPOLICE ACROSS COUNTRY EVADE LAWS TO KEEP CONFISCATED PROPERTY \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police and highway patrols across the country\nare evading state laws to improperly keep millions of dollars in\ncash and property seized in drug busts and traffic stops.  \n","\n   Most states don't want law enforcement agencies to profit so\neasily from such confiscations _ they see it as a dangerous\nconflict of interest.
