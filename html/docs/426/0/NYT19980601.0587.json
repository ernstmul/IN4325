Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Broadening their efforts to limit what they see as\ndangerous congestion on New York City's sidewalks, city officials\nsaid Monday that their vending ban would include not only food\ncarts but also street sales of books, baseball cards, art, T-shirts\nand all other goods.\n\n   The ambitious enforcement plan targets yet another signature of\nthe Manhattan streetscape and potentially courts a First Amendment\nbattle, according to opponents of the restrictions. The widening of\nthe ban also gives food vendors a host of potential new allies as\nthey seek to build opposition to the rules by staging a citywide\nshutdown of the carts on Wednesday.\n\n   The new restrictions, to be enforced by the police beginning in\nabout mid-July, cover 144 blocks of Manhattan, including much of\nthe financial district and several stretches of midtown. In the\npast, the city has designated some areas where food vending was\nprohibited and others where vending of general merchandise like\nclothing was banned. Peddlers of books and other printed matter\nwere accorded the widest latitude because of their First Amendment\nrights.\n\n   But Earl Andrews Jr., chairman of the city's Sidewalk Vendor\nReview Panel, which approved the 144-block ban, said the\nrestrictions approved by the panel applied to vendors of both food\nand general merchandise, and thus covered artists and those who\nsell printed matter.\n\n   ``If a street is congested, it's going to be congested, whether\nit's a food vendor or a general vendor,'' said Andrews, who is\ncommissioner of the Department of Business Services. ``All vending\nshould exist in an area where there is no congestion and no threat\nto the safety of the citizens and the flow of traffic.''\n\n   Street artists, who have been persistent critics of Mayor\nRudolph Giuliani, said they would join the food vendors in a\ndemonstration that is to begin at 9 a.m. Wednesday in City Hall\nPark, to be followed with a lunchtime march to Wall Street and\nback.\n\n   Robert Lederman, president of Artists' Response to Illegal State\nTactics, said the wider ban would mean that ``fundamental elements\nof free speech and alternative expression'' would be ``the next\ncasualty in the mayor's quality of life campaign.''\n\n   ``This is not just about hot dogs,'' Lederman said. ``Mayor\nGiuliani's war on vendors is virtually eliminating free expression\nfrom large areas of New York City's public streets.''\n\n   Gabriel Taussig, the chief of the administrative law division of\nthe city's Law Department, said peddlers of books and other printed\nmatter, including collectors' cards, were exempt from city\nregulations requiring vendors to be licensed. But he said the city\nwas allowed to place limits on their displays _ for instance, how\nmuch space they take up on a sidewalk and their proximity to a\nsubway entrance. Under the same rationale, he said, the city could\nlimit the streets on which the vendors could set up.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   In the case of street artists, Taussig said that under a 1996\ndecision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the artists have\nthe same rights as book vendors. ``The legal principle is that we\nhave to give the greatest deference to vendors engaged in First\nAmendment activity,'' Taussig said. The standard has been that book\nvendors were disallowed in places where both food and\ngeneral-merchandise vendors were prohibited.\n\n   The administration officials were elaborating on comments that\nGiuliani had made at a news conference earlier Monday, when he had\nseemed to doubt whether the city could impose the same restrictions\non book merchants that it would impose on food carts. Asked whether\nthe regulations would also apply to book vendors, the mayor said:\n``The rules apply to food vendors. The rules with regard to book\nvendors are different because of their additional First Amendment\nprotection.''\n\n   City Councilman Anthony Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat who has\ncalled for the abolition of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, said\nthe broad enforcement was ``intellectually consistent'' on the part\nof the administration but that it put Giuliani in a potential\n``legal thicket.'' Wiener charged that the review panel's decisions\nwere arbitrary and were targeted in many cases at neighborhoods\nwhere ``sophisticated lobbying'' resulted in vendor bans.\n\n   ``The result is a process built more on politics than on public\nsafety,'' Weiner said. ``Although courts may allow that when it\ncomes to buying a hot dog, they can be expected to have a higher\nstandard when it comes to the First Amendment.''\n\n   Andrews, the chairman of the Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, said\nthe official list of vending restrictions would be published by the\ncity in two to three weeks. Enforcement is to begin 30 days after\nthat. He said many areas would remain open to vending, and asserted\nthat the availability of goods ``is not going to drastically change\nat all.''\n\n   ``Vendors are a part of the fabric of New York,'' Andrews said.\n``We are not trying to stop vending. We are only regulating it.''\n\n   On June 17, the vendor review panel will begin reviewing a\nsecond round of petitions for more bans on vending.
