SCOTT   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   I'll say this much for Skip, the antic terrier whose adventures\nare the subject of Jay Russell's new movie: He does not use a\ncomputer-animated mouth to recite cute catch phrases. He is not\naffiliated with a videogame, a line of action figures or a\nfast-food marketing campaign. He is not a Pokemon. This may be\nenough to recommend him to parents recovering from a holiday season\nspent with Buzz Lightyear, Pikachu and the chirpy, high-tech Stuart\nLittle.\n\n   Just as Skip is an old-fashioned, flesh-and-blood dog, ``My Dog\nSkip'' is a resolutely old-fashioned movie: a relaxed, modest\nevocation of the mythology of small-town mid-20th-century American\nchildhood, with its lazy summers, its front porches and picket\nfences, and its fat-tired, chromed-plated bicycles. The mementos we\nsee during the opening credits are emblems of childhood in an\nearlier, simpler time: a slingshot, a jar of marbles, a battered\ncopy of ``Huckleberry Finn,'' a football signed by Sammy Baugh.\nSee, parents will say to their children, this is how it was before\ntelevision, before Ritalin, before Doom. There were no play dates\nback then, just play.\n\n   ``My Dog Skip,'' set in a small Mississippi town during World\nWar II, is shot through with nostalgia for the lost innocence of\nchildhood and full of rumination (thanks to Harry Connick Jr.'s\nraspy-throated voice-over) about the deep wisdom a dog can impart\nto a boy. Since children seldom regard themselves as innocent, and\nsince they are incapable of nostalgia for a time of life they have\nyet to see slip away, they may find themselves mystified and a\nlittle bored by a movie designed to leave their adult companions\nmisty-eyed.\n\n   But the younger ones will at least be amused by Skip's charming\npet tricks: He drives the family car, cadges bologna from the\nbutcher and tries to enlist in the Army.\n\n   Older children, meanwhile, will sympathize with Skip's young\nmaster as he grapples with the irrationality of adults, the cruelty\nof his peers and the advent of puppy love in both its literal and\nits metaphorical incarnations. Some, of course, may wonder just\nwhat was so innocent about a time of strict racial segregation,\nwhen grown black men addressed 9-year-old boys _ and their dogs _\nas ``sir.''\n\n   ``My Dog Skip'' is based on Willie Morris' slender anecdotal\nmemoir of his carefree youth in Yazoo City, ``an unhurried,\nisolated place'' on the edge of the Mississippi Delta. Morris' wry,\ninconsequential vignettes _ about spending the night in the town\ncemetery, about Skip's performances in backyard football games _\nhave been threaded together into a narrative bustling with\ncomplication and laden with emotion, and a great deal has been\ninvented outright.\n\n   Willie has been given a next-door neighbor named Dink Jenkins\n(Luke Wilson), who leaves for the service a hometown sports hero\nand returns home in disgrace, dogged by rumors of overseas\ncowardice. Willie's father, Jack (Kevin Bacon), himself an\nembittered war veteran _ he lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War _\nis at once remote and overprotective. When Willie receives Skip as\na birthday present, Jack threatens, for reasons that are not\nterribly clear or convincing, to send the poor pooch away. But\nSkip's frolicsome good nature is enough to melt the stoniest heart,\nand Jack and Willie learn important lessons about love, loyalty and\nthe bonds between father and son.\n\n   None of this is in the book, but Russell and his screenwriter,\nGail Gilchriest, clearly felt they needed more drama than Morris'\nleisurely narrative could supply.\n\n   Bacon, stoically disregarding the wild implausibility of his\ncharacter's past, delivers a beautifully understated performance,\nas does Diane Lane, who plays Willie's mother, Ellen. As Willie,\nthe squinchy-faced Frankie Muniz _ who may become the first child\nmedia sensation of the new century, thanks to his starring role in\nthe new Fox television series ``Malcolm in the Middle'' _ is nearly\nas irresistible as Skip, who is impersonated by no fewer than six\neminently capable Jack Russell terriers. Caitlin Wachs is witty and\nappealing as Rivers Applewhite, a sympathetic Becky Thatcher to\nWillie's tame Tom Sawyer.\n\n   These performances, and the lovely Mississippi locations (the\nfilm was shot in picturesque Canton, just up the road from Yazoo\nCity, which has apparently grown too big and too modern to pass for\nits old self), help to make the film's relentless sentimentality\nmore bearable than it otherwise might have been.\n\n   ``My Dog Skip'' works best when it sticks with the gentle humor\nand pathos of its literary source. But the filmmakers are prone, as\nthe adult Morris rarely was, to moralizing overstatement.\nEverything that happens to young Willie becomes a rite of passage,\nand the stages of his life are measured in absurdly precise\nincrements: His adult voice informs us when he completes the\ntransit from child to boy, and then from boy to young man. (Morris'\nlater life included a scholarship to Oxford University, the\neditorship of Harper's magazine and a distinguished career as\nwriter, raconteur and colorful local character.)\n\n   At one point the voice-over, needlessly embellishing Morris'\nprose, tells us that Skip seemed ``possessed of a wisdom as old as\ntime itself.'' This seems more than a bit hyperbolic, given that it\ndescribes a creature whose greatest ambition is to reach the toilet\nbowl and who chases his tail when commanded to play dead.\n\n   PRODUCTION NOTES:\n\n   `MY DOG SKIP'\n\n   Directed by Jay Russell; written by Gail Gilchriest, based on\nthe book by Willie Morris; director of photography, James L.\nCarter; edited by Harvey Rosenstock and Gary Winter; music by\nWilliam Ross; production designer, David J.
