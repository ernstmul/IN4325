As of last\nyear, French law requires that all breeds considered dangerous must\nbe chained or kept on a leash. They also must be registered. Pit\nbulls must be sterilized or neutered. It is against the law to\nbreed pit bull dogs in France.\n\n   Closer to home, a 71-year-old Census Bureau worker was attacked\nand killed by a pack of dogs when she attempted to count the\noccupants of an isolated rural home near Nashville, Ind.\n\n   Sheriff's deputies counted more than 20 dogs. Some were still\nchewing on the dead woman's arms and legs when authorities arrived.\n\n   The census taker ignored signs posted on the property's driveway\nthat said ``Beware of Dog'' and ``No Trespassing.''\n\n   The owner of the home where the attack took place claimed that\nthe dogs were a pack of strays. Authorities aren't so sure about\nthat.\n\n   The news story did not mention the breed of the dogs that\nattacked the Census Bureau worker. A lot of Americans agree with\nFrench lawmakers that certain dog breeds pose a greater risk to\nhumans than other breeds.\n\n   I'm no expert, but it's my experience that some dog breeds are\nnaturally meaner than other breeds. A responsible and knowledgeable\npet owner probably can train and socialize nearly any dog so it is\nunlikely to attack people or animals.\n\n   Unlikely does not mean never.\n\n   Years ago, Austin residents were embroiled in a public argument\nover a proposed vicious dog ordinance. A young man who opposed a\nbreed-specific ordinance was an eloquent defender of American\nStaffordshire Terriers, a breed that looks indistinguishable from\npit bull terriers. Breeders claim there are significant\ndifferences, but the dogs all come from the same common stock.\n\n   He made the argument that it was unfair to pick on certain\nbreeds because responsible pet owners can raise gentle and loving\npets regardless of the dog's heritage.\n\n   One night the young man fell asleep on his couch in front of the\nTV. His dogs were on the floor next to him. The young man's\ngirlfriend arrived at the house, rang the door bell and started\nbeating on the door. The young man awoke with a start. His\nwell-trained and socialized bull terriers attacked him. His next\nconflicted thoughts on the proposed vicious dog ordinance came from\nhis hospital bed.\n\n   I grew up before the invention of leash laws, vicious dog\nordinances and breed-specific ordinances.
