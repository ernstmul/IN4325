But when police\nraided a dogfight in southeast Georgia's Wayne County, what\nofficers found was more like a bloodletting.\n\n   Two pit bulls competing in the evening's second fight were\nslowly mauling one another. One had his teeth imbedded in the\nother's throat. The plywood walls of the 10-by-10-foot wooden pit\nwere splattered with blood. The new tan carpet that covered the\nconcrete floor was saturated with gore.\n\n   Police arrested 66 people on the isolated farm near Jesup that\nnight, Nov. 19. Officers confiscated $39,000 that had been wagered\non the five scheduled fights. Afterward, though, came the hard job.\nFirst, the officers put the badly injured dog that lost the second\nfight out of his misery. Then they put the ``winner'' out of his.\n\n   The raid highlighted the popularity of dogfighting in rural\nGeorgia, where it has been a macabre tradition for generations. It\nis so pervasive that, after the raid, police received calls from\nseveral women looking for their husbands. Every man had been at a\ndogfight that night; the wives just weren't sure which fight had\nbeen busted.\n\n   But dogfighting has become more than a rural pastime. In Georgia\nand across the country, police say, it is an increasingly common\nhobby in urban neighborhoods, especially among members of street\ngangs.\n\n   And, thanks to the Internet, this shadowy subculture is reaching\nnew audiences.\n\n   Kennels with names like ``Death Row'' and ``La Cosa Nostra''\noffer to sell dogs bred from champion fighters' bloodlines. In chat\nrooms and on message boards, dog owners discuss breeding and\nfighting strategies. In online magazines, fans read the exploits of\nthe sport's greatest fighters.\n\n   ``In his five contract matches, he destroyed all,'' Pit Bull\nReporter magazine's online edition said in a typical dispatch about\na champion dog named Santa's Mongoose. ``The only one to live\njumped the pit in 15 minutes. He took dogs apart. Bite one got\ntheir attention. Bite number two made them wish they were someplace\nelse. There never was a need for bite three.''\n\n   Such fights are illegal in Georgia and in 46 other states. But\nit is rare for charges to be filed unless police officers witness\nthe matches. Only one person is currently doing time in a Georgia\nprison for dogfighting _ one fewer than for hijacking a bus. Ten\nGeorgians are on probation from dogfighting convictions.\n\n   But police and animal-protection activists say the Georgia\nGeneral Assembly has a chance this winter to crack down on\ndogfighting.\n\n   Lawmakers will consider a bill that would make animal cruelty a\nfelony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence. Police could\nfile cruelty charges against owners of fighting dogs even if they\naren't caught in the act. A dog's injuries _ torn ears, gashes in\nits throat, bite marks covering its body _ would provide enough\nevidence to prove cruelty.\n\n   New ways to combat dogfighting are needed, said Bill Garrett,\nexecutive director of the Atlanta Humane Society.\n\n   Like other animal abusers, Garrett said, the owners of fighting\ndogs ``are like cockroaches. They do most of their work in the dark\nand out of sight.''\n\n   `Dogfights all the time'\n\n   No one knows exactly how widespread dogfighting is in Georgia.\nBut the Humane Society of the United States ranks Georgia as one of\nthe sport's most active states, along with California, Florida,\nLouisiana and Texas.\n\n   ``Dogfighting is fairly prevalent,'' said Geoffrey Simmons, a\nHumane Society official in California. ``It cuts across all\nsocio-economic boundaries. It simply is a sport that appeals to a\nlot of people for a lot of different reasons.''\n\n   In Georgia, ``there's a great deal more of it going on than\npeople realize,'' said Lee Sweat, the Georgia Bureau of\nInvestigation agent who led 50 officers on the Wayne County raid.\n``We hear about dogfights all the time.''\n\n   But few of the sport's fans are willing to discuss it publicly.\n\n   ``Due to the negative light that the media tends to portray\nthese dogs in on a regular basis, I highly doubt that anyone would\nbe interested in discussing anything with any form of media,'' Tim\nMurphy of Jefferson, Ga., who publishes an Internet magazine called\nSporting Dog Online, wrote in an e-mail to a reporter.\n\n   Murphy's magazine features detailed blood lines of fighting\ndogs. It also posts the standard rules for dogfighting. But\nfight-related content, the publication says, is ``for entertainment\npurposes only.''\n\n   Regardless, after declining to talk with a reporter, Murphy sent\nan e-mail to pit bull and dogfighting enthusiasts across the\ncountry, warning of possible scrutiny.\n\n   ``There are these types of people looking for a story about this\nbreed all the time,'' he wrote, ``so please keep this copy and\nremember the (reporter's) name in case you are contacted.''\n\n   `Not friendly people'\n\n   The secrecy that surrounds dogfighting makes the laws\nprohibiting it tough to enforce.\n\n   That is especially true when it comes to so-called\nstreetfighters. Often members of criminal gangs, these dogfighting\nenthusiasts cruise their neighborhoods with their dogs, looking for\nfights.\n\n   ``A lot of it's impromptu,'' said Lt. Larry Gibson of the\nClayton County Police Department's animal control unit. The fights\noften take place ``right in the middle of the street, right in\nsomebody's front yard.''\n\n   Still, Gibson said, ``it's very hard to catch them.'' Even if a\nneighbor calls police, the fights are usually over when officers\narrive. And witnesses are often too afraid of the dogs' owners to\ntestify against them.\n\n   ``Most of these are not friendly people,'' Gibson said of the\nstreetfighters. ``The witnesses have a legitimate fear. ... Eighty\npercent of the people I've dealt with have gone on to bigger and\nbetter crimes.''\n\n   In contrast, other dogfighting fans revel in their sport's long\nhistory and what they see as the nobility of the American pit bull\nterrier. Streetfighters put any breed of dog that will fight into\nmatches. But traditionalists remain loyal to the pit bull _ a breed\nthat, they say, is as gentle with humans as it is aggressive toward\nother dogs.\n\n   Unlike the impromptu street fights, many pit bull matches are\nplanned for weeks or months. And they are widely, if quietly,\nadvertised.\n\n   The 66 people arrested in Wayne County came from all over\nGeorgia and from six other states. The fight was promoted by a club\ncalled ``20/20'' and was held on a farm where the club's secretary\nlives. To promote secrecy, spectators had been told to assemble on\nanother farm. From there, they were led to the fight location by\nthe club's chief of security.\n\n   Each fight was expected to last as long as two hours. Each would\ncontinue, the GBI's Sweat said, ``until one dog wins by either\nkilling the other dog or the other dog's so incapacitated he can't\nfight any more.''\n\n   All 66 who were arrested are free on bond, awaiting trial. Few\nhad ever been in trouble with the law.\n\n   ``In their own little parts of the world, they're not the street\ngang drug dealers,'' Sweat said. ``Probably everybody was gainfully\nemployed. They all drove nice vehicles.''\n\n   All, too, enjoyed what Sweat called ``the perverse excitement of\nwatching one animal tearing another one up.''\n\n   A dogfighter's story\n\n   Antonio Clark watched his first dogfight when he was 7. It was\nthe same year he began breeding pit bulls.\n\n   With family friends, he went to fights ``all over Georgia,\nFlorida, Alabama, Texas,'' recalled Davis, now 28. ``It happens\neverywhere in the United States.''\n\n   The early exposure led to a lifelong enchantment with the sport\n_ a fascination that ultimately brought Davis a dubious\ndistinction: He is the only person serving time in a Georgia prison\nfor dogfighting.\n\n   He didn't start out fighting the dogs he raised, Davis said\nduring an interview at the Carroll County Prison, where he is\nserving one year of a five-year sentence.\n\n   ``Pit bulls, when they first started breeding them, were bred\nfor their gameness _ not to stop fighting,'' Davis said. ``Like\nanybody else, I wanted to breed the best.''\n\n   During the past two decades, he said, he has bred about 1,000\npit bull puppies. Each, he said, sold for $400 to $500.\n\n   Davis wouldn't say when he started putting his dogs in fights.\nBut he said that before his arrest, he had success with a\nparticularly strong fighter he had bred. He named the dog Silkkthe\nShocka, after the rapper.\n\n   In the summer of 1998, Davis put Silkk the Shocka in a fight\nagainst a dog with a lesser reputation. The other dog's owner\nvideotaped the fight.\n\n   Three days later, Davis and several friends were in Friendship\nPark in Clarkston, watching the tape on a video camera. A police\nofficer drove up _ thinking, Davis said, that the group was smoking\nmarijuana. After seeing what was on the tape, the officer charged\nDavis with dogfighting. He pleaded guilty last summer.\n\n   Sitting in prison, wearing a white uniform a shade duller than\nthe white concrete walls, Davis recalled a world of large bets _\n``maybe five G's, 15 G's'' _ and fight purses that reached $2,500.\n\n   Despite his conviction, he expressed little remorse.\n\n   ``If I'm going by the law books, yeah, I did something wrong,''\nhe said. ``But in society, the way people live today, no.''\n\n   Pitting one dog against another isn't cruel, he maintained, ``no\nmore than it is cruel to have two men in the ring boxing.
