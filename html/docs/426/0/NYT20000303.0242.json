The\nbig dog behind the fence barks and snarls and charges the slats\nevery time.\n\n   Sometimes, the dog leaps high enough to get his head and paws\nover the top. You worry that the dog might make it over the fence,\ncould possibly dig under it, could very well get loose if the gate\nis left open.\n\n   Or, you walk at a park in which you and the other owners let\nyour dogs romp together, off leash. There's one dog, however, who\nis big and aggressive and always starts a fight. The owner seems\nproud. ``He is definitely the alpha!'' she always says. You and the\nother owners roll your eyes. Sometimes, the moment the duo walks\ninto the park, you just go home.\n\n   Most of us, at one time or another, have had to deal with a\nmenacing dog. And very often, we don't know what to do about it. In\nfact, our society in general is not very good about identifying the\nbuild-up of aggression in dogs and taking care of it before\nsomething happens.\n\n   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta\nestimates that more than 4.7 million Americans, most of them\nchildren, are bitten by dogs each year. Experts tell us that the\nvast majority of these cases are preventable.\n\n   We consulted Carter Luke of the Massachusetts Society for\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals and two of the best known dog\ntraining experts in the country _ Brian Kilcommons, coauthor of\n``Childproofing Your Dog,'' and Matthew Margolis, coauthor of\n``Grrr! The Complete Guide to Understanding and Preventing\nAggressive Behavior in Dogs'' and host of PBS's dog behavior\nseries, ``Woof!''\n\n   They all agree. Current laws in most cities and towns are\ninadequate in dealing with these issues because they address the\nsituation only after an attack occurs. Still, there are steps you\ncan take to stay safe.\n\n   If a menacing dog lives on your street, take action. ``If an\nadult ran behind a fence chasing and threatening your children as\nthey walked by, you'd call the cops,'' Kilcommons says. You should\ntake a dog behaving that way just as seriously.\n\n   The first step _ if you feel comfortable doing it _ is to speak\nto the owners of the dog. It's hard to imagine they would be\nunaware of the dog's behavior, but you can point it out. They\nshould get training for the dog, socialize it, and neuter it\n(nearly 100 percent of serious maulings in this country are\ncommitted by unfixed dogs, usually male).\n\n   Further, Kilcommons has a novel idea. Owners of menacing dogs\ncan use invisible fencing inside standard fencing. It provides more\nthan double security. It actually reduces the level of aggression\nif the dog can't get right up to pedestrians.\n\n   If that doesn't work, put these people on notice. ``Owners are\nin denial about aggression in their dogs,'' Margolis says. ``People\ncan take you insulting them easier than they can deal with you\ntalking about their dog. They make excuses: `He only growls at\nstrangers.' Great. There are only about 250 million strangers in\nthis country.''\n\n   Even if an owner won't take this behavior seriously, you should.\nAll the experts agree: Send a certified letter to the owners\nstating that their dog is exhibiting aggressive behavior that you\nbelieve is dangerous. The letter is to give fair warning that\nshould something happen, they are fully responsible. Send letters\noutlining the situation to your town's animal control officer, the\npolice, and even the district attorney and ask them to investigate.\n\n   The first thing, however, is always safety. As Luke says, ``Use\nsupervision and avoidance.'' So while sending those letters off,\nhave your children walk a different way home, even if that means\ngoing around the block to avoid one house. If you don't have\nchildren, Luke says, be an upstanding member of your community and\nget involved. If you see unacceptable aggressive behavior in a\nneighborhood dog, say something.\n\n   But, as anyone in a dog play group knows, speaking up can be\ntough. Many of us simply have a hard time broaching uncomfortable\nsubjects.\n\n   But, again, the key is safety _ for you and your dog. Keeping\nyour own dog _ and yourself _ away from danger is worth ostracizing\nsomeone. Tell the owner, Kilcommons says, `` `It's not you. It's\nyour dog's behavior. It has shown aggression repeatedly, and we\ncannot persuade you to control it.' ''\n\n   Owners who say they have control because they can yank their dog\nout of a fight are dead wrong. If you had control of the dog, your\npet wouldn't be acting this way in the first place.\n\n   The MSPCA is pushing for statewide laws that uniformly deal with\nthe issue of dangerous dogs, Luke says. One they are backing calls\nfor the notification to a town or city when a dangerous dog\nbanished from another community moves in.\n\n   The larger issue, according to Luke, is that many antiquated\nrules focus on the dog instead of the owner. But aggressive canine\nbehavior is rarely an untreatable genetic problem, which means the\nonus must be placed on the owner. These are people who have either\nignored or encouraged bad behavior. If their dog is taken away,\nthey will replace it with another and trigger what has literally\nbecome a vicious cycle.\n\n   Further, there are places that have progressive and tough laws\nto curb aggressive dogs. In Oregon, Portland established a model\ndangerous-dog law with five levels of offenders ranging from dogs\nthat menace and threaten to dogs that cause serious injury or\ndeath. The penalties range from confinement on a leash to, for the\nworst cases, euthanasia for the dog and removal of the owner's\nright to ever own a dog again.\n\n   If you are a true dog lover and you know the incredible good\nthey are capable of, you will be the least patient with owners who\nbring out the worst in their dogs.
