The camp\nis designed so that dogs and their owners can enjoy activities\ntogether and learn, hands-on, new training techniques with\npractical everyday uses.\n\n   Each day of the three-day event provides many different\nexercises and activities for dogs and their trainers. Activities\nsuch as herding, water games, obstacle courses and agility tests\nare held during the morning hours.\n\n   In the afternoon the dogs get a rest while their owners attend\nvarious lectures on topics ranging from innovations in obedience\ntraining to dog chiropractics and massage.\n\n   ``We shape behavior through positive methods. We don't use any\nnegative reinforcement,'' said Becky Campbell.\n\n   The positive method approach seemed to be the underlying message\nat the dog camp. By teaching your dog to obey you through positive\nmethods, such as rewards and positive verbal reinforcement, a\ntrainer develops a better rapport with the dog, and eventually a\nfriendship built on mutual respect and trust, Campbell said.\n\n   Paul Tucker and his wife, Leigh Ann, were in attendance at this\nyear's camp to give lessons on sheep herding. Paul, along with his\ndog Craig, has won many awards for sheep herding including the Ohio\nValley Dog of the Year.\n\n   This year Craig is in fourth place for Ohio Valley Dog of The\nYear, despite the fact that he is almost 12 years old.\n\n   Even though Paul is very competitive with his dogs, the\ncompetition at the camp is rather nonexistent. There are awards\ngiven for various events, but the main point is to let the dogs\nhave fun. Even if a dog is not a purebred herding dog, or maybe\neven 10 times smaller than the sheep, Paul will still let them have\nan opportunity to try their ``paw'' at sheep herding.\n\n   ``We only bring experienced sheep, so that they know what to do\neven if the dogs don't,'' said Leigh Ann Tucker. ``The purpose is\nnot to make a sheep dog out of a poodle, it's to let a poodle see\nwhat it's like to be a sheep dog.''\n\n   Among the many lecturers in attendance this year was Leslie\nNelson, one the most prominent names in the country for animal\nobedience. Nelson spoke about advanced dog training techniques.\nNelson continued the theme of positive reinforcement in her lecture\ntelling people that the more they force their dog to obey the less\nthe dog will enjoy activities with them.\n\n   A new event this year at the camp is something Darla Paganini\nlikes to call ``Dancing With Dogs.'' This is like free-style\ngymnastics with your dog. The owner and the dog work on a dance\nroutine set to music and often involving costumes. Darla and her\ndog do a routine to the song ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight.'' Darla\nwears a safari uniform, her dog a lion costume. They even complete\nthe event with a bow.\n\n   The event that seemed to be enjoyed by the dogs the most was the\nlure course.\n\n   At this event, basically the dogs chase a white bag around a\nfield. The bag, or ``bunny'' as it is referred to, is placed on a\nwire and run by a generator.\n\n   The bag is kept in constant motion, just inches in front of the\ndog. ``This is an event just about any dog can do with little or no\ntraining,'' said Corkey Campbell. ``What dog doesn't like to chase\nthings.\n\n   ``This is really a camp where you can come and bring your dog to\nsample just about everything that is going on either professionally\nor for fun,'' said Corkey.\n\n   And that is exactly what the camp is, a great place to bring you\ndog to have\n\n   fun. The camp is open to all dogs and owners.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   OXFORD, Ohio _ Usually reserved for two-legged athletes during\nsummer sports camps, Camp\n","\n   America, located just outside of Hueston Woods State Park in\nsouthwest Ohio, recently was home to a unique camp designed for\nfour-legged friends.\n","\n   For the past four years Becky and Corkey Campbell have been\nrunning their special breed of dog camp at the facility.
