This is where doggies can satisfy every fascination,\nwhether it be stick or tennis ball fixations or sniffing\nobsessions. Another great off-leash dog run area in San Francisco\nis at the Presidio, especially starting from the parking lot\nadjacent to the Presidio Golf Course.\n\n   Racks installed by the National Park Service provide dog owners\nwith plastic bags for cleaning up refuse so it can be disposed of\nproperly.\n\n   There are many other great destinations throughout the Bay Area\nand beyond where you can take your dog.

Two of the best here are the Point\nIsabel Shoreline near Berkeley and the Sunol Region Wilderness.\n\n   Among the worst destinations with dogs are the state parks and\nstate beaches in the Bay Area, such as Big Basin Redwoods and Half\nMoon Bay State Beach, where dogs are prohibited on the trails.\nAmong state parks, McNee Ranch at Montara is a rare exception.\nAnother agency on the doggy dirt list is the Midpeninsula Open\nSpace District, which prohibits dogs on trails at its 10 best\npreserves.\n\n   In the mountain country, dogs are welcome across 20 million\nacres of national forests in California, featuring thousands of\nmiles of trails, no leash required.
