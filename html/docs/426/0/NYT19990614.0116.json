Along with other\nvolunteers, Levine, a Londoner by origin, wiped out graffiti,\nchased out drug dealers and in general spruced up the little park.\n\n   Grateful youngsters and their families swarmed all over it. But\nnow, says Levine, he fears that Sunnyside Park will lose out to an\nunexpected adversary: dogs.\n\n   It is one of 19 parks due to become ``off-leash'' areas as San\nFrancisco tries to accommodate the growing number of dogs living\nwithin the city.\n\n   Levine has pleaded with officials to maintain the park primarily\nfor local people and their children _ and for dogs on a leash. He\nhas been cursed by dog owners, chaired meetings that dissolved into\nshouting matches, and recently opened his car door to find a pile\nof dog-poop on the seat.\n\n   ``The dog owners have obviously tried to send me a message,''\nLevine explains.\n\n   Few issues are hotter just now in urban America than whether\ndogs should be given free run of public parks in these off-leash\nareas (OLAs, in bureaucratese).\n\n   Battles over dogs have erupted in Florida, Oregon, New York,\nConnecticut, Wyoming and Washington, to name but a few. ``I would\nequate it to abortion,'' Nick Licata says with a gulp; he is a city\ncouncillor here in Seattle who has tried to mediate between dog\nowners and the rest of humanity.\n\n   Why all the woofing? Canine demographics, for one thing. It is\nreckoned that 58 million dogs live in the United States. Although\nthe number has held steady (and is now exceeded by the 66 million\nor so cats kept as pets), several new developments have complicated\nthe issue.\n\n   For one, more and more dogs are living in cities or thickly\npopulated suburbs where they have no back gardens in which to romp\n(or dump). It also seems that many dog owners are opting for larger\nbreeds; the boisterous, bulky Labrador retriever is now the most\npopular breed in the country.\n\n   To make things worse, many people have come to regard dogs as\nsomething more than a furry household accessory. They have become\nfamily members, showered with Christmas gifts and birthday presents\nand treated to a romp on the park as readily as a five-year-old\nchild would be.\n\n   Most cities have long looked the other way as dogs ran loose in\nthe parks and the streets. But, as American cities have grown more\nattractive and property values have risen, humans have sought to\nreassert their control over the parks.\n\n   A culture clash almost worthy of the Balkans has resulted. Dog\nowners cannot see why everyone doesn't find Shiloh or Molly or\nSheba adorable. Non-owners feel harassed by rambunctious dogs, and\nsee parks becoming dog-poop minefields.\n\n   Most dog owners manage their dogs responsibly, says Nicholas\nDodman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Tufts University and\nthe author of several books on dogs. But, as is so often the case,\nthe bad behavior of the few tars the many.\n\n   Dodman is particularly disturbed by the dog owner who pretends\nto be surprised when his animal attacks someone.\n\n   ``All the people who come to me with aggressive dogs know that\ntheir dogs are aggressive,'' he says.\n\n   In late March, two unleashed Rottweilers in Seattle attacked and\nnearly killed a two-year-old. Officials destroyed one dog; the\nowner then claimed the other dog was trying to ``save'' the child.\n\n   Often the dog problem is not really a dog problem at all; it is\na people problem.\n\n   In New York, for instance, the quality-of-life crackdown on\nsqueegee men and jaywalkers by the city's mayor, Rudolf Giuliani,\nhas recently been imitated in a campaign against unruly dogs led by\nHenry Stern, the parks commissioner.\n\n   Stern has proposed tighter enforcement of leash laws and bigger\nfines for off-leash scofflaws. To support his case, he has amassed\na stack of letters from irate New Yorkers. Most of them complain\nmore about abusive dog owners than aggressive dogs.\n\n   One recalled being harassed by a large off-the-leash mutt.\n``Quit moving, and the dog won't bother you,'' explained the owner.\n\n   It can be worse than that. One owner gave the name of ``Eva\nBraun'' when stopped for having an illegally off-leash dog, and\nanother hung a sign marked ``Treblinka'' on a newly installed\nanti-dog fence.\n\n   Therein lies a moral. So far in America dog owners have had the\nupper hand. As Licata observes, most of the people who turn up at\nmeetings to discuss the issue are those with dogs, not with\ngrouches about dogs.\n\n   This may be changing. In Avon, Conn., leash-law supporters\nhandily outvoted supporters of more liberal off-leash rules in a\nreferendum last year. If enough dogs behave badly enough, a lot\nmore victims are liable to turn on the people who own the dogs.   \n      \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this excellent 825-word ECONOMIST article, it must be\npurchased from the New York Times Syndicate's sales representative\nDEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at 732-390-4697.
