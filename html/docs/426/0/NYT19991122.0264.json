George W. Bush and a\ndisturbing coziness with the industries that the commission\nregulates, an allegation that state officials dispute.\n\n   The drop in penalties comes as an increasingly harsh spotlight\nfocuses attention on the state's environmental problems. As\nDallas-Fort Worth struggles to meet federal air standards and\nAustin edges closer to violating them, Houston recently passed Los\nAngeles as the smog capital of the United States.\n\n   ``We're seeing some things that otherwise might have been caught\nby inspectors going unpenalized,'' said Ken Kramer, director of the\nTexas branch of the Sierra Club, a national environmental\norganization.\n\n   Kramer said Bush's ``whole approach to regulation has been\nprimarily one of laissez faire, in which business and industry is\nallowed to call the shots. In that type of atmosphere, there's not\ngoing to be any tough enforcement.''\n\n   Bush's aides and commission officials see the enforcement trend\ndifferently. For one thing, the commission _ controlled by Bush\nappointees _ says the number of enforcement actions being taken to\ncourt has risen, so getting a final resolution has taken longer in\nsome cases.\n\n   In addition, orders requiring companies to take some type of\ncorrective action dramatically increased during the past 10 years _\nfrom a little over 200 in 1990 to more than 600 in 1999 _ even\nthough penalties have gone down.\n\n   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said an ``all-time record high''\nof about $27 million in fines was levied in 1998. That figure\nincluded court-imposed fines generated by legal action taken by the\nTexas attorney general's office in addition to fines imposed by the\nnatural resource commission. She was unable to provide a breakdown\nof how much was assessed by the commission or generated by legal\naction, although she said most of the fines were the result of\naction by the attorney general's office.\n\n   ``Enforcement of environmental protection has been strong during\nGovernor Bush's tenure,'' she said, pointing to the spike in\nenforcement orders issued by the commission.\n\n   Officials say one reason that penalties have dropped is that the\nagency has gotten better at catching violations early, in part\nthrough voluntary programs, thus avoiding the necessity of\nassessing penalties.\n\n   ``I think we are addressing violations earlier in the process,\nand as a result you are having fewer penalty events,'' said Paul\nSarahan, the commission's director of litigation. ``People are\ngetting into compliance sooner.''\n\n   According to agency figures, the total amount of fines collected\nin fiscal 1999 (which ended Aug. 31) was $4 million. The most\nrecent year in which regulators collected a lower amount was 1992,\nwhen $3.5 million in penalties was collected, figures show.\n\n   That compares with $4.6 million in 1998, $4.1 million in 1997\nand $6.9 million in 1996. The highest penalty level in the past 10\nyears occurred in 1993, when $9.1 million was collected.\n\n   Apart from fines, the commission also requires companies under\nenforcement orders to engage in ``supplemental environmental\nprojects,'' in which companies agree to fund local ecological\nimprovements in lieu of penalties.\n\n   In 1996, for example, more than $4 million in such projects were\nrequired, meaning that, when combined with penalties, companies\nwere required to spend more than $11 million to comply with\nenforcement orders.\n\n   Still, even after adding in the amounts for supplemental\nprojects, the total dollar amount that companies were required to\nspend as a result of enforcement activity is at a seven-year low.\n\n   Vice President Al Gore, a Democratic presidential candidate and\npossible Bush rival for the White House, has repeatedly hammered\nTexas for its environmental problems, recently noting that the\nstate was ``No. 1 in the pollution of water, air and ground.''\n\n   The figures that Gore is using come from the Toxic Release\nInventory compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The\ndata show that Texas led the nation in 1997 in total toxic\nemissions, which include releases on land and in the air and water.\n\n   Texas has led the nation in toxic air releases since 1988,\naccording to Ramon Alvarez, staff scientist at the Environmental\nDefense Fund in Austin, which has analyzed the EPA data.\n\n   In total releases of all toxic emissions, Texas has had the\nworst record in the nation since 1994, with Louisiana close behind,\nhe said.\n\n   MORE   \nnn\n\n   Environmentalists and state officials say one factor driving the\ndownturn in penalties is a controversial state program that\nencourages voluntary compliance with environmental laws:\nself-audits.\n\n   By conducting internal audits, companies can confidentially\ndivulge violations and receive immunity from penalties.\nParticipation in the program has steadily grown since it was\nintroduced in 1995.\n\n   There have been 260 notices that violations _ and multiple\nviolations _ have been discovered during self-audits since the\nprogram began in 1995, commission figures show.\n\n   Officials were unable to say how many violations have been\ndiscovered altogether, although former commission Chairman Barry\nMcBee testified before Congress in 1997 that there were, on\naverage, 4.3 violations per disclosure.\n\n   If that rate held constant, that would mean that about 1,000\nviolations have been disclosed to the commission under the\nself-audit program.\n\n   Although companies can still receive penalties even after\ndisclosing violations if the infraction involves willful\nnoncompliance, the commission's audit coordinator, Scottie Aplin,\nsaid she knew of no such penalties ever being imposed.\n\n   ``The idea is not to avoid or prevent them from getting\npenalties,'' she said. ``The idea is to get them into their\nfacilities and getting them into compliance.''\n\n   Environmentalists criticize the law because the detailed\ninformation about the violations is kept secret.\n\n   ``The public has come to accept it as their right to know what\nviolations of environmental laws have happened in their\ncommunities,'' said Robin Schneider, director of Public Research\nWorks, a Texas environmental group. ``You're going to see a lot\nfewer violations being punished.''\n\n   Another factor that watchdog groups cite in explaining the\npenalty downturn is a relatively new policy, drafted in 1995,\nagainst unannounced inspections.
