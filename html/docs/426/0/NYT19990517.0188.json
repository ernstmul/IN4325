BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Now that people and pets are spending more time outdoors, the\nincidence of dog bites is about to soar, which is why the Humane\nSociety of the United States in conjunction with other concerned\nagencies is once again urging the public to learn how to act around\ndogs and what to do to prevent dog bites.\n\n   The statistics are cause for concern. Each year, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention estimates, 4.7 million people are\nbitten by dogs, 800,000 of them badly enough to require medical\ntreatment. At least 60 percent of dog bites and 72 percent of fatal\nbites involve children. Half of all children in this country are\nbitten by a dog before their 12th birthday. And since children are\nmost often bitten on the face, many need plastic surgery to\nminimize unsightly scars.\n\n   Few people are schooled in how to behave around dogs, either\ntheir own or someone else's, and many dog owners handle their pets\nin ways that ask for trouble. Potentially disastrous encounters\nbetween dogs and children _ or dogs and adults _ are extremely\ncommon. A child tries to pet a dog on the street without first\nasking if it is safe to do so. Or a child frightened by a dog runs\naway, unwittingly inviting the animal to a chase. Adults, too, may\nshout or flail at an aggressive dog or raise their arms to protect\nthemselves, which the dog may interpret as a threat that warrants\nan attack. Or an adult may try to calm a frightened child by\nsaying, ``See, the dog is friendly, he's wagging his tail,'' when\ntail-wagging can be a sign of anger or aggression as well as\nfriendship.\n\n   Adding to the concern is the fact that most bites are inflicted\nnot by strange dogs but by dogs belonging to the family, a friend\nor a neighbor. In other words, the person bitten is known to the\ndog but doesn't know how to behave around the dog to avoid being\nbitten.\n\n   Dr. Wayne Hunthausen, a veterinarian at Westwood Animal Hospital\nin Westwood, Kan., who specializes in pet behavior, says children _\nand, of course, adults too _ can learn how to act safely around\ndogs and cats in just 30 minutes. That is how long it takes to view\nthe award-winning video he stars in, ``Dogs, Cats & Kids: Learning\nto Be Safe with Animals,'' produced by Donald Manelli and\nAssociates and available for $19.95 plus $3.95 for shipping and\nhandling by telephoning (800) 337-3615.\n\n   Everyone should know, for example, how to read a dog's body\nlanguage and know when to keep away. A fearful animal holds its\nears down, tucks its tail under its body and may shake, growl or\nback away. But trying to befriend it, which many would do\ninstinctively, is inviting an attack, Hunthausen says. Likewise,\nstay clear of a dog that is angry or aggressively protecting its\nterritory: ears are up and forward, eyes look directly at you, tail\nis up and may be wagging slowly, hair may be standing up on the\nneck, back and tail, and the dog is likely to be barking or\ngrowling with teeth exposed. Cut a wide swath around such an\nanimal.\n\n   If you are approached by an aggressive dog, whether you are a\nchild or an adult, the best defense is to freeze. Act like a tree:\nperfectly still with hands in fists held close to the body, don't\nyell or say anything and don't look at the animal. Dogs interpret\ndirect eye contact as a threat or challenge. If a dog knocks you\ndown, act like a rock: roll into a fetal position with knees up,\nelbows tucked in and hands in fists held against your ears.\n\n   About 70 percent of children are bitten by dogs they know. When\npetting any dog, pet along the side or back of the animal's body,\nnot the head, face or ears, which are more sensitive. Don't tease\nthe dog or play rough with it. Play safe games like fetch or\nFrisbee, not tug-of-war. Learn to respect the dog's private times.\nNever bother a dog when it is eating, resting, sleeping or chewing\non something.\n\n   Too often, Hunthausen said, ``kids assume they can treat a\nneighbor's dog the way they treat their own.'' Don't pet a dog that\nis not your own without permission. A dog belonging to someone else\nshould not be petted unless an adult is present. Ask whether the\ndog is friendly and if it is OK to pet it.\n\n   If you are given the go-ahead, move slowly toward the dog so as\nnot to frighten it, and don't immediately reach out your hand to\npet it. Instead, first make a loose fist and hold it out toward the\ndog with the back of your hand up and a little ways from the side\nof your body. Let the dog decide whether it wants to come up and\nsniff your hand. ``If it doesn't, that's where the greeting should\nstop,'' said Hunthausen, who is a co-editor or co-author of two\nprofessional texts on pet behavior and training. Never chase after\na dog that is not interested in playing with you.\n\n   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\noffers more some additional advice: Do not tease dogs behind\nfences, do not go near dogs chained up in yards or tied to trees or\npoles with leashes or ropes and don't touch dogs that are outside\nand off leashes. Never go near a stray dog.\n\n   If you are charged by a dog, don't yell or scream, but\nimmediately offer an article of clothing, gym bag, purse or other\nitem for the animal to tug on, recommends Jacque Schultz, director\nof special projects in the A.S.P.C.A.'s animal sciences division.\nAnd if a dog should grab your arm or leg, instead of pulling away,\npush into the animal's mouth as hard as you can, Ms. Schultz\nadvises.\n\n   It will cause the dog to feel like it is losing control of the\nsituation and it will let go and run away, she said. This tactic\nwill also keep your flesh from tearing against the dog's teeth as\nyou pull away. This technique was part of the protective training\nshe gave last year to field workers for Con Edison in New York, and\none worker already reported using it and escaping with just a torn\njacket.\n\n   The Humane Society notes that by spaying or neutering a dog,\nowners can reduce by three-fold the risk that the animal will bite\nsomeone. Owners should also be especially cautious when dogs are in\nnew situations or are around people they don't know.\n\n   Every dog and its owner should go through behavior training,\npreferably when the animal is young. Dogs should be properly\nsocialized to being with people and other dogs and in a wide\nvariety of situations so that they are less easily frightened.\nTraining is best done, Hunthausen said, when the dog is a 8 to 10\nweeks old. At this age, they learn with lightning speed, much\nfaster than at 6 or 8 months, he said. Ask your local vet to\nrecommend a trainer or puppy classes.\n\n   Hunthausen also said dogs learned best when rewarded for doing\nthe right thing, rather than when punished for doing something\nwrong. He insists that owners should never use harsh physical\npunishment, prong collars, shock collars and other painful training\ntechniques. In his experience, dog bites often follow harsh\npunishment.\n\n   Owners must also supervise their pets, obey leash laws and deal\nswiftly aggressive behavior. Hunthausen says owners often make the\nmistake of trying to calm a dog by petting it when it acts\naggressively, but this only serves to reward the animal and\nreinforce the unwanted behavior. As with any unwanted behavior, the\nowner must let the dog know who is boss and that the boss is\ndispleased. In this case, the owner should take control and\nimmediately remove the dog from the situation.\n\n   Finally, an owner should never defend a dangerous dog. Any dog\nthat commits an unprovoked, uninhibited severe or fatal attack must\nbe destroyed. It is not safe to send it to another location or\nowner.\n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: HEEDING WARNINGS FROM DANGEROUS DOGS \n","Text":["\n   Now that people and pets are spending more time outdoors, the\nincidence of dog bites is about to soar, which is why the Humane\nSociety of the United States in conjunction with other concerned\nagencies is once again urging the public to learn how to act around\ndogs and what to do to prevent dog bites.\n","\n   The statistics are cause for concern.
