COHEN \nc.2000 Los Angeles Daily News \n\n   LOS ANGELES _ At offices across the nation, it was a dog's life\nFriday.\n\n   There was rawhide to be chewed, plenty of floor to sniff at, and\na few spots around the office to be marked.\n\n   ``Pee happens,'' said West Los Angeles psychologist Judy\nBin-Nun, who organized dog-day activities for her entire\nprofessional building and dressed in a dog costume for the\noccasion.\n\n   Friday was officially the second annual Take Your Dog to Work\nDay, an event started last year by Pet Sitters International and\npromoted heavily by online retailer Pets.com.\n\n   ``We're vying for top honors,'' said Bin-Nun, whose husband\nworks in the same building. ``We've got the rudest dog contest,\nmost beautiful eyes, best fur.''\n\n   Her 13-year-old Brussels griffon, Max, might be a shoo-in for\nrudest dog. While awaiting the festivities, Max decided to relieve\nhimself on the floor of the office.\n\n   Despite the occasional obvious drawbacks, pets at work can be a\nboon to employee morale and productivity, said Pets.com President\nChris Deyo.\n\n   ``When dogs come to the workplace, it actually has some\nsignificant benefits. It becomes a more productive work\nenvironment,'' Deyo said. ``People tend to stay at work longer,\nbecause they don't have to rush home so the dog can go to the\nbathroom.''\n\n   At Pets.com, every day is take-your-dog-to-work day, Deyo said.\n\n   The company finds that the practice makes its employees happy,\nhe said.\n\n   ``There are some proven studies about animals reducing stress,''\nDeyo said. ``Also, it's like an icebreaker to a certain extent.\nPeople who work in different departments end up interacting.''\n\n   Having dogs around is a fairly regular occurrence at Santa\nMonica Studios, said employee Cynthia Rickerd, who brought her\nyellow Labrador retriever, Dakota, to work Friday.\n\n   ``Once you're around them and you see how loyal and loving they\nare, everybody just warms up,'' Rickerd said. ``People come up to\nyour animal, and before you know it, you're just talking.''\n\n   One of the goals for Pets.com is to try to get other companies\nto adopt pets-allowed policies. Of course, there is the potential\nbusiness upside for the company, Deyo admitted.\n\n   ``Not being able to take your dog to work is a barrier to pet\nownership,'' he said. And the more pet owners there are, the more\npotential Pets.com customers.\n\n   The event has attracted acceptance in some high-profile circles.\nFormer presidential candidate Bob Dole, now in private law\npractice, brought his dog to work Friday.\n\n   More than 3,000 companies have requested an information packet\non Take Your Dog to Work Day from Pets.com, Deyo said.\n\n   X X X\n","Headline":"\nPETS AT WORK MAY CATCH ON\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ At offices across the nation, it was a dog's life\nFriday.\n","\n   There was rawhide to be chewed, plenty of floor to sniff at, and\na few spots around the office to be marked.\n","\n   ``Pee happens,'' said West Los Angeles psychologist Judy\nBin-Nun, who organized dog-day activities for her entire\nprofessional building and dressed in a dog costume for the\noccasion.\n","\n   Friday was officially the second annual Take Your Dog to Work\nDay, an event started last year by Pet Sitters International and\npromoted heavily by online retailer Pets.com.\n","\n   ``We're vying for top honors,'' said Bin-Nun, whose husband\nworks in the same building. ``We've got the rudest dog contest,\nmost beautiful eyes, best fur.''\n","\n   Her 13-year-old Brussels griffon, Max, might be a shoo-in for\nrudest dog.
