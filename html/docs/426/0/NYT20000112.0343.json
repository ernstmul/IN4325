Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a federal law\nthat bars states from selling their databases of personal\ninformation on licensed drivers and automobile owners.\n\n   States had challenged the law in courts around the country, and\nthe unanimous decision was a rare federal victory in the ongoing\nbattle at the court over federal vs. state authority.

Rehnquist's unusually brief nine-page\nopinion was framed entirely in terms of federalism: whether\nCongress had the constitutional authority to pass the law, and\nwhether the law infringed on state prerogatives.\n\n   As to congressional authority, the chief justice said the law\nfit comfortably within Congress' power to regulate interstate\ncommerce, because the information was ``an article of commerce'' in\nthe context of the statute and ``its sale or release into the\ninterstate stream of business is sufficient to support\ncongressional regulation.''\n\n   As to state prerogatives, Rehnquist said the concerns that had\nled the court recently to invalidate a provision of the Brady gun\ncontrol law and of a nuclear waste disposal law were simply\ninapplicable. He said that unlike those statutes, which required\nstate officials to assist in federal law enforcement, and state\nlegislatures to deal with radioactive waste in particular ways, the\nDrivers Privacy Protection Act was a straightforward federal\nregulation of state activity that raised no federalism issues.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   In effect, the court said the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals\nhad made a category error in treating the driver privacy law as one\nthat raised states' rights concerns.\n\n   The law ``does not require the states in their sovereign\ncapacity to regulate their own citizens,'' the chief justice said,\nadding, ``It does not require the South Carolina legislature to\nenact any laws or regulations, and it does not require state\nofficials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes\nregulating private individuals.''\n\n   He said the law simply ``regulates the states as the owners of\ndatabases,'' a permissible federal role.\n\n   When the case was argued in November, several justices expressed\ntheir concern to Attorney General Charlie Condon of South Carolina\nthat under the state's theory, states could not be required to\nadhere to federal food and drug laws or other garden-variety\nfederal regulations. Even in its tilt toward the states in its\nrecent series of federalism decisions, the court has not gone that\nfar.\n\n   The court's view of the case, Reno vs. Condon, No. 98-1464,\npermitted it to avoid confronting the most provocative aspect of\nthe 4th Circuit's 1998 ruling, that the federal government could\nregulate the states only by means of ``generally applicable'' laws.\nSince only states issue drivers' licenses, the law impermissibly\nsingled out the states for regulation, the appeals court ruled.\n\n   Rehnquist said that because the law also regulated use of the\ninformation by ``private resellers or redisclosers,'' it was in\nfact a generally applicable law, and there was no reason to rule on\nthe validity of the appeals court's approach. To this degree,\nWednesday's decision did not so much resolve an important\nfederalism issue as defer the debate to another day.\n\n   States were not the only ones to object to the Drivers Privacy\nProtection Act. A brief filed on South Carolina's behalf by the\nReporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the American\nSociety of Newspaper Editors told the court the law ignored the\nbroad public interest in access to information that is a ``basic\ntool for reporting.'' For example, the brief said, The Miami Herald\nused drivers' records in 1991 to disclose that 70,000 people in\nsouth Florida had been caught driving with suspended licenses.\n\n   On the other side, the Feminist Majority Foundation, which filed\na brief in support of the law on behalf of abortion clinics and\nvictims of domestic violence, said the decision was an important\nvictory.
