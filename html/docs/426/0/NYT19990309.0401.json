The Clinton administration's\nreluctance to meet that demand has unleashed a bipartisan attack on\nthe White House.\n\n   ``I believe it is inexcusable for the administration to submit a\nbudget to Congress that does not include funding for additional\nBorder Patrol agents,'' U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, an El Paso,\nTexas, Democrat and former Border Patrol chief, told a\ncongressional committee on immigration last month.\n\n   Reno's caution comes during a tense time on the 2,000-mile\nU.S-Mexico border, where violent incidents involving law\nenforcement agents and illegal immigrants are occurring with what\nappears to be increasing frequency.\n\n   In February, a Border Patrol agent near Eagle Pass, Texas, shot\nand wounded an illegal immigrant who threatened him with a gun. And\nin January, an illegal immigrant who carried nothing more than a\nwater jug was shot in the back also near Eagle Pass by Wilbur\nHoneycutt, a member of a DEA task force. The immigrant is paralyzed\nfrom the waist down.\n\n   Though that shooting did not involve the Border Patrol, critics\nblame the incident on Honeycutt's inexperience. A former part-time\npolice officer in Bandera, Honeycutt came to Eagle Pass with little\nborder training and had been there for less than a year at the time\nof the shooting.\n\n   Unfamiliarity with the border is also widely seen as having\nplayed a role in the death of Esequiel Hernandez, a West Texas\nteen-ager and U.S. citizen who was herding goats when he was\nmistakenly shot by a Marine on an anti-narcotics operation in 1997.\n\n   But Reno's go-slow approach was heavily criticized by Texas\nlawmakers, who see the attorney general's caution as a virtual\nsurrender by the Clinton administration in the battle against\nillegal immigration and drug trafficking.\n\n   ``This administration has a horrendous record when it comes to\nborder security,'' said Allan Kay, a spokesman for Lamar Smith, a\nSan Antonio Republican who chairs the House immigration\nsubcommittee. ``They're not interested. They've never been\ninterested.''\n\n   In fact, Reno told the Senate subcommittee, the Clinton\nadministration has since 1994 added nearly 2,000 immigration\ninspectors and deployed ``field-tested effective technologies,'' in\naddition to overseeing a 122 percent jump in Border Patrol agents.\nShe called the border buildup ``unprecedented.''\n\n   ``The fiscal year 2000 budget request continues this aggressive\neffort,'' said Reno, ``but also reflects important management\nconsiderations that can no longer be ignored.''\n\n   Reno added, ``The high proportion of new agents makes it\nnecessary that they be allowed to integrate into the Border Patrol\ncorps to safeguard the highest standards of law enforcement\nprofessionalism for this new workforce.''\n\n   But Reyes told the immigration subcommittee that all five Texas\nBorder Patrol chiefs told a member of his staff they\n``desperately'' need more agents. He said the administration's\nrationale for the slow-down is flawed, and that in El Paso, for\nexample, only 14 percent of the agents have less than two years\nexperience.\n\n   ``You wonder who makes those decisions,'' said Reyes. ``It\ncertainly isn't anyone that knows or understands Border Patrol\noperations or requirements.''\n\n   Though unpopular among lawmakers, Reno's position was met with\nsome support among the local law enforcement community along the\nborder. Robert Serna, the district attorney for Maverick County,\nwhich encompasses Eagle Pass, said safety should be the top concern\nfor illegal immigrants and locals.\n\n   ``I would agree with the attorney general,'' said Serna. ``You\nneed to make sure that when you fight a problem the fighting does\nnot become a problem in itself.''\n\n   Likewise, immigration advocates applauded the administration's\npush for a pause in the border buildup. They say sharp increases in\nborder enforcement threaten the rights of immigrants while doing\nlittle to stop the seemingly inexorable flow.\n\n   ``When officers are not well-trained it's a lot more dangerous\nfor everybody,'' said Benito Juarez, coordinator for the Houston\nImmigration and Refugee Coalition.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nRENO URGES PUTTING BRAKES ON BORDER PATROL BUILDUP \n\n","Text":["\n   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday\nurged Congress to slow the law enforcement buildup on the\nU.S.-Mexico border, warning that a sizable influx of inexperienced\nagents could undermine workforce standards.\n","\n   ``Law enforcement experts indicate that it is risky to allow an\nagency's overall ratio of inexperienced to experienced agents to\nexceed 30 percent,'' Reno told a Senate subcommittee in Washington,\nD.C.\n","\n   ``As of July 1998,'' she told the appropriations subcommittee,\n``the percentage of Border Patrol agents having two years of\nexperience or less was almost 39 percent.''\n","\n   While the Border Patrol has more than doubled to almost 9,000\nsince 1994 _ and continues to grow _ lawmakers are pressing for an\nadditional 1,000 agents for next year.
