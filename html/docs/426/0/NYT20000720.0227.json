Times News Service    \n\n   No amount of scolding, begging or foot-stomping will keep most\ndogs home in their yards and out of the streets. So some frazzled\nowners try to turn their neighborhood travelers into docile\nhomebodies with radio-controlled fences.\n\n   These hidden fences consist of wire loops, buried an inch or two\nbelow the surface, that emit radio signals when connected to\ntransmitters. Each dog wears a collar with a receiver; when the dog\ngets too close to the wire, the collar emits a warning beep. If the\ndog ignores the beep, the collar's two metal prongs give the dog a\nmild shock, or a series of shocks if the dog persists.\n\n   Debby and Ed Christian have two Old English sheepdogs, who are\nso well trained by a hidden fence that they never leave the\nChristians' yard in Acton, Mass. ``I could probably not even use\nthe collars anymore,'' Christian said, ``and the dogs would stay.\nEven when another dog comes into the yard, my dogs won't leave.''\n\n   The Christians bought a version called Invisible Fence, made by\nISCO Enterprises. Their 8-year-old male, Fletcher, and 2-year-old\nfemale, Phoebe, figured out the invisible barrier right away.\n\n   When dogs are trained, flags are posted along the boundary wire\nand the dogs are walked toward them on a leash. As the dogs\napproach the flags, the dogs hear their collars beep. They are told\n``no'' and are turned back toward the house. The final step in the\nprocess, which is repeated over several days, is to deliver a mild\nshock _ or correction, the euphemism favored by all the\nhidden-fence manufacturers _ to reinforce the idea that the dog\nshould not cross the boundary line. Some dogs require only one\nshock to learn to stay within the hidden fence, while others need\nseveral.\n\n   The shock hurts the dog, but it causes no lasting harm. The dogs\nyelp, said Dr. Melissa Bain, a resident in clinical animal behavior\nat the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of\nCalifornia at Davis, but the punishment has to be unpleasant to be\neffective.\n\n   ``I was petrified of what was going to happen when the shock was\ngiven,'' Christian said. ``Fletcher jumped in the air and never\nwent near the boundary again.''\n\n   ``The shock works,'' said Dr. Katherine Houpt, the director of\nthe Animal Behavioral Clinic for the College of Veterinary Medicine\nat Cornell University, ``because it is simple aversion learning.\nHowever, it works best with those dogs that are not highly\nmotivated to leave.'' Among the more difficult pupils she described\nare male dogs that are not neutered, dogs that like to hunt or\nchase cars and highly territorial dogs that are eager to cross\nboundaries to scare off approaching strangers.\n\n   The Invisible Fence was invented in 1973 by Richard Peck, a\ntraveling salesman and animal lover who was saddened by the number\nof dead dogs he saw on the side of the road. When his patents\nexpired in 1990, several other companies joined the industry. Some\nof the products, like Invisible Fence and DogWatch, made by\nDogWatch Inc., are sold by independent dealers who install the\nproduct and usually train the dogs (and owners).\n\n   While prices vary among dealers nationally, a system enclosing a\nquarter-acre costs about $600 from Invisible Fences and about $900\nfrom DogWatch. Even the most expensive hidden fence is considerably\ncheaper than a chain-link or wood fence.\n\n   Products that are installed by the customer, who has to bury the\nwire around the perimeter of the property and do the dog training,\ncost much less. Radio Systems Corp. of Concord, Tenn., for example,\nsells a system, under the PetSafe brand, that will enclose 25 acres\nfor just under $200.\n\n   Some dogs are willing to endure the punishment in order to leave\nthe property, especially when they learn that the shock is brief.\nOne such dog is Teddy, a 3-year-old Pomeranian-and-terrier mix\nowned by Renee and Gregory Abel of St. Louis.\n\n   ``If she sees a dog walking by the yard, she doesn't care about\nthe zap,'' Abel said. ``She'll run through it. We have to go get\nher, take off the collar and carry her back over the wire.'' The\nfence system works about 85 percent of the time, Abel said. ``I\nfeel bad about the shock, but we'd feel worse if she got lost or\nhit by a car.''\n\n   A hidden fence may protect a dog that is prone to roam, but it\ndoes not necessarily protect strangers approaching the yard. The\ndog knows where the boundary is, Houpt said, but a visitor like a\nletter carrier may not know that there is a fence.\n\n   Bain also says that is a drawback of hidden fences. If a\nstranger steps into the yard, she said, the dog can become\naggressive because someone is in its territory. ``The aggression\ncan range from chasing them to biting them, depending on the dog,''\nshe said. ``We tell people with aggressive dogs to get a real\nfence,'' she added.\n\n   Hidden-fence companies can tailor their fences to the needs and\nquirks of individual dogs and owners. Most of the companies offer\ncollars with different shock levels, and the fences can also be\nused to protect flowerbeds or pools. Invisible Fence has a\nthree-sided wire system for lakefront properties.\n\n   For owners who would rather not shock their dogs, PetSafe has a\ncollar that emits a spray of citronella instead; most dogs do not\nlike the smell. PetSafe also offers a wireless product that keeps\nthe dog in a 90-foot radius around the transmitter.\n\n   Some dogs can outsmart a hidden fence. They have figured out\nthat if they stand near the boundary wire to trigger the beep, the\nbattery will eventually run out and they can come and go without a\nshock. In December, PetSafe will introduce a collar that is\ndesigned to discourage escapees by progressively increasing the\nintensity of the shock as the dog approaches the fence.\n\n   Dogs can sometimes be shocked even when they are on good\nbehavior because of interference by television signals. DogWatch\nhas switched from the standard AM radio signal to a more precise FM\nsignal for its transmitters to avoid that problem.\n\n   Still, no matter what the companies come up with, some dogs\nwon't stay put _ a squirrel or a cat across the street can become\njust too enticing. ``It is always better to have the dog in the\nhouse unless you can walk it on a leash,'' Houpt said. ``Yes, it's\ntrue a dog needs exercise, but probably so does its owners.''\n","Headline":"\nHIDDEN ELECTRONIC FENCES CAN KEEP DOGS FROM GOING ASTRAY \n","Text":["\n   No amount of scolding, begging or foot-stomping will keep most\ndogs home in their yards and out of the streets.
