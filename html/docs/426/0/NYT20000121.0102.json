A raid\non a tannery in Deux Sevres in western France discovered 1,500 cat\nskins, which were being used to make baby's shoes.\n\n   Anne Vesgien, a cat lover who is herself a magistrate and\npresident of an association which campaigns for a better legal\nstatus for pets in France and other EU countries, said: ``These\noffenses are more and more common and can lead to acts of torture\nand terrible acts of barbarity, even if many people seem to find\nthe whole thing funny.\n\n   ``We move heaven and earth for a stolen car or painting but, in\nthese cases, nothing is done.''\n\n   A Socialist member of parliament and veterinarian, Genevieve\nPerrin-Gaillard, is to press for new tougher laws on the\nidentification of cats and dogs in France in an attempt to give\npolice and judicial authorities more weapons against pet rustlers.\n\n   Under a 1989 law, all cats and dogs have to be tattooed with\ntheir identity before they can be sold, or given to another person,\nbut this law has proved impossible to enforce.\n\n   One bereaved cat owner in Toulouse told the newspaper, Le\nFigaro: ``A neighbor saw a white car stop in front of our house. A\nyoung woman with rubber gloves caught my cat in a sheet and then\nshoved it into a basket. The car drove away quickly... since then\nwe can only imagine the worst.''\n\n   The Societe pour la Protection des Animaux _ the French\nequivalent of the SPCA _ says that it has been inundated with\nreports of stolen cats from all corners of France. Some have simply\nstrayed from home but the organization puts the number of\nsuspicious cases at at least 20,000 a year and rising.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 400-word article from THE INDEPENDENT newspaper in\nLondon, it must be purchased from the New York Times Syndicate's\nsales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or fax her at\n732-390-4697.
