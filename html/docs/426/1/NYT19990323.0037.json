They're matter-of-fact even when showing you\nfaded photos of buddies who didn't come home.\n\n   But ask them about the war dogs that saved their lives and you\nsee the hard emotion that time can't wear away.\n\n   ``Whatever we did was nothing,'' says retired Army Maj. Paul\nMorgan. ``What the dogs did was everything. The dogs had such\nunconditional love. Suzie saved my butt several times. I can't\nbelieve how totally devoted she was.''\n\n   Suzie. Duchess. Jet. Crypto. Many were family pets, German\nshepherds and Labrador retrievers, sent to war by patriotic owners.\n\n   ``They saved lives and they gave us great confidence and\nboldness,'' says Morgan, who lives in Jupiter, Fla. and has written\na book, K-9 Soldiers _ Vietnam and After, due out in April.\n\n   Morgan, who served two Vietnam tours, estimates that the\n58,000-plus U.S. soldiers killed would have been ``well over 75,000\nwithout the dogs.''\n\n   There were about 10,000 dog handlers and more than 4,000 dogs\nused in Vietnam from 1966 to '75. Dogs have been used by the\nmilitary since the Civil War. But the animals proved invaluable in\nVietnam because it was a guerrilla jungle war. The enemy, capable\nof living and fighting from underground, had a huge home-field\nadvantage.\n\n   German shepherds were used as sentries and to scout ahead of\nU.S. troops. Labs proved exceptional for tracking, even able to\nwarn of enemy soldiers underwater, breathing through hollow bamboo\npoles.\n\n   Both breeds could take the heat and humidity and, unlike\nbloodhounds, could be taught not to bark. The dogs used human scent\nto warn of danger and could even hear wind pass over a booby trap\ntrip wire as thin as a human hair.\n\n   ``If I pulled point as much as I did without a dog, I wouldn't\nbe here talking about it,'' says Bob Azzaro. ``I never walked into\nan ambush. I always had enough warning because of Duchess.''\n\n   Azzaro, a West Palm Beach auto mechanic, was one of the first 28\ndog handlers trained and sent to Vietnam. He arrived in 1966 with\nhis German shepherd scout dog, Duchess.\n\n   ``Scout dogs were a pre-warning device,'' says Morris Huggins,\n``and you knocked on wood every time you went on a mission that\neverything worked out right. The dog worked, you worked, the\ntraining worked.''\n\n   Huggins, 51, owns a Delray Beach construction business. As a\nsergeant, his five-man tracking unit always had a scout or tracking\ndog walking point about 50 yards ahead of the unit to warn of\nambush or booby traps.\n\n   ``Booby traps are meant to maim and injure because for every one\nman injured it takes five to six men to take care of him,''\nexplains Huggins. ``And the psychology of a booby trap is to\ndemoralize you. One minute you're walking along and you're fine,\nand the next minute half your body's gone.\n\n   ``The scout dogs served a purpose psychologically, especially\nwith the dog handler,'' he continues. ``The dog gives you an\nadvantage only to the extent that if he picks up on something, he\ncan give you that split second as a handler to do whatever you've\ngot to do to cover your ass and get down, get cover, whatever.''\n\n   War dogs suffered infections and combat fatigue just like the\nmen they protected.\n\n   ``You'd have dogs go bad mentally,'' says Huggins. ``He'd become\na biter, he'd lose his cool. You'd either turn him into a blood\ndonor for other dogs or you'd destroy him. Those are the only two\nchoices you had.''\n\n   Azzaro saw a change in Duchess after the team graduated from 12\nweeks of training at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1966.\n\n   ``When we arrived in-country she was docile,'' he recalls, ``but\nher personality changed. She got into it. When she saw me going for\nthat harness, for her, it was a game. They're in it for the praise.\nShe picked up on life or death real fast.''\n\n   The war dogs were so effective that the Viet Cong offered a kill\nreward. ``The bounty was that either they came back with (the\ndog's) tattooed ear or came back with one of our (dog handler's)\ninsignia patches,'' Huggins said.\n\n   ``If they could take out a dog and handler,'' says Morgan,\n``they could bring the unit to a stop for days.''\n\n   Morgan and Huggins belong to the 1,000-member Vietnam Dog\nHandlers Association started in 1994. The group was instrumental in\nthe making of War Dogs, America's Forgotten Heroes, a documentary\nfilm that aired on the Discovery Channel.\n\n   The film couldn't have been made without the former dog\nhandlers, says Jeffrey Bennett, a dog breeder and founder and CEO\nof Nature's Recipe pet food.\n\n   Three years ago, Bennett took up the war-dog cause after he saw\na four-minute clip of Vietnam handlers talking about their dogs.\nBut the U.S. military kept no war-dogs records before 1969.\n\n   The Vietnam Dog Handlers Association, based in San Diego, filled\nin the blanks, Bennett says.\n\n   After making the $1.5 million film with GRB Entertainment,\nBennett planned two national war-dog memorials. The first will be\ndedicated on President's Day 2000 at Riverside National Cemetery\nnear Los Angeles. The second will be in Washington, D.C., by the\nend of 2000.\n\n   The 70-minute documentary uncovered a shocking fact. When the\nU.S. pulled out of Vietnam in April 1975, the dogs were left\nbehind.\n\n   ``Without being gross or mortifying to people, they were treated\nas surplus equipment,'' Bennett says.``We showed them (in the film)\npushing the helicopters off the aircraft carriers. The dogs were\nthe same thing, surplus equipment.\n\n   ``What's amazing to me,'' continues Bennett, ``is that the\ngovernment can push out $10 million tanks, $10 million helicopters\nlike they're a dime a dozen, and then they take these living,\nbreathing creatures and give them to the South Vietnamese, who ate\nthem or euthanized them because it was too inconvenient to bring\nthem home.\n\n   ``And any one of those handlers would have done just about\nanything to bring them home,'' he concludes.\n\n   Azzaro, 53, says a lot of post-traumatic stress syndrome\nsuffered by combat dog handlers comes because of guilt.\n\n   ``I know I can't get over leaving that dog behind,'' he says of\nDuchess.\n\n   But Morgan, 62, who started a K-9 private security service when\nhe left the military, says that the U.S. abandoned more than dogs.\n\n   ``We had no idea about the dogs,'' says Morgan, wounded and sent\nhome from Vietnam in 1970. ``But there were South Vietnamese people\nthat we said we'd never leave. We abandoned those people, our\nallies. A black page in our history. The dogs were the last thing\nwe thought about.\n\n   ``We soldiers are memorialized, we get parades, citations,''\nsays Morgan. ``But the dogs never got anything because they were\nall dead.''\n\n   Thirty years later, the war dogs are being remembered.
