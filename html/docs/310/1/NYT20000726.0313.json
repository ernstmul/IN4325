Times News Service  \n\n   Like many people, Tim Keck, the publisher of two weekly\nnewspapers in the Pacific Northwest, has come to depend on his cell\nphone.\n\n   And like many other cell phone users, he has begun to worry\nabout possible health risks connected with its use.\n\n   ``I'm sometimes scared my brain is getting boiled,'' said Keck,\nwhose newspaper in Seattle, The Stranger, is known for its jaded\nhumor.\n\n   ``But it's so convenient that I couldn't imagine not using it,''\nhe said, ``so I push these worries to the back of my mind.''\n\n   After several of the world's largest cell phone manufacturers,\nincluding companies like Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, said last\nweek that they planned to release more information on the radiation\nlevels of their devices, it will be harder to ignore the debate\nover health risks and mobile phones.\n\n   Even though federal agencies, relying on the results of various\nstudies, say cell phones are safe, it is not surprising that\nconcerns about the possible risks are increasing. Cell phones are\nemerging as perhaps the best-selling electronic device in the\nworld. More than 400 million units are expected to be sold this\nyear.\n\n   Much of the debate has to do with the amount of radiation\nemitted.\n\n   In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in\n1996 established a level of 1.6 watts per kilogram _ or 2.2 pounds\n_ of human tissue as the highest amount of radio waves a device can\nemit when held against a given part of the body.\n\n   Although devices currently available meet the FCC standard,\nthere is a lot of confusion as to what the level means.\n\n   That has prompted the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, a\ngroup representing wireless companies, to provide more information\non what the watts per tissue level means on pamphlets inside each\npackage.\n\n   Additionally, manufacturers will offer information on the\npackages that let consumers know that the device has been approved\nby the FCC, and will list addresses of government and corporate Web\nsites that provide more information.\n\n   ``We found there is a great deal of misinformation out there, so\nour aim is to provide as much transparency as possible,'' said Tom\nWheeler, the president of the industry association, which is in\nWashington, D.C.\n\n   To be sure, the topic of cell phones and health risks can be\nconfusing. Almost all studies conducted have failed to show any\nconclusive evidence that cell phone use can cause cancer.\n\n   Still, a few studies have linked cell phone use to the risk of\nbrain cancer in laboratory animals. One study showed that mice\ngenetically predisposed to a type of cancer developed twice as many\nsuch cancers when exposed to cell phone radiation.\n\n   Not surprisingly, all sides in the debate have called for\nadditional research. The industry association recently said it\nwould spend $25 million to study possible cancer risks from cell\nphones.\n\n   In light of recent rulings against tobacco companies, phone\nmanufacturers may be able to shield themselves from the possibility\nof future legal action if they can show that they have tried to\nmake users aware of any information related to radiation levels and\ncell phones.\n\n   ``It is simply smart for the companies to show they've done\neverything possible to ensure their devices are safe,'' said\nMitchell Lazarus, a lawyer at Fletcher, Heald & Hindreth in\nArlington, Va., which specializes in telecommunications law.\n\n   There are skeptics regarding the safety of cell phones.\n\n   Most of these people point to the need to conduct long-term\nresearch, since cell phones have only been available on a\nwidespread basis since the 1980s.\n\n   ``On numerous occasions, microwave radiation from sources\nsimilar to cellular phones has been showed to increase the chances\nof cancer,'' said C. Ross Adey, a former professor of physiology at\nthe Loma Linda School of Medicine. ``It is far too early in the\ngame to say that cell phones are the harmless little objects the\nindustry makes them out to be.''\n\n   In the meantime, anyone concerned with the potential health\nrisks can take several steps to lessen the possibility of cancer,\nhowever distant it may be.\n\n   Earphones can keep the phone away from the brain, although it\ncould expose a different part of the body to radiation.\n\n   Or, cell phone users could simply opt to have shorter\nconversations, which would lower their exposure to radio waves.\nThere are also a increasing number of shields being sold that are\ndesigned to protect the user from radiation, although some critics\nsay the shields might actually increase exposure because some\nphones may need more radio-frequency energy to communicate with\nnearby towers.\n\n   As for comparing the radiation levels of each phone,\nmanufacturers and scientists seem to agree that this is somewhat of\na useless exercise since the amount of radiation emitted can wary\nwidely depending on where the device is used.\n\n   For example, a cell phone used in Manhattan could have a higher\nradiation level because more energy is needed to communicate with a\ntower given the interference from buildings.\n\n   But even in these situations, the devices are below the FCC\nlimit of 1.6 watts per kilogram of human tissue, according to the\nCellular Telephone Industry Association.\n\n   In fact, Wheeler, the head of the manufacturers' association,\nsaid, few devices reach that level because it was established with\na 50-fold margin of error and the energy they need rarely reaches\nthat threshold.\n\n   ``We stand behind scientific consensus that no health risks have\nbeen demonstrated,'' said Norman Sandler, director of global\nstrategic issues at Motorola. ``But we support the need for more\nresearch into the matter.''\n","Headline":"\nAS CELL PHONE USE EXPLODES, DEBATE OVER HEALTH RISK GROWS\n","Text":["\n   Like many people, Tim Keck, the publisher of two weekly\nnewspapers in the Pacific Northwest, has come to depend on his cell\nphone.\n","\n   And like many other cell phone users, he has begun to worry\nabout possible health risks connected with its use.\n","\n   ``I'm sometimes scared my brain is getting boiled,'' said Keck,\nwhose newspaper in Seattle, The Stranger, is known for its jaded\nhumor.\n","\n   ``But it's so convenient that I couldn't imagine not using it,''\nhe said, ``so I push these worries to the back of my mind.''\n","\n   After several of the world's largest cell phone manufacturers,\nincluding companies like Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, said last\nweek that they planned to release more information on the radiation\nlevels of their devices, it will be harder to ignore the debate\nover health risks and mobile phones.\n","\n   Even though federal agencies, relying on the results of various\nstudies, say cell phones are safe, it is not surprising that\nconcerns about the possible risks are increasing.
