Carlo, put those\nconcerns more strongly, saying, ``The industry should stop saying\ncell phones are safe without qualification when there is no proof\nthey are and give consumers all the information so they can make\nintelligent choices.''\n\n   The FDA announced last week that it had signed a letter of\nintent with the cellular industry association to look into a\npossible collaborative project to follow up on clues from the\nearlier program. ``We want to see if researchers can replicate and\nexplain some findings from work previously done by Wireless\nTechnology Research,'' said Sharon Snider, an FDA spokeswoman.\n\n   The agency said these findings needed further attention:\n\n   _ A hospital study that compared brain cancer patients and a\nsimilar group without brain cancer found no statistically\nsignificant association between cell-phone use and a group of brain\ncancers known as glioma.
