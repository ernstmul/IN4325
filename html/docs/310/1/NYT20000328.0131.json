He's had a cool relationship with the industry ever since.\n\n   When he first started the cell phone research project in 1993,\nCarlo expected the studies would show that cell phones were\nperfectly safe.\n\n   ``I really didn't think we'd find anything,'' he said.\n\n   That's because it had been widely assumed cell phones couldn't\ncause health problems in humans because the phones operated at such\nlow power.\n\n   After he and CTIA went their separate ways, Carlo began working\nalmost full-time without pay to alert consumers about possible\nhealth effects from cell phones.\n\n   His organization published a half-inch thick consumer manual\ncalled ``Wireless Phones and Your Health,'' in which he concludes:\n``The science is in a gray area. Phones may or may not cause brain\ncancer. Most studies have found no connection, but enough have\nfound a connection that a potential cannot be ignored.''\n\n   One of the two studies that raised questions found an increased\nrisk of a rare brain tumor in people who used cell phones; the\nother study reported genetic damage in blood cells exposed to cell\nphone radiation.\n\n   Carlo cautions that the two studies don't necessarily mean cell\nphones are dangerous and that much more follow-up needs to be done.\n\n   Until then, he says consumers should take steps to protect\nthemselves by using a headset or ear phones to keep the device's\nantenna away from the user's head. With such an arrangement, the\nantenna and the cell phone are stashed in the user's pocket or on\nthe user's belt.\n\n   Since 1983, Carlo, 46, has run his own company _ currently known\nas Health Risk Management Group, of Washington, D.C. _ which\nresearches public health issues.
