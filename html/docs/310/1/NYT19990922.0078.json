They are\n``aginners,'' people who are against whatever they decide to be\nagainst.\n\n   Actually, I don't know when this coalition began _ it is secret,\nafter all. But I can easily envision a group of hand-wringing cave\npersons trying to throw cold water on the popular new invention of\na flint knife.\n\n   The argument would be that cave persons have gotten along just\nfine, thank you very much, with flat river rocks. Sharp rocks can\ncut and be used to hurt innocent cave persons. Sharp rocks could\nfall into the hands of cave children. In no time ``Ban Sharp\nRocks'' stickers could be seen on the clubs of the ancestors of\ntoday's aginners. Or something similar.\n\n   Over the millennia, this coalition of aginners has opposed\neverything from the use of fire to the use of cellular telephones.\n\n   Cell phones have been a popular technological advance. The\ndescendents of the cave persons who loved flint knives love their\ncell phones.\n\n   So naturally the coalition of aginners is trying to roll back\nthe clock to the heyday of human civilization _ when people huddled\nin the dark and suffered. Boy, those were the good old days.\n\n   The aginners first floated the junk science rumor that cell\nphones cause brain tumors. Junk science is a favorite tactic for\naginners.\n\n   Since it is difficult to prove a negative, it took time to\ndebunk the anti-cell phone brain-tumor tactic.\n\n   Meanwhile, the safety-nanny aginners switched to the threat to\nthe health and general welfare of society caused by people who use\ncell phones when they drive.\n\n   Using cell phones in cars is particularly disturbing to aginners\nwho opposed the invention of the horseless carriage in the first\nplace. They continue to fight to restrict the use of automobiles by\nlobbying for laws to slow cars down to a cave baby's crawl with\ngovernment restrictions and traffic laws.\n\n   A vocal group of aginners once argued for the government to ban\nradios in cars because the infernal devices could distract drivers\nfrom their driving duties.\n\n   Aginners who specialize in social arguments want to ban cell\nphone use in shopping malls, supermarkets, restaurants and other\npublic places. Since people normally talk in shopping malls,\nsupermarkets, restaurants and other public places, the aginners are\nreduced to arguing that it simply isn't proper to talk to someone\nwho either isn't present or isn't at the other end of endless miles\nof copper wire. Go figure.\n\n   I like my cell phone. I don't want the aginners to screw up a\ngood thing.\n\n   As long as I am not hurting anyone, no one should care if I talk\non my cell phone any more than if I talk to myself, an invisible\nblue marmoset or someone within arm's reach.\n\n   There also is no reason why I should be told where I can use my\ncell phone as long as it is where other people are allowed to carry\non conversations.\n\n   Admittedly, cell phone conversations should be discouraged in\nmovie theaters, libraries and other places where normal\nconversations are restricted.\n\n   Cell phones in cars are no more dangerous than drivers who eat\nBig Macs or drink designer water from car cup holders as they tool\ndown the road. Are we going to ban drive-through windows at\nfast-food establishments or outlaw conversations with passengers in\ncars? Don't ask the aginners. They might like the idea.\n\n   Rowland Nethaway writes for The Waco Tribune-Herald, Waco,\nTexas.
