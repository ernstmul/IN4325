By ERIC\nROSENBERG and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN   c.2000 Hearst\n\nNewspapers      WASHINGTON _ Federal safety regulators are\ninvestigating whether microwave radiation from cell phones causes\ncancer or other diseases.\n\n   The probe was triggered by two industry-sponsored studies that\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said require additional\nresearch.\n\n   The FDA hastens to add that there is no scientific basis for\nconcluding that cell phones are unsafe _ or that they are safe. The\nonly way to conclusively answer the safety question is through ``a\nsignificant research effort,'' the FDA says.\n\n   One study by researchers at the American Health Foundation in\nNew York found an association between cell phone use and a rare\ntype of brain tumor. The other study, conducted by Integrated\nLaboratory Systems in Research Triangle Park, N.C., found that DNA\nin human blood cells breaks down when exposed to large doses of\ncell phone radiation, possibly laying the genetic groundwork for\ncancer.\n\n   ``We are not sure what this means,'' said Dr. George Carlo, who\nheaded the industry's $27 million safety research project from 1993\nuntil last year. ``This could be a colossal coincidence or the tip\nof the iceberg,'' said Carlo, an epidemiologist and lawyer.\n\n   With 86 million cellular phone users in the United States alone\nand 30,000 new users signing up daily, ``this translates into a\npotentially significant public health problem, should the use of\nthese devices even slightly increase the risk of adverse health\neffects,'' the FDA says.\n\n   In the last year, the number of cell phone users in the United\nStates jumped by 10 million. U.S. cell phone sales soared over $37\nbillion in 1999, up $8 billion over the previous year and $12\nbillion over 1997.\n\n   The Carlo studies showing a possible link between the phones and\nillness have caught the attention of Peter Angelos, a prominent\nBaltimore attorney who has successfully litigated against the\ntobacco industry and asbestos manufacturers. Angelos is\ninvestigating possible legal action against the cellular phone\nindustry but cautions that more scientific research is needed.\n\n   The question of cell phone safety recently led Metrocall of\nAlexandria, Va., the nation's third largest pager company and a\nmajor seller of AT&T cellular phones, to warn its sales staff that\nparents buying for a child or young adult should consider a pager\ninstead of a cell phone ``due to potential health risks.''\n\n   The reason, said company officials, is concern that younger\npeople, whose bodies are still developing, may be more susceptible\nto damage from microwave radiation.\n\n   ``If an adult comes in with a teenager and says, `I want to buy\nmy kid a cell phone,' we say this is something that we want to make\nyou aware of,'' said Michael Scanlon, a senior vice president at\nMetrocall.\n\n   Carlo's cell phone research project _ which involved dozens of\nscientists at universities, hospitals and private laboratories\nacross the nation over a five-year period _ produced more than 40\nstudies.\n\n   While most of the research showed cell phone use had no effect\non the human body, Dr. Russell Owen, chief of the radiation-biology\nbranch of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health,\nsaid the two studies ``raise some interesting scientific questions\nbut are no cause for alarm.''\n\n   Much of the new safety research will be coordinated by the FDA\nand the cell phone industry represented by the Cellular\nTelecommunications Industry Association (CTIA). The first study\nwill follow-up the North Carolina research on DNA breakdown linked\nto cell phone radiation.\n\n   That is ``a priority goal,'' said Owen, because _ if the\nfindings are accurate _ such genetic damage could lead to cancer or\nother disorders.\n\n   The details of the new research program won't be released until\nlater this year. It is unclear how long it will take to complete.\nMeanwhile, the National Cancer Institute and the World Health\nOrganization are conducting separate studies on cell phone safety.\n\n   Questions about cell phone safety were first raised in 1993 when\na Florida man, David Reynard, filed suit against NEC Corp., a cell\nphone manufacturer, claiming his wife Suzy's fatal brain cancer was\ncaused by her cell phone.\n\n   His suit and 12 other suits against cell phone manufacturers\nhave been dismissed for lack of scientific proof, according to\nAngelos.\n\n   Public anxieties were further heightened by the brain cancer\ndeaths of two prominent business executives in 1994 and 1993,\nMichael Walsh, the chief executive officer of Tenneco, and Reginald\nLewis the CEO of TLC Beatrice. Both were cell phone users. At the\ntime, their illnesses sparked a sell off on Wall Street of wireless\nindustry stocks.\n\n   As a result of public concern, the CTIA decided to fund the $27\nmillion research project aimed at assuring consumers that cell\nphones are safe.\n\n   The industry association argues that cell phones are indeed\nsafe, despite the two studies that Carlo calls ``red flags.''\n\n   ``These are just pieces of a much larger picture, and the larger\npicture continues to reaffirm the fact that there are no adverse\nhealth effects from using cellular phones,'' said Jo-Anne Basile,\nCTIA's vice president for external and industry relations.\n\n   Cell phones use microwave signals to transmit human voice or\ndata. Microwaves _ a specific category of radio waves _ also have\nother applications, the most common of which is to cook food. The\nmajor difference between cell phones and microwave ovens is the\namount of power that propels the signal. Cell phones use low power,\nwhile ovens use high power.\n\n   High levels of microwave radiation are known to be dangerous. A\nmicrowave oven, for example, shoots a powerful microwave signal,\npropelled by 100 watts of power, at a piece of food and cooks it by\nheating its water molecules.\n\n   The key question is whether the low level of microwave radiation\nused by a cell phone _ a cell phone's microwave signal is propelled\nby about 0.6 watts of power _ also can cause harm.\n\n   Past research has shown no firm link between microwaves and\ncancer, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\n   ``While some epidemiological studies suggest associations with\ncancer, others do not, and experimental studies have not yet\nyielded reproducible evidence of carcinogenic mechanisms,'' ACS\nsaid.\n\n   The cell phone's radiation field is concentrated at about three\nto four inches around the antenna, near the user's head.\n\n   And this is where the potential problems lie.\n\n   Current FDA rules on cell phone safety rely on a radiation\nmeasurement called the ``specific absorption rate'' or SAR.\n\n   Cell phones are allowed to emit a maximum SAR of 1.6 watts per\nkilogram as measured over one gram of body tissue.\n\n   However, the FDA now questions whether that safety limit fully\nprotects consumers. The limit is focused entirely on protecting a\nuser from phones that actually destroy cells by heating them, the\n``thermal'' effect.\n\n   This limit may not protect against ``any non-thermal effects of\nchronic exposure,'' the agency said. DNA disintegration is an\nexample of a non-thermal effect.\n\n   The 1.6 watt SAR was set in 1996 from the previous limit of 8\nwatts, following a recommendation from the Institute of Electrical\nand Electronics Engineers _ a professional association.\n\n   The 8-watt ceiling had been considered safe. But the group\nproposed reducing the ceiling, which was first established in 1982\nto govern two-way radios,\n\n   by a factor of five to ensure that there would be no health\neffects caused by cell phone use.\n\n   Against this background, the North Carolina researchers at\nIntegrated Laboratory Systems were surprised to find cell damage\nwhen tissue was exposed to radiation of 5 and 10-watts per kilogram\nover a period of 24 hours.\n\n   Researchers found no problems when blood cells were exposed to\nradiation of 1 watt per kilogram over a period of 24 hours. They\nalso found no damage when blood cells were exposed for three hours\nat 1, 2.5, 5 and 10-watts per kilogram of radiation.\n\n   In other words, problems appeared when blood was exposed to\nhigher levels of radiation over longer periods of time.\n\n   What had previously been considered safe now appeared to pose\nsome risk. This led to the conclusion that no one knew exactly what\nis a safe level of radiation for human exposure.\n\n   One of the authors of the study, Dr. Graham Hook, said the\nresults don't necessarily mean the phones are harmful if they\noperate below 5- and 10-watts per kilogram for short periods.\n\n   The American Health Foundation used a different kind of\nscientific tool known as case control studies. In still-unpublished\npreliminary findings, the researchers compared the cell phone\nexposure of a group of people with a particular health problem with\nanother group of people who did not have the condition.\n\n   One study compared the cell phone habits of 465 patients newly\ndiagnosed with brain cancer against a group of 422 non-cell phone\nusers who did not have the disease. They found no association\nbetween overall brain cancer risk and cell phone usage.\n\n   But when the researchers looked at a specific type of brain\ncancer _ known as neuronal tumors, which grow from the periphery of\nthe brain inward _ they found that 14 out of 34 patients with that\nkind of cancer were cell phone users. Compared with the control\ngroup, cell phone users had more than double the risk of developing\nthe tumor.\n\n   However, in a somewhat paradoxical finding, the researchers\nfound that the risk did not increase with the duration of cell\nphone use, which they would expect to occur with a carcinogen.\n\n   Joshua Muscat, the lead researcher on the study, called the\nfindings ``not a red flag, but a pale red flag.'' He said that the\nlink between phones and the rare brain tumor requires a larger\nstudy of larger populations of people.\n\n   Muscat also cautioned that the long-term health effects of cell\nphone radiation are unknown, adding that there is often a\ndecades-long latency period among certain types of cancers. ``To be\nprudent, surveillance is needed,'' he said.\n\n   Scientists from both research projects later briefed the FDA\nabout their findings. The agency then ordered the new round of\nsafety investigation.\n","Headline":"\n      FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS PROBE CELL PHONE SAFETY \n","Text":["\n   The probe was triggered by two industry-sponsored studies that\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said require additional\nresearch.\n","\n   The FDA hastens to add that there is no scientific basis for\nconcluding that cell phones are unsafe _ or that they are safe.
