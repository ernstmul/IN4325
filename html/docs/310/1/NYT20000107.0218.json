Times News Service   \n\n   When the Crowbar club opened in Miami last week, so many people\nin the crowd milling around outside were wired into their cell\nphones that ``it looked like some sort of commando operation was\nabout to be enacted,'' said Tom Austin, who writes about night life\nfor Ocean Drive magazine in Miami Beach. ``I swear there were,\nlike, 14,000 cell phones,'' he continued, ``and guys were talking\ninto their shirts, trying to call the owner of the club to get in.\nThose headset things have become the weirdest accessory down\nhere.''\n\n   Lana Bernstein, a colleague of Austin's, reported that at an\nOcean Drive staff meeting, wires were hanging from everybody's\nears. ``It's quite a look,'' she said, ``especially when they leave\nthe meeting and start talking to themselves and waving their hands\naround.''\n\n   In New York City, the public use of cell phone headsets hasn't\nquite reached Miami levels yet, but the sets are poised to become\nthe big accessory for spring _ more useful on the head than a bra\nstrap, and more attractive.\n\n   Have you seen these things? They are little wires hanging from\nearplugs, and together with a microphone that clips to your shirt\nthey relay conversations to and from a cell phone stashed in a\npocket. Why? To a certain degree, because people are worried about\nbrain tumors. My friend Bob has been talking about the boiled egg\ntrick for weeks now.\n\n   ``They put an egg between two cell phones and in a few minutes.\n. . .'' He pauses dramatically. ``In a few minutes the egg has\nboiled!'' You will not be able to duplicate these results at home;\ncell phones don't really boil eggs. But you might take note, as Bob\nand others have, of the genesis of the egg myth, which is rooted in\nincreasing uneasiness about the health effects of cellular phone\nuse. Or you might just respond, as I did, by pointing out that the\negg didn't get cancer, so why worry?\n\n   The fuss over cell phones and brain tumors, which has been\npresent in some form almost since the phones' invention, traces to\nthe fact that their antennae emit radiation, or microwaves, which\nis how they find and receive signals from network beacons. Recent\nnews reports have stirred a new round of jumpiness over the idea of\nmicrowaves pouring into peoples' heads, and thus the craze in some\ncities for headsets, which allow the phones to be somewhere other\nthan next to the ear.\n\n   No studies directly link cell phone use to brain cancer. But all\nsorts of weird data is accumulating, said Dr. George L. Carlo, a\nlawyer with a Ph.D. in pathology, who was hired by the wireless\nphone industry's trade association to head up research in the area.\nLast fall Dr. Carlo broke ranks with the industry, announcing that\nstudy results he had marshaled from around the world added up to\none big question mark. He has scolded cell phone makers for saying\ntheir technology is safe without qualification, and urges further\ninvestigation.\n\n   In late November, the ABC News program ``20/20'' broadcast a\nreport detailing tests that it said were independently conducted\nand measured the amount of radiation that penetrated the head from\ndifferent cell phone models being used in different positions.\nRadiation from four of the five phones tested exceeded a Federal\nCommunications Commission guideline in at least one position in\nanalog mode, ``20/20'' said, except when headsets were used.\n\n   The wireless telecommunications industry quickly denounced the\n``20/20'' methodology, along with Dr. Carlo's apostasy, but by then\nmany people had jumped to their own conclusions. Publicists,\nHollywood agents, rap stars and other cell phone abusers bought\nheadsets by the carload, and the public areas of certain cities\nbegan to look like the grounds of an old-fashioned mental\ninstitution, its inmates pacing and frantically gesturing, all\nengaged in heated conversation with . . . themselves. Or so it\nseemed to the rest of us.\n\n   The latest headsets, which hook behind the ear, are a logical\nevolution from an earlier look, the headband headset with a\nmicrophone arm, worn by Madonna during her ``Blond Ambition'' tour,\nas well as by the actors in most Broadway musicals, N.F.L. coaches\nand the sales folk in Gap stores.\n\n   Now, walking around with discreet wires trailing from their\nears, whole segments of the citizenry seem to be auditioning for a\n``Mission: Impossible'' sequel. ``It was the whole thing of `I can\nbe a secret agent,''' said Megan Matthews, a spokeswoman for Nokia,\nthe giant cell phone maker. ``All of a sudden you saw people in\nairports talking to themselves. We've been making headsets for\nabout four years; this is not a new thing for us.''\n\n   Ms. Matthews said sales of headsets have been steady since their\nintroduction, which was ``an extension of the whole personalization\nthing and the convenience factor'' and had nothing to do with\nperceived health risks. People want their hands free while talking\non a cell phone. ``The `20/20' show had no effect on our\nbusiness,'' she said. ``Today there is no reason for concern.''\n\n   Gavin Polone, a talent manager and producer in Hollywood who\nstarted using a headset about three months ago, called from his car\nto talk about it. ``I produced two movies in one month last year,\nand I was talking on my cell phone constantly,'' he said. ``Maybe\nit was psychosomatic, but I had headaches all the time. Anyway,\nit's just easier to do other things, like drive, with a headset.''\n\n   Headset prices range from about $30 to $70. Cellwest.com sells a\nclear plastic one that lights up when you have a call. As with any\nhot consumer product, selling accessories to go with it is a smart\nbusiness move. This would seem especially true with cell phones,\nwhich, like the Nasdaq stock index, have had a giddy rise.\n\n   There are more than 70 million cell phone subscribers in the\ncountry, and counting. Clearly, no one is going to stop talking.\nNow companies like Wavelength Technologies are making cell phone\nsheaths designed to absorb the radiation emitted by both the phone\nand its antenna. Made of leather, wire mesh and PVC laminate, among\nother things, the Microshield sheath costs $59 and is available at\nwww.wavelengthonline.com.\n\n   What's the appeal? Well, consider that you've bought a headset,\nbut while you use it, your cell phone is shoved into a hip or\nbreast pocket, theoretically pumping microwaves into some other,\nmore vulnerable part of your body. ``I mean, at least your head is\ncovered by your skull,'' said Kimberly Thier, who leases commercial\nreal estate in Manhattan and was ``totally freaked out last month\nby the `20/20' thing.'' Ms. Thier and her friends are all using the\nMicroshield. ``Everywhere I go,'' she said, ``people are asking me\nabout it. I'm not into this health stuff, but for me it's a win-win\nthing.''\n\n   With your hands free while using a headset, what else might you\ndo? How about going online? Ms. Matthews of Nokia said one big\ntrend for her company was wireless and Internet combinations, so\nthat now you can buy a phone with a built-in Web browser.\n\n   ``Pervasive computing'' is the buzz phrase for such activity,\nsaid Michael Wolff, author of ``Burnrate: How I Survived the Gold\nRush Years on the Internet'' (Simon & Schuster). ``Also, digital\nassistants,'' he added. ``That is, those devices you surround\nyourself with to put you into even closer touch with the\ninformation flow. It's about intense wireless abilities, so you can\nget your e-mail basically pumped into your head.''\n\n   But can e-mail boil an egg?\n","Headline":"\nFEARING RADS, CELL ADDICTS SPROUT WIRES \n","Text":["\n   When the Crowbar club opened in Miami last week, so many people\nin the crowd milling around outside were wired into their cell\nphones that ``it looked like some sort of commando operation was\nabout to be enacted,'' said Tom Austin, who writes about night life\nfor Ocean Drive magazine in Miami Beach. ``I swear there were,\nlike, 14,000 cell phones,'' he continued, ``and guys were talking\ninto their shirts, trying to call the owner of the club to get in.\nThose headset things have become the weirdest accessory down\nhere.''\n","\n   Lana Bernstein, a colleague of Austin's, reported that at an\nOcean Drive staff meeting, wires were hanging from everybody's\nears. ``It's quite a look,'' she said, ``especially when they leave\nthe meeting and start talking to themselves and waving their hands\naround.''\n","\n   In New York City, the public use of cell phone headsets hasn't\nquite reached Miami levels yet, but the sets are poised to become\nthe big accessory for spring _ more useful on the head than a bra\nstrap, and more attractive.\n","\n   Have you seen these things?
