Times News Service    \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 19:\n\n   There was a lot of debate about the safety implications of car\nradios when they were developed over 70 years ago. A similar debate\nis under way now about the use of hand-held cell phones in cars. On\nthe face of it, cell phones are a much bigger potential distraction\nthan radios. They require more concentration by the driver and tie\nup one hand that ought to be on the steering wheel.\n\n   A few small American municipalities, most recently Marlboro,\nN.J., have banned the use of hand-held cell phones by drivers.\nWhile the matter may require more research, our instinct is that\nMarlboro and the other communities are on the right track. We would\ngo so far as to recommend state legislation to guarantee\nuniformity.\n\n   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began public\nhearings yesterday on cell phone use in cars. There are 91 million\nmobile phone subscribers, and 85 percent of them say they\noccasionally talk on their phones while driving. The potential for\ndistraction, even disaster, is obvious. A 1997 Canadian study\npublished in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the\nrisk of an accident increases fourfold if the driver is on a cell\nphone. But it cautioned that the findings suggest an association,\nnot a causal relationship.\n\n   Few state or local governments tabulate statistics on cell phone\nuse as a factor in traffic accidents. They should start doing so. A\nstatistical analysis persuaded Japanese government officials that\ncell phones were in fact responsible for traffic violations and\naccidents and ultimately led to a ban. Congress could usefully\nunderwrite similar studies in this country.\n\n   One technological answer could be hands-free or voice-activated\ncell phones, which are growing in popularity. But the Canadian\nstudy suggested that these phones do not confer a safety advantage\nover hand-held units.\n\n   So far 13 countries, including Britain, Italy and Australia,\nhave banned cell phone use while driving. That is not reason enough\nto ban them here. But common sense suggests that the matter\ndeserves, at the very least, serious and comprehensive study, aimed\nnot at delaying action but promoting a sensible response.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: CELL PHONES AND SAFETY \n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 19:\n","\n   There was a lot of debate about the safety implications of car\nradios when they were developed over 70 years ago.
