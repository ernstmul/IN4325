Times News Service    \n\n   How often has your clock radio awakened you with the distressing\nnews that something you eat, drink, breathe or do has just been\nshown in a new study to be a serious health hazard? And how often\ndid it turn out to be a false alarm, unsupported by subsequent\nresearch?\n\n   The American Council on Science and Health, based in New York,\nrecently updated and expanded its popular report, ``Facts Versus\nFears,'' reviewing what it considers the greatest unfounded health\nscares of the last five decades. Although controversy continues to\nrage about potential risks associated with some of these\n``scares,'' including Agent Orange and hormones in beef, most _\nincluding those that resulted in serious economic damage and\nchanges in public policy _ have been soundly discounted by\nsubsequent studies.\n\n   The following review of some of the most prominent scares in\nrecent decades serves as a cautionary tale that should help you\nrealize why it is unwise to leap before you look more closely at\nwhat any new study actually means.\n\n   ALAR _ In 1989, the popular television show ``60 Minutes,'' the\nNatural Resources Defense Council and the actress Meryl Streep\ndenounced this chemical used to regulate the ripening of apples as\n``the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply'' and\nsaid it was a cause of childhood cancer.\n\n   The accusation was based on a 1973 study in which a byproduct of\nAlar caused tumors in mice. The dosage used in the study was eight\ntimes greater than the so-called maximum tolerated dose, the amount\nabove which tissue damage occurs even from innocent substances\nbecause of the high concentration.\n\n   Subsequent tests by the National Cancer Institute and the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency failed to show that Alar caused\ncancer. Only when mice were given extremely high doses, equivalent\nto 133,000 to 266,000 times the amount a preschool child might\nconsume in a day in apples and apple juice, did any tumors result.\n\n   Still, millions of alarmed parents panicked and dumped untold\ngallons of apple juice and bushels of apples, the apple industry\nlost about $375 million, the Department of Agriculture lost another\n$15 million, countless children were given far less nutritious\ndrinks in place of apple juice and Alar was taken off the market by\nits manufacturer.\n\n   COFFEE AND PANCREATIC CANCER _ In 1981 in The New England\nJournal of Medicine, Harvard researchers published an\n``unexpected'' finding linking pancreatic cancer to coffee\nconsumption. Just two cups of coffee a day doubled the risk and\nfive cups tripled it, said the researchers, who estimated that\ncoffee accounted for more than half the cases of this nearly\nuniversally fatal cancer.\n\n   But the study was designed to look not at coffee but at alcohol\nand smoking as factors in this cancer, and other researchers who\nhad been studying huge numbers of people had found no such link to\ncoffee. Nor did animal studies disclose any association between\ncoffee and pancreatic cancer. Five years later, the Harvard group\nrepeated its study and failed to confirm its own findings.\n\n   In ``Facts Versus Fears,'' the council stated, ``This brief\nscare illustrates the danger of putting too much credence in a\nsingle study without analyzing any possible biases or confounding\nfactors.''\n\n   ELECTRIC BLANKETS _ Everyone in modern societies is exposed to\nelectromagnetic fields (EMF's) _ at home, at work and everywhere\nthat electricity is in use. A 1979 report hinted at a possible\nrelationship between childhood cancer and living near high-current\nresidential power lines, and subsequently, electric blankets were\nsingled out as possible risks, because of their nightlong proximity\nto the body.\n\n   In 1990, a study found a modest increase in cancers in children\nwhose mothers had used electric blankets during pregnancy and a\nlesser increase in children who had used such blankets.\n\n   This prompted a warning label on all electric blankets and a\nredesign of the product that reduced EMF exposure to the background\nlevel produced by household wiring.\n\n   But subsequent studies have not borne out the 1990 finding, and\nthis year a large National Cancer Institute study concluded that a\ncausal relationship between childhood brain tumors and EMF's from\nappliances, including electric blankets, was unlikely. Other\nstudies that examined several adult cancers also found no\nrelationship to the use of electric blankets.\n\n   CELLULAR PHONES _ Like electric blankets, cell phones create\nEMF's. In 1990, a woman who had used a cell phone extensively for\ntwo years developed a brain tumor just behind her right ear, where\nshe typically placed the phone's antenna.\n\n   Her husband filed suit against the manufacturer, saying that the\nphone's EMF's had caused his wife's cancer. In 1993 he appeared on\nthe CNN program ``Larry King Live'' to proclaim his assertion,\nwhich prompted three lawsuits from other cell phone users making\nsimilar claims.\n\n   In response, the industry paid for independent safety studies,\nwhich have yet to clearly link cell phones to cancer. Although it\nis not possible to prove that EMF's are safe, there is still no\nconvincing evidence of harm from the kind of EMF's that cell phones\nemit. While the incidence of brain tumors has risen slightly in\nrecent years, there has been no disproportionate increase in tumors\nnear the ears, despite a meteoric rise in cell phone use.\n\n   As the council points out in its report, by far the most serious\nhazard associated with these phones is their use while driving.\nLast year a study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine\nshowed that drivers who use cell phones are four times as likely as\nnonusers to have an accident.\n\n   ASBESTOS IN SCHOOLS _ Asbestos that is contained in a solid\nsubstance is harmless. But when it becomes crumbly, airborne and\ninhaled, it can lodge in body tissues, where it can sometimes cause\ncancer. Asbestos insulation to protect against fire was required in\nschools until 1973, when the Environmental Protection Agency banned\nits use to reduce children's exposure. The 1980s produced two\nCongressional acts requiring schools to inspect for asbestos\nhazards and clean them up. Despite the fact that in most schools\nasbestos levels were extremely low (less than the amount that in 10\nyears of exposure might cause one additional death in 100,000 over\na lifetime _ one-third the risk of being struck by lightning), by\n1990 some $6 billion had been spent on asbestos abatement in\nschools.\n\n   Many experts believe that asbestos removal, which increased\nairborne asbestos, created a far greater hazard to the children,\nwho might have benefited far more had this money been spent on\nenhancing their education.\n\n   Â \n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: HEALTH SCARES THAT WEREN'T SO SCARY  \n (JT) \n","Text":["\n   How often has your clock radio awakened you with the distressing\nnews that something you eat, drink, breathe or do has just been\nshown in a new study to be a serious health hazard?
