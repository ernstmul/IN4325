BROAD    \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   A federal probe has found that a scientist at the Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., faked what had been\nconsidered key evidence of a tie between electromagnetic radiation\nand cancer. The disclosure appears to strengthen the case that\nelectric power is safe.\n\n   Robert P. Liburdy, a cell biologist at the laboratory, an arm of\nthe Energy Department, was found to have published two papers with\nmisleading data. Investigators said Liburdy eliminated data that\ndid not support his conclusions. After the investigation, he\nresigned quietly from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in March and\nhas agreed to withdraw his research findings.\n\n   Federal officials say his misrepresentations helped him win $3.3\nmillion in grants from the National Institutes of Health, the\nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Defense to investigate a\nlink between electric power and cancer.\n\n   Debate has raged for decades over whether power lines cause\ncancer even though top scientific groups such as the National\nAcademy of Sciences have repeatedly found no evidence of danger.\nBut other researchers say enough tantalizing clues keep emerging to\nwarrant further investigations of possible links between\nelectromagnetic radiation and killer diseases, sowing seeds of\nanxiety among people living near high-tension power lines.\n\n   ``If he hadn't gotten these results, nobody would have paid any\nattention,'' a federal investigator in the case, who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity, said Friday.\n\n   The two papers reported data indicating that electromagnetic\nfields, also known as EMF, exert a biological effect by altering\nthe entry of calcium across a cell's surface membrane. The fields\nare ubiquitous forms of radiation that arise from all power lines,\nhome wiring and computers.\n\n   Federal officials say Liburdy's claims were potentially very\nimportant when published in 1992 because they purported to link\nelectromagnetic fields to calcium signaling, which is a fundamental\nprocess governing many important cellular functions.\n\n   ``When he originally published these papers, there was quite a\nbit of interest in it,'' said Woods. ``Now both the lab and the\nOffice of Research Integrity have found that data on which he based\nhis conclusions were fabricated. He's been asked to withdraw that\ndata, and I think he's doing that right now.''\n\n   As part of his federal settlement, Liburdy has agreed to make no\napplications for federal grants for three years and not to contest\nthe federal findings in administrative proceedings.\n\n   Liburdy can, however, disagree publicly with the misconduct\nfindings, and he is doing so vigorously, professing his innocence.\n\n   The ethics probe of Liburdy began after a whistle-blower\nchallenged his intriguing results. In July 1995, the Lawrence\nBerkeley Lab determined that Liburdy had indeed falsified data, and\nit alerted the Office of Research Integrity, an arm of the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n   Last month, the integrity office announced its findings in the\nFederal Register, saying Liburdy had ``engaged in scientific\nmisconduct in biomedical research by falsifying and fabricating\ndata and claims about the purported cellular effects of electric\nand magnetic fields.''\n\n   Recently, in letters sent over the Internet to scientific\ncolleagues and interested parties, Liburdy has denied that his\nresearch is wrong and said he agreed to the federal settlement only\nbecause he was unable to spend $1 million to mount a legal defense.\n\n   ``The raw data for these figures is not challenged, and is\nvalid,'' Liburdy wrote in one letter. ``How I graphed them is a\nmatter of disagreement among scientists. Independent scientists\nhave reviewed this for me and concluded that misconduct is not\nwarranted.''\n\n   He also stressed that ``none of my scientific conclusions in the\ntwo papers are being retracted,'' only the disputed published data.\n\n   Requests for further comments left Friday at Liburdy's residence\nin Tiburon, just north of San Francisco, went unanswered.\n\n   Federal experts vigorously disagree with Liburdy's defense and\nclaims of innocence.\n\n   ``This is not a matter of interpretation or graphing,'' said the\ninvestigator. ``This is fabrication and falsification. He can\nexpress his opinion, but not to an appeal board.''\n\n   In misconduct cases, especially ones involving large sums of\nmoney, the federal government can bring civil or criminal charges,\nand the defendant can be fined and sentenced to jail. In this case,\nofficials say, they concluded that an administrative remedy was\nsufficient.\n\n   The terms of the settlement with Liburdy are detailed in the\nJune 17 Federal Register. The notice says Liburdy ``neither admits\nor denies'' the finding of scientific misconduct.\n\n   Federal officials say Liburdy did not spend all of the $3.3\nmillion in grant money, and that the remainder is controlled by the\nLawrence Berkeley Lab.\n\n   ``It's being used for other science'' and none of it has been\nreturned to the federal government, Glenn R. Woods, the\nlaboratory's counsel, said Friday.\n\n   Liburdy's two disputed papers both appeared in 1992, and in both\ncases he was the lone author.\n\n   The paper, ``Biological interactions of cellular systems with\ntime-varying magnetic fields,'' appeared in the Annals of the New\nYork Academy of Sciences. ``Calcium signaling in lymphocytes in ELF\nfields'' appeared in FEBS Letters, published by the Federation of\nEuropean Biochemical Societies.\n\n   In the years since Liburdy's research appeared, more than 20\nstudies have found no hard evidence that electric power causes\ncancer, a National Institutes of Health panel concluded recently.\n\n   Robert L. Park, a professor of physics at the University of\nMaryland who has long questioned the power-cancer link, said\nLiburdy's deception was probably typical for the field, which he\nsaid seems to attract crusaders out to vilify industry.\n\n   ``It's often not deliberate fraud either,'' Park said of slanted\ndata. ``People are awfully good at fooling themselves. They're so\nsure they know the answer that they don't want to confuse people\nwith ugly-looking data.''\n\n   In the power line debate, Park added, the proponents of danger\n``were desperately looking for a physical effect, and the nearest\nthey could come by was the calcium signal.''\n\n   The growing consensus among researchers seems to be that\nelectric power is safe.\n\n   Two years ago, a large, meticulously designed study found no\nevidence that electromagnetic fields emanating from power lines\ncause leukemia in children. The study was a collaboration between\nscientists at the National Cancer Institute and childhood leukemia\nspecialists from the nation's leading medical centers.\n\n   The study involved 636 children with acute lymphoblastic\nleukemia, the most common childhood cancer, and 620 healthy\nchildren who were matched to the cancer patients by race, age and\nresidential neighborhood.\n\n   Scientists tracked the children's exposure to the fields that\npower lines produce, but found no relationship between exposure and\nrisk.\n\n   Park said the new findings of power-cancer misrepresentation\nwill aid the emerging consensuses on safety. ``But I'm not sure how\nstrongly,'' he added, as other scientists are still investigating\nand advancing the idea of a cancer linkage.\n","Headline":"\nSCIENTIST FAKED DATA LINKING CANCER TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS,\nPROBE FINDS \n","Text":["\n   A federal probe has found that a scientist at the Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., faked what had been\nconsidered key evidence of a tie between electromagnetic radiation\nand cancer.
