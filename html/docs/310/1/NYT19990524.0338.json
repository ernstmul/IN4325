HOWE  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Scientists studying links between cellular telephone use and\ncancer are furious that preliminary data were leaked from their\nresearch in a way that, they say, falsely suggested that the phones\nmay be linked to brain tumors.\n\n   In fact, investigators said Monday, the data show no clear link.\nSeveral people close to the situation said the consultant who\nreleased the information may have been trying to stir up fears to\nget millions of dollars more for himself or for associates to\ncontinue research.\n\n   The consultant, a George Washington faculty member, George\nCarlo, denied that he is looking for more business.\n\n   For years, studies have overwhelmingly disputed a cancer risk\nfrom the low-level electromagnetic energy of cell phones. But with\n70 million to 100 million Americans now using cell phones, any hint\nof danger attracts intense political and scientific interest.\n\n   A story distributed Friday by The Washington Post, and which was\npublished in Saturday's Globe under the headline ``Study suggests\ncell phones tied to cancer,'' cited ``possible connections''\nbetween cell-phone use and cancer. It used a statistical study\nexamining rates of a rare brain cancer called neurocytoma, as well\nas a laboratory study.\n\n   The work was overseen by a Washington consulting firm, Wireless\nTechnology Research LLC, under a six-year, $27 million contract\nexpiring next month that was funded by a blind trust established by\ncellular industry companies. The trust arrangement was aimed at\nenhancing the studies' credibility.\n\n   The consulting firm, chaired by Carlo, a lawyer and\npublic-health specialist on the George Washington University\nfaculty, hired scientists led by Dr. Joshua Muscat, a widely\npublished New York epidemiologist, for a ``case-control'' study.\n\n   Over the past five years, Muscat's group has compared 450 people\nwith brain cancer to a control group of 450 others. Carlo said in\nan interview Monday that Muscat's findings suggest a nearly tripled\nrisk of a brain cancer called neurocytoma among cell-phone users.\n\n   ``The whole thing is a gray area,'' Carlo said. ``No one _\nmyself included _ believes that these findings rise to the level of\na public health threat, but clearly there is a need for timely,\nfollow-on research.''\n\n   But one of the investigators working with Muscat, Dr. Michael\nHuncharek, director of Meta-Analysis Research Group in Columbia,\nS.C. and a radiology professor at the University of South Carolina\nMedical Center, said: ``There is no more study needed on this\nissue. There really was no association found between cell phone use\nand the development of primary brain tumors.''\n\n   Huncharek, a Boston University Medical School graduate who\ntrained at Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ``This is grossly\nirresponsible to release something like this. It's going to hit the\nindustry hard, it's going to scare people, and in academia, doing\nsomething like this would get you fired.''\n\n   Muscat, the principal investigator, who is with the American\nHealth Foundation in New York, said, ``The results that are quoted\nby other sources really don't have much credence.''\n\n   ``It's just not appropriate'' for any data to be publicized yet,\nMuscat said, especially not an ``isolated finding that's taken out\nof context.'' And he voiced fear that the early publicity would\nruin chances of publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal for\nthe study, which is still a month from completion.\n\n   The indication of increased neurocytoma from cell-phone usage,\ninvestigators said, hinges on a single New York University\nneuropathologist whose diagnoses many other physicians dispute.\n\n   Others theorize that those cases were in fact a far more common\nkind of brain cancer called astrocytoma, Huncharek said. Muscat\nsaid only that ``there's ambiguity'' about the diagnoses.\n\n   If those cases are in fact the more common astrocytoma, the data\nwould show no statistically significant increased risk of brain\ntumors among cell-phone users, said Huncharek, who voiced outraged\nthat Carlo had released the data.\n\n   Carlo himself acknowledged that despite showing an apparently\nelevated risk of neurocytoma among cell-phone users, Muscat's\nresults also show the opposite of a ``dose-response'' effect: Rates\nof brain cancer were lower among people who spent more time on a\ncell phone, rather than higher.\n\n   However, Carlo opposed reconsidering or reclassifying the New\nYork cases as astrocytoma, saying that would be ``retrofitting the\ndata and would invalidate the study.'' He said he welcomes later\nscrutiny of the New York results. Some investigators say this step\nshould be taken before publication, not afterward.\n\n   Three Capitol Hill sources involved in the issue, who asked not\nto be named, said there might be other motivations. One of them\nsaid: ``Part of what might be going on here is Carlo looking for an\nextension on his research contract.''\n\n   But Carlo said that when his term as chairman of the group\nexpires next month, ``I'm not going to re-up. The future'' of\nWireless Technology Research ``is unclear. . . . When we complete\nour job, that's going to be it.''\n\n   Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association officials would\nnot comment directly, but in veiled criticism of Carlo's early\nrelease of data, the association president, Thomas Wheeler, said\nthe association ``welcomes independent, peer-reviewed scientific\ninquiry, and will continue to support independent, peer-reviewed\nwork where appropriate and necessary,'' ideally under the aegis of\nthe US Food and Drug Administration.\n","Headline":"\nRESEARCHERS DECRY LEAK OF CELL PHONE DATA \n","Text":["\n   Scientists studying links between cellular telephone use and\ncancer are furious that preliminary data were leaked from their\nresearch in a way that, they say, falsely suggested that the phones\nmay be linked to brain tumors.\n","\n   In fact, investigators said Monday, the data show no clear link.\nSeveral people close to the situation said the consultant who\nreleased the information may have been trying to stir up fears to\nget millions of dollars more for himself or for associates to\ncontinue research.\n","\n   The consultant, a George Washington faculty member, George\nCarlo, denied that he is looking for more business.\n","\n   For years, studies have overwhelmingly disputed a cancer risk\nfrom the low-level electromagnetic energy of cell phones.
