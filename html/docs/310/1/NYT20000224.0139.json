The Marblehead Board of Health has banned smoking in\npublic places. This is the way a healthy democracy works. If enough\npeople object, they have redress through the voting booth.

Their\nconscious intent is to undermine the people's ability to act on\ntheir own behalf.\n\n   Representatives of the telecommunications industry recently\nappeared before the Board of Selectmen, bringing Marblehead face to\nface with what happens when corporations collide with grass-roots\ndemocracy.\n\n   According to B. Blake Levitt, author of ``Electromagnetic\nFields: A Consumer's Guide to the Issues and How to Protect\nOurselves,'' before 1996 protesters were able to cite numerous\nstudies as well as data collected from foreign military bases that\nindicated various health effects from nonionizing microwave\nradiation _ generated by cell phones _ among them increased\npermeability of the blood-brain barrier; damage to the immune\nsystem; numerous cancers; and DNA damage. Unlike the output of a\n100-watt light bulb, 100 watts of ultrahigh frequencies in the\nmicrowave band are maximally absorbed by human tissue, with the\nresult that long-term low-level exposure has been implicated in\nincreases in breast cancer, leukemia, cataracts, immune\nsuppression, and brain tumors. When citizens pointed out these\nfindings to town officials, they frequently responded by refusing\nto accept cell phone towers.\n\n   The Telecommunications Bill of 1996 removed this pesky obstacle\nto expanding cell phone use by taking away a community's right to\nrefuse to site antennae. Discussion of health or environmental\neffects has been prohibited at public hearings, since such\nconsiderations are irrelevant to tower siting. Although this raises\nissues of free speech, as well as public policy questions about\ngovernment's role in protecting the health of citizens, it takes\ntime and money to move these issues through the courts. Every year\nthat passes, more and more antennae go up.\n\n   After 1996, some elected officials continued to resist the lure\nof the lavish licensing fees cell phone companies were offering.\nSome towns set up moratoriums while they pondered the issues.\nOthers developed siting ordinances that confined towers to areas\nwith large setbacks (1,500 feet is optimal) from residences,\nschools, hospitals, and nursing homes. This put towns like\nMarblehead, with its troublesome 500-feet setback requirement,\ndirectly in the path of the grid of wireless communications planned\nto extend seamlessly across the United States.\n\n   How does a corporation get what it wants when the will of the\npeople opposes it? The National Rifle Association makes campaign\ncontributions to candidates willing to ignore the wishes of the\nmajority. W.R.
