A public health consultant with strong ties to industry,\nhe won the nation's most lucrative contract to oversee a series of\nstudies that scrutinized the relationship between cell-phone\nhandsets and cancer.\n\n   This $27 million, six-year research project was entirely\nbankrolled by wireless phone companies. Many were not surprised\nwhen the industry's trade group picked Carlo to head up the\nproject, which ultimately involved about 50 studies conducted at 16\nresearch labs.\n\n   But now that the project is winding down and its final report is\ndue out later this year, Carlo has created a stir by saying that\nconsumers should take some precautions when using cellular phones,\neven while scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration and\nelsewhere say that cell phones do not pose any danger to users.\n\n   Most of the studies showed cell phones to be safe, but a handful\nraised troubling questions, said Carlo, who heads the Wireless\nTechnology Research Group, which was established to oversee the\ncellular phone studies. He says that more research is needed before\ncell phones can be considered completely safe.\n\n   ``It's not an all-clear,'' said Carlo, 46, a lawyer who has a\nPh.D. in pathology. ``The science is in a gray area.''\n\n   In an interview two weeks ago, Carlo suggested that people\nshould keep the cell phone's antenna at least two inches away from\nthe head, and avoid letting children use the phones until more\nresearch is done.\n\n   While FDA officials and other scientists say Carlo has a sharp\nunderstanding of the current science on the subject, they don't\nshare his level of alarm.\n\n   Even Joshua Muscat, a New York epidemiologist whose brain-cancer\nstudies have been cited by Carlo as raising public health concerns,\nthinks Carlo's warnings are extreme.\n\n   ``At this point, I don't see scientific data that suggests there\nshould be a behavior change for people,'' he said.\n\n   The FDA's assessment is similar. ``We do not believe cell phones\ncan pose any health risks to humans,'' said Russell Owen, chief of\nthe radiation biology branch of the FDA's Center for Devices and\nRadiological Health.\n\n   When a person makes or receives a call on a wireless phone, low\nlevels of radio-frequency energy travel between a cell tower and\nthe antenna of a person's wireless phone. Owen is convinced that\nthe energy emitted isn't strong enough to cause any genetic damage,\neven with the antenna so close to the face.\n\n   He said scientists can prove safety hazards only when a certain\nlevel of radiation causes an object to warm up, or, in some other\nyet-unknown way, damages a body's cells.\n\n   Owen acknowledged that human cancer can be slow to develop, so\nit's possible researchers simply don't have enough data now to\nstudy the connection between cancer and cell phones. The explosion\nin cell-phone use is relatively recent _ there are an estimated 80\nmillion users now, more than double the number four years ago.\n\n   The National Cancer Institute is currently conducting its own\nstudy on whether cell phone use can be linked to brain cancer.\nResults are expected sometime next year.\n\n   Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications\nIndustry Association, which funded the project, said he's convinced\ncell phones are safe. Still, he refrained from any direct criticism\nof Carlo, saying simply that ``he was expected to be independent.''\n\n   Indeed, the six-year endeavor, while funded by Wheeler's group,\nwas designed to be independent; the money was placed in a blind\ntrust, and government auditors set up a system to monitor the\ndistribution of funds. And all studies initiated by Carlo and the\nWireless Technology Research Group were peer-reviewed by a panel at\nthe Harvard School of Public Health.\n\n   Even FDA officials, who were kept up-to-date on the research,\ninitially blessed the project.\n\n   In the project's first couple of years, it helped produce what\nhas been widely regarded as an impressive piece of research on\ncellular phone interference with cardiac pacemakers. That work led\nto changes in the manufacture of current-day pacemakers, Carlo\nsaid.\n\n   He has, however, come under much criticism for failing to\nproduce enough new research on cell phones and cancer risks given\nthe amount of money spent on the six-year project. He has also been\nfaulted for releasing preliminary results before the work and\nreviews were complete.\n\n   Susan Peck, the project manager for the Harvard peer-review\npanel, which oversaw the research, said some scientists questioned\nthe ``speed and amount of research'' that was conducted given his\nvast budget. But she believes much of it had to do with Carlo's\npainstaking planning process, in which he spent a great deal of\ntime selecting labs and experiments.\n\n   Peck said that based on her review of the data, she doesn't\nthink Carlo's warnings are out of line.\n\n   ``I don't own a cell phone,'' she said. ``But if I did and could\nkeep the antenna away from my head, I would.''\n\n   Louis Slesin, publisher of Microwave News, an industry watchdog\ngroup, said Carlo's call for more consumer protections is echoing\nsomething he's been saying for a long time. Slesin remains\nskeptical, however, about Carlo's ``death-bed conversion'' on\ncell-phone safety issues, and wonders if Carlo may just be wooing\nmore research money.\n\n   ``He's suddenly agreeing with what we've been saying for\nyears,'' Slesin said.\n\n   But Carlo said his views simply reflect his interpretation of\nthe current science. (He also emphasized that the greatest proven\ndanger of cell phones isn't cancer risk but car accidents.)\n\n   He defends his views about the possible biological hazards of\ncell phones by describing a handful of studies, including these:\n\n   _ Ray Tice, Graham Hook and colleagues at the Integrated\nLaboratory Systems at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina found\nwireless phone radiation causes genetic damage in human blood cells\nunder certain conditions.
