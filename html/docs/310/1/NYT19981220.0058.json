Times News Service    \n\n   The Federal Communications Commission is considering changing\nits regulations to permit the use of a radical and controversial\ncommunications technology that has the potential to make vastly\nmore efficient use of the increasingly precious radio spectrum.\n\n   Known variously as ultra-wide-band radio and digital pulse\nwireless, the new technology has a broad range of possible\napplications, from wireless voice and high-speed data\ncommunications to land mine detection and advanced radar systems\nthat could permit law officers to see through walls or could aid\ncars in avoiding collisions.\n\n   Despite its potential, however, the technology is not in\nwidespread commercial use today because it would run afoul of FCC\nrestrictions that prohibit radio transmissions in certain\nfrequencies set aside for civilian aviation and military agencies.\n\n   That could change if the agency agrees to proposals made earlier\nthis month by three small companies that are pursuing the\ntechnology for a variety of commercial products.\n\n   Unlike communications technologies that send information in\nanalog form, ultra-wide band uses a digital transmission consisting\nof small on-off bursts of energy at extremely low power but over\nalmost the entire radio spectrum.\n\n   By precisely timing the pulses within accuracies up to a\ntrillionth of a second, the designers of ultra-wide-band radio\nsystems are able to create low-power communications systems that\nare almost impossible to jam, tend to penetrate physical obstacles\neasily and are almost invulnerable to eavesdropping.\n\n   Time Domain Corp., based in Huntsville, Ala., has petitioned the\nFCC for a waiver so that by the middle of next year, it can begin\nselling a system that will permit police officers and special\nweapons and tactics teams to see through walls and doors to detect\nthe location of people. The company is also planning a covert\ncommunications system that will both carry voice communications and\ndisplay locations of a counter-terrorism or SWAT team's members.\n\n   ``We are focusing on the safety systems because it has a great\npublic benefit and it's a good way to introduce the technology\nwhere it can make a difference,'' said Ralph Petroff, the company's\nchairman and chief executive.\n\n   However, Time Domain executives as well as many experts familiar\nwith ultra-broad band believe the technology's real commercial\npotential lies in extremely low-cost communications applications.\nThat would entail a fundamental shift in FCC regulations, a process\nthat could take years.\n\n   ``When you take its attributes and compare it to the\ncompetition, you have very interesting technology that could lead\nto awesome possibilities,'' said Paul Turner, executive director of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Technology Center in Menlo Park,\nCalif.\n\n   The most promising application for ultra-wide-band radio might\neventually be an alternative to today's wireless office network\ntechnologies that are generally able to transmit data at rates of\nbetween 1 and 3 million bits a second.\n\n   Because of its design, ultra-wide band advocates say the\ntechnology has the potential to deliver vastly higher amounts of\ndata because a large number of transmitters could broadcast\nsimultaneously in close proximity without interfering with each\nother.\n\n   ``The most promising applications are not so much as an\nalternative to cellular telephone,'' said Lawrence Larson, an\nelectrical engineer at the University of California at San Diego.\n``It may rather provide a much better way of doing short-range data\ncommunications because it's very energy efficient.''\n\n   The computer and communications industries have already settled\non a standard known as Bluetooth for wireless connectivity in an\nunlicensed frequency band at 2.4 gigahertz. Bluetooth, which can\nsend a million bits a second about 30 feet using 100 milliwatts\n(about a tenth of a watt), is intended to interconnect devices like\npalm computers, laptops and cellular phones.\n\n   In contrast, Time Domain's devices can currently transmit 1.25\nmillion bits a second up to 230 feet using just .5 milliwatts, or\none-thousandth the power used by Bluetooth. These transmissions are\nbeing achieved with the first working prototype chips the company\nhas received from IBM, which fabricated them using the advanced\nsilicon germanium semiconductor material developed for\ncommunications applications.\n\n   Standard wireless transmissions encode data in a continuous sine\nwave by varying the amplitude (the size of the wave) or the\nfrequency (the number of times the wave cycles each second),\nsometimes both. In contrast, Time Domain's technology is similar to\na Morse code system that, at this point in its development,\nswitches on and off 40 million times a second. And unlike\ntraditional radio signals, which are confined to a very narrow\nfrequency, each pulse of ultra-wide band is transmitted across a\nwide portion of the radio spectrum, so that only a tiny amount of\nenergy is radiated at any single frequency.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The company said it believes that the bandwidth, or\ndata-carrying capacity, of its technology can be expanded to many\ntimes its current limit _ perhaps as high as billions of bits per\nsecond.\n\n   Moreover, while standard narrowband wireless technologies have a\nlimited bandwidth, the digital pulse approach has the potential to\nhandle a large number of simultaneous users in close proximity,\nTime Domain officials said.\n\n   Ultra-wide band has the added advantage of being significantly\nmore resistant to ``multipath interference,'' a problem that\nplagues indoor radio systems because signals tend to bounce off\nmany surfaces.\n\n   Industry officials said they did not expect an early resolution\nto the FCC's inquiry, which was begun in August. One particular\nobstacle is that a key official at the Federal Aviation\nAdministration has filed an objection with the FCC, warning about a\npotential problem caused by the clustering of large numbers of\ntransmitters, even at very low power levels.\n\n   However, industry officials note that current FCC rules permit\n``incidental'' emitters _ generally, consumer devices like personal\ncomputers, hair dryers, electric razors, automobiles and arc\nwelders _ and that no hazard has been demonstrated from the many\nmillions of these products in everyday use.\n\n   Last month, a group of scientists and engineers met at Interval\nResearch Corp., a computer industry research center financed by\nPaul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., to coordinate industry\ninput into the FCC decision-making process.\n\n   More recently, an Interval physicist, Roberto Aiello, filed an\nindependent comment with the agency, reporting that a simulation by\nhis research group indicated that even if millions of\nultra-wide-band transmitters were allowed to operate, they would\nhave a negligible impact on aviation and other communications\nsystems.\n\n   ``The FAA is worried about this, and I think it's a good\nposition for them to take,'' Aiello said. ``But I think there's\nconcrete evidence that there will not be interference from\nultra-wide band.''\n\n   In addition to Time Domain, companies asking the FCC for\nexemptions from spectrum regulations include Radar Inc., which is\ndeveloping a system for finding buried objects and looking behind\nwalls, and Zircon Corp., a maker of high technology tools like\ndevices that find joists in walls.\n","Headline":"\nFCC RULES CHANGE WOULD ALLOW USE OF ULTRA-WIDE-BAND RADIO \n","Text":["\n   The Federal Communications Commission is considering changing\nits regulations to permit the use of a radical and controversial\ncommunications technology that has the potential to make vastly\nmore efficient use of the increasingly precious radio spectrum.\n","\n   Known variously as ultra-wide-band radio and digital pulse\nwireless, the new technology has a broad range of possible\napplications, from wireless voice and high-speed data\ncommunications to land mine detection and advanced radar systems\nthat could permit law officers to see through walls or could aid\ncars in avoiding collisions.\n","\n   Despite its potential, however, the technology is not in\nwidespread commercial use today because it would run afoul of FCC\nrestrictions that prohibit radio transmissions in certain\nfrequencies set aside for civilian aviation and military agencies.\n","\n   That could change if the agency agrees to proposals made earlier\nthis month by three small companies that are pursuing the\ntechnology for a variety of commercial products.\n","\n   Unlike communications technologies that send information in\nanalog form, ultra-wide band uses a digital transmission consisting\nof small on-off bursts of energy at extremely low power but over\nalmost the entire radio spectrum.\n","\n   By precisely timing the pulses within accuracies up to a\ntrillionth of a second, the designers of ultra-wide-band radio\nsystems are able to create low-power communications systems that\nare almost impossible to jam, tend to penetrate physical obstacles\neasily and are almost invulnerable to eavesdropping.\n","\n   Time Domain Corp., based in Huntsville, Ala., has petitioned the\nFCC for a waiver so that by the middle of next year, it can begin\nselling a system that will permit police officers and special\nweapons and tactics teams to see through walls and doors to detect\nthe location of people.
