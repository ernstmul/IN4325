But\nscientists at the US Food and Drug Administration and elsewhere say\nthere is no evidence to support Carlo's recommendations. He\nrecently sat down with a reporter to explain his views on the\nsafest ways to use cell phones based on his reading of the evidence\nto date.\n\n    \n\n   Q. You believe today's cell-phones pose some danger to users?\n\n   A. The science is in a gray area. We have scientific information\nnow that suggests genetic damage and some increased risk of cancer.\nMy current recommendation at this point has to do with moving the\nantenna away from your head.\n\n    \n\n   Q. Why is that, and how far away do you think it should be?\n\n   A. You want the antenna at least two inches away from your head.\nWe've found the penetration of radiation into the brain doesn't go\nmuch more than 2 or 2.5 inches. If you have an antenna right next\nto your head, you are going to have exposure.\n\n    \n\n   Q. You use a headset when talking on\n\n   the phone. (The accessory has a small earpiece attached by wire\nto a tiny microphone that can be clipped onto clothing.) Isn't that\nextreme?\n\n   A. It doesn't seem extreme at all. Everyone has to make their\nown judgments.\n\n    \n\n   Q. My cell phone has a pull-up antenna. Does that mean I should\nkeep it in a pulled-up position when I talk?\n\n   A. Yes, that's better than leaving it inside the phone and\ncloser to your face.\n\n    \n\n   Q. What about children and teenagers using cell phones?\n\n   A. There are no cell-phone studies directly related to kids. But\nbased on what we've learned in the past six years, my\nrecommendation is that it's much better for children to use a pager\nthan a cell phone.\n\n   I have three children, ages 19, 18 and 17. They all have pagers.\nI've been living with this research for six years, and that's the\njudgment I've made.\n\n    \n\n   Q. What about duration? Is it better to keep talking time to a\nminimum?\n\n   A. At this point, I can't tell you whether or not a five-minute\nphone call is better or worse than five one-minute phone calls. We\ndo know that more power is required to connect a phone call, so the\ninitial seconds when you call someone or accept a phone call\nexposes you to the most radiation.\n\n    \n\n   Q. So particularly, while dialing and waiting for someone to\nanswer, I should keep the phone's antenna away from me?\n\n   A. Yes, that would reduce the radiation you get. Also, the\namount of power depends on your distance from the tower or base\nstation. The closer you are to a tower, the less power is needed to\nconnect the call.\n\n    \n\n   Q. Let's get to a final _ and not so controversial _ consumer\nsafeguard. What about driving while talking on a cell phone?\n\n   A. You don't need science to tell you talking on the phone while\ndriving isn't a smart thing. I actually got into a car accident two\nweeks ago while talking. And I was wearing a headset. Nobody was\nhurt, but I rear-ended a truck in front of me. I felt terrible. All\nI could think was, of all people, I should know better.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   Carlo said he's just ``letting the chips fall as they may,''\neven if it angers industry funders.\n","\n   Wheeler of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,\nwho said he has no hard feelings about Carlo, noted that the\nindustry's future funding efforts will be directed to the FDA or\nother government-sponsored bodies.\n","\n   Peck, who headed the Harvard peer-review panel, said Carlo's\nviews are based on his best judgment after having lived with this\nissue for six years.\n","\n   ``He's not afraid to argue with anybody,'' she said. ``He sticks\nup for what he believes.''\n","\n     \n-------   \n  \n","\n   George Carlo, who headed a $27 million research project on\ncellular phones to be released later this year, believes consumers\nshould take certain precautions when using wireless phones.
