HOWE  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   The next time you see someone walking down the street, talking\nanimatedly to no one, check to see if she has a wire dangling out\nof her ear before you decide she's nuts and avoid eye contact. It\ncould be she's caught on to what seems to be the hottest fad in\nwireless telephone gadgets: the cellphone headset.\n\n   Such devices _ already a full-scale trend in the trendiest parts\nof Los Angeles and Miami _ allow you to talk on your wireless phone\nwithout using your hands. They are becoming hot sellers among local\nwireless providers. You keep the phone in your pocket.\n\n   ``It has to be the most common thing we're seeing with new\nsubscribers,'' said Karin Olson, spokeswoman for the New England\noperations of Omnipoint Communications.\n\n   ``In the last two months, probably 20 to 25 percent of new\nsubscribers'' asked for them,Olson said.\n\n   David Thomson of Bell Atlantic Mobile agreed: ``The biggest\ntrend we're seeing is headsets, both to promote safety and to\nimprove the convenience and clarity of conversation.''\n\n   Like most of its rivals, Bell Atlantic Mobile offers headsets\nfor every phone it sells, ranging in price from about $15 to $30. A\nheadset plugs into an outlet on the telephone, so the subscriber\nhas two hands free to drive or work on the computer.\n\n   There are, of course, a few different models:\n\n   --``Ear buds'' have a little plug that fits inside the ear and a\nminiature microphone that dangles from a wire.\n\n   --Headsets with ``boom'' microphones, like\n\n   you would see an airline reservation agent wearing.\n\n   --``Ear caps'' slip over the top of your ear, which some people\nfind less annoying than having a little plug in their ear canal.\n\n   This month, Bell Atlantic plans to roll out improved headsets\nwith volume controls and ``noise cancellation'' technology to focus\nthe sound of your voice _ not the kids' screams from the back seat\n_ into the phone.\n\n   Within two years, once problems with recharging batteries are\nworked out, Bell Atlantic hopes to roll out the ultimate: a\nwireless wireless headset, with no cord connecting the headset to\nthe phone.\n\n   At least one motivation for the products seems to be largely\nunproven but hard-to-extinguish concerns that using cellphones can\ncause brain cancer or other illnesses. Even though current digital\nphones use far less power and emit much less electromagnetic\nradiation than the first-generation wireless phones of the 1980s,\nmany people prefer to keep their phones what feels like a safe\ndistance from their brains.\n\n   A company called EarHugger in Lindon, Utah, on the Web at\nEarhugger.com, sells a $15 improved wireless phone headset that has\nno microphone. It picks up the sound of your voice through\nvibrations transmitted through your jaw and works on Ericsson,\nNokia, and other units.\n\n   Other popular new wireless gizmos include:\n\n   _ A $90 desktop device that turns your wireless phone into a\nspeakerphone. Bell Atlantic plans to begin selling it locally later\nthis month, initially for the Motorola StarTac line of phones.\n\n   Nextel Communications, whose phones with built-in two-way radio\ncapabilities make them popular with tradespeople, delivery fleets,\nand public safety officials _ but a little pricey for average\nconsumers _ sells a range of Motorola phones that have a speaker\nphone built in.\n\n   _ If you still don't believe that wireless phones are not going\nto turn your brain to microwaved mush, Consider spending $59 for a\nMicroshield sheath made of PVC plastic, wire mesh, and leather.\nIt's available at wavelengthonline.com. and includes a part that\ncovers the antenna, the source of most radiation emitted by the\nphone while allowing you to see the screen clearly.\n\n   Peter Howe covers New England telecommunications for the Globe's\nbusiness section.\n","Headline":"\nCELLPHONES, HEADSETS _ WHAT ELSE IS NEW IN WIRELESS? \n","Text":["\n   The next time you see someone walking down the street, talking\nanimatedly to no one, check to see if she has a wire dangling out\nof her ear before you decide she's nuts and avoid eye contact.
