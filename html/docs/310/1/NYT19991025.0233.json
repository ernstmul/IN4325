Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica\nbecause of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which\ncontains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the\nsea. If just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _\nshould do this, global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17\nfeet, inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic\nconsequences for humanity. By Malcolm W. Browne.\n\n   With graphic.\n\n   SCI-BRAZIL-SKULL (Rio de Janeiro) _ A human skull at the\nNational Museum of Brazil here has been attracting crowds and\ncontroversy in equal measure since it was unveiled this month.\nAfter two decades in storage, the skull has now been identified as\nthe oldest human remains ever recovered in the Western Hemisphere.\nThe skull is that of a young woman believed to have roamed the\nsavannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago. A\nreconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are\nnegroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may\nhave initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by a\npeople distinct from the ancestors of today's Amerindians. By Larry\nRohter. (1400 words)\n\n   With map.\n\n   SCI-BRAIN (Undated) _ A highly respected neuroscientist has\ndeveloped a provocative new theory of how the brain is organized\nwhich, if confirmed, would explain how and why the mind produces\nsymptoms found in several seemingly unrelated disorders. According\nto the theory, the deep sadness in severe depression, the hand\nwringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears\nof tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the\nshaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the\nsame basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that\nnormally fire their cells in synchrony.

And with a new\ngeneration of gamma ray observatories coming into operation now,\nastronomers say that the party is just beginning. By James Glanz.\n(1360 words)\n\n   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ A new calculation suggests that\ndense star clusters, which are sprinkled throughout galaxies in\nEarth's cosmic neighborhood, act as assembly lines for tightly\norbiting pairs of black holes and then spit them out of the\ncluster. There, they eventually fall together and merge into one.\nNext year, if all goes well, scientists will be able to take the\nfirst steps toward testing that theory with a new $350 million\ninstrument called a gravity wave observatory.

Hospitals may not be\ncalled pest houses anymore, but they are still terrible places to\nbe sick. They are all crawling with bacteria, with strangers who\nare sometimes kindly but sometimes not, with the potential for bad\naccidents; hospitals assault the senses from every direction, and\nthen they send a bill.
