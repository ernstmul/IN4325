Private individuals and cell phone companies have supplied\nseed money, Carlo said. He estimated it could take a year or more\nto raise the $60 million he says is needed to conduct the studies.\n\n   Carlo declined to name the backers but stressed that his\norganization is not accepting money from plaintiffs lawyers, who\ncould profit if a conclusive link is demonstrated between cell\nphones and disease.\n\n   Carlo previously headed a five-year, $27 million project funded\nby the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the\nindustry's trade association, that found possible health problems\nassociated with cellular phones use.\n\n   Carlo said the new studies _ expected to last four years _ would\nbe farmed out to research and academic institutions around the\ncountry.\n\n   The surveillance aspect of the research is unique among studies\nthat assess cell phone health risks, according to Carlo.\n\n   ``Right now, nobody in the world is looking for specific health\nproblems'' possibly associated with specific brands of cell phones,\nCarlo said. For the surveillance study, the idea is to get as many\ncell phone users as possible to fill out detailed questionnaires\nand allow themselves to be monitored by researchers on a regular\nbasis.\n\n   Scientists will watch for ``clusters'' of disease _ large\nnumbers of people suffering from a particular ailment who may also\nshare the same type of cell phone. ``If we have a cluster, we'll\nsend out a team into the field to do in-depth interviews. That may\nlead us to making some type of conclusion in terms of a risk or may\nlead to a follow-up research study,'' Carlo said.\n\n   Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the CTIA, said he was not\nfamiliar with the planned studies. But he stressed that the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration and international health organizations\n``thus far concluded that wireless phone use has no impact on\npublic health.''\n\n   The FDA says there is no scientific basis for concluding that\ncell phones are unsafe _ or safe. The only way to conclusively\nanswer the safety question is through ``a significant research\neffort,'' the FDA says.\n\n   That effort is scheduled to get underway later this year when\nthe FDA and CTIA are expected to announce a joint research effort\nto determine if there are cell phone health risks.
