HOWE  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   With more than 70 million Americans now regularly using cell\nphones, concerns are mounting about the public danger of distracted\nmotorists talking on their phones while they drive.\n\n   But while some communities are banning the practice, a new\nHarvard University study cautions that the risks of using a cell\nphone while driving have not been clearly shown _ and that the\nbenefits for public safety and personal productivity should be\nconsidered, too.\n\n   While some people using phones may drive erratically and in rare\ncases crash into other cars or pedestrians, cell phones also are a\nboon for reporting accidents and drunken drivers and for making\nbetter use of one's time, the study authors said.\n\n   From a cost-benefit standpoint, researchers at the Harvard\nCenter for Risk Analysis say, banning the use of cell phones would\nbe far less productive than lowering the speed limit to 55 miles\nper hour or requiring more effective air bags and seat belts in\ncars.\n\n   ``The risks of using a cell phone while driving are real, but\nthey're smaller than many other risks you face in everyday life,\nand the benefits are very real and may be larger than have been\npreviously realized,'' said Karen Lissy, the study's lead author\nand director of the center's Program on Motor Vehicles and Public\nHealth.\n\n   The study was funded under a $300,000 grant from AT&T Wireless,\none of the nation's biggest cell phone providers. But it was\nreviewed for objectivity by 12 specialists, including some leading\nopponents of cell phone usage while driving, the study's authors\nsaid.\n\n   Last week, the National Highway Transportation Safety\nAdministration urged that drivers avoid talking on cell phones _ or\nusing other new electronic devices like on-board computers _ while\nbehind the wheel.\n\n   ``Driver distraction in all its forms is a real threat to the\nsafety of American roads,'' agency deputy chief Rosalyn Millman\nsaid at a Washington hearing.\n\n   Beyond today's epidemic of motorists using one hand to drive\nwhile talking on wireless phones, Millman said, ``The plethora of\ngadgets and gizmos that are being designed into vehicles may be the\nmuch bigger threat of tomorrow. Will we learn about those risks and\ndeal with them expeditiously? Or will we wait for rising numbers of\ndeaths and injuries?''\n\n   A handful of US communities, including Brooklyn, Ohio, Marlboro\nTownship, N.J., and three Pennsylvania towns, have enacted local\nordinances banning the use of hand-held phones while driving. At\nleast 19 states are considering laws banning the practice. France,\nJapan and Sweden have laws regulating cell phone use while driving.\n\n   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, compile data on cell\nphones as a contributing factor to accidents. Using multiple\nsources, the Harvard study estimates the risk of an American dying\nwhile driving and using a cell phone is about 6.4 in 1 million per\nyear. That compares to a 30 in 1 million chance per year of a\ndriver dying from driving drunk for a half-hour every month.\n\n   Put another way, the risk that a motorist will be killed by a\ndriver using a cell phone is 1.5 in 1 million annually, about\n1/12th the risk of being killed in a crash with a large truck or\nwith a sober driver not using a cell phone.\n\n   But a 1997 New England Journal of Medicine study of 699 drivers\nin accidents found that using a phone increased by fourfold the\nrisk of having a crash.\n\n   The Harvard report also calculates the benefits to society of\nbanning cell phone usage while driving according to a standard\npublic health formula called cost per quality-adjusted life-year\nsaved. It attributes a higher value to a healthy year of life\ncompared to a year spent sick or maimed.\n\n   Taking an American Enterprise Institute-Brookings Institution\nestimate that the economic benefits of using a cell phone while\ndriving amount to $25 billion annually in the United States, the\nstudy projects it would cost $700,000 per quality-adjusted year of\nlife saved from a ban on cell phone use while driving.\n\n   That cost is anywhere from 9 to 30 times as expensive as\nimposing a 55 miles per hour national speed limit, or requiring\nadded air bags, seat belts and side-door beams in vehicles.\n\n   Wireless industry officials contend the answer is better public\neducation and advertising including an industry campaign urging\npeople to ``make safety your most important call.''\n\n   Thomas Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications\nIndustry Association, said Americans made 118,000 emergency calls\nto hospitals and police last year, suggesting a large benefit from\nsummoning quicker help for accident victims.\n","Headline":"\nHARVARD STUDY DOWNPLAYS RISK OF CELL PHONE USE BY DRIVERS \n","Text":["\n   With more than 70 million Americans now regularly using cell\nphones, concerns are mounting about the public danger of distracted\nmotorists talking on their phones while they drive.\n","\n   But while some communities are banning the practice, a new\nHarvard University study cautions that the risks of using a cell\nphone while driving have not been clearly shown _ and that the\nbenefits for public safety and personal productivity should be\nconsidered, too.\n","\n   While some people using phones may drive erratically and in rare\ncases crash into other cars or pedestrians, cell phones also are a\nboon for reporting accidents and drunken drivers and for making\nbetter use of one's time, the study authors said.\n","\n   From a cost-benefit standpoint, researchers at the Harvard\nCenter for Risk Analysis say, banning the use of cell phones would\nbe far less productive than lowering the speed limit to 55 miles\nper hour or requiring more effective air bags and seat belts in\ncars.\n","\n   ``The risks of using a cell phone while driving are real, but\nthey're smaller than many other risks you face in everyday life,\nand the benefits are very real and may be larger than have been\npreviously realized,'' said Karen Lissy, the study's lead author\nand director of the center's Program on Motor Vehicles and Public\nHealth.\n","\n   The study was funded under a $300,000 grant from AT&T Wireless,\none of the nation's biggest cell phone providers.
