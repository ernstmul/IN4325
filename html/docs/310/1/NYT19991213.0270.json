Times News Service   \n\n   In America, zinc supplements have mainly been discussed in\nrecent years as a potential cure for the common cold.\n\n   But in developing nations, according to an article published in\nthe December issue of The Journal of Pediatrics, zinc supplements\ncould offer the most cost-effective way of reducing the two leading\ncauses of childhood death: pneumonia and diarrhea.\n\n   Zinc deficiency is common among the world's poor. Exactly what\nrole the mineral plays in the body is not clear, but a lack of it\nappears to hamper the body's immune system.\n\n   Part of the appeal of zinc is that it can be added to diets\nrelatively inexpensively, for example, by adding it to bread or\nother foods. The extra zinc, researcher said, reduced diarrhea,\nrespiratory illnesses and skin disorders by 56 percent among\nTurkish schoolchildren.\n\n   For a broader look at the effect of zinc supplements, members of\nthe Child Health Research Project _ a collaborative effort by the\nWorld Health Organization, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard _\nanalyzed data from 10 controlled trials in countries around the\nworld.\n\n   They found that zinc reduced the number of cases of childhood\ndiarrhea by 25 percent; by comparison, the WHO has estimated that\nhigh-quality improvements in water and sanitation would reduce the\nincidence by 27 percent, but at a far greater cost.\n\n   The effect on pneumonia was even more striking, reducing cases\nby 41 percent, the study said.\n\n   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Michael Hambidge and Dr. Nancy\nKrebs of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in\nDenver noted that zinc deficiencies might be corrected either by\nfortifying food during manufacturing or by using plant breeding\ntechniques to increase the mineral content of grains and legumes.\n\n   ``The enormous appeal of correcting zinc deficiency is that in\nnormalizing the function of cells in multiple tissues, it enhances\nthe child's ability to combat disease states and not just single\ninfectious organisms,'' they wrote.\n\n   ``Thus,'' they added, ``on a worldwide public health level, it\nis likely to be more economically feasible than vaccines directed\nagainst specific organisms.''\n     \n\n   PATTERNS: Of Rats, Mazes and Cellular Phones\n\n   The question of cell phones and their radiation lingers on. In\n1993, an expert panel was to settle the issue, but then left a big\nquestion mark.\n\n   The panel rejected heavily publicized claims that cell phones\npromoted brain tumors.\n\n   Nevertheless, it suggested that much remained to be learned\nabout the effects of radiation emitted by phones on the human\nbrain.\n\n   Now, a rat study has raised the possibility that the radiation\nmight adversely affect learning and memory.\n\n   In the study, to be published in the January issue of the\njournal Bioengineering, Dr. Henry Lai, a bioengineering professor\nat the University of Washington in Seattle, looked at the effects\nof microwave radiation on long-term memory formation.\n\n   Lai trained two groups of rats to swim through a tank of water\nto a submerged platform. Since the water had been made murky, they\nhad to first learn, then memorize the location of the platform.\n\n   Rats that were exposed for an hour to pulsed microwaves similar\nto the radiation emitted by cell phones were ``much slower in\nfinding the platform during the training sessions,'' Lai said.\n\n   Then the platform was removed, and the rats were sent back for\nanother swim. The rats that were not exposed to the radiation\ngenerally swam around where the platform had been, as if\n``scratching their heads, saying `We thought it was here,''' Lai\nsaid.\n\n   The rats exposed to radiation swam around more randomly, Lai\nsaid, suggesting that the maps they had made in their heads was not\nas clear.\n\n   CAUSE AND EFFECT: The Many Faces of Holiday Depression\n\n   The thoughts of editors of medical journals apparently turn to\ndepression around this time of year, when more people are known to\nget depressed. A survey of recent research articles and conference\nreports found several, including these:\n\n   _ Among people over 70, depression increases the risk of\ndeveloping a wide range of diseases as much as smoking does, a\nUniversity of Michigan study of 6,000 older Americans found. The\nresults were presented at the annual meeting of the Gerontological\nSociety of America. Earlier studies had linked depression to higher\nrates of cancer and cognitive decline; this research found that\ndepression lifted overall rates of ``disease burden'' as much as\nsmoking and more than obesity, though not as much as lack of\nphysical strength.\n\n   _ Speaking of smoking, a Johns Hopkins University study\npublished in The American Journal of Public Health found that\nteenagers who smoked were at greater risk for depression. But, the\nstudy found, depression did not appear to prompt young people to\nsmoke.\n\n   _ For people with Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, depression is a\nbetter predictor of coronary heart disease than high blood sugar,\naccording to a University of Pittsburgh study to be published in\nthe January issue of the journal Atherosclerosis.\n\n   Another study found this: Teen-age girls care an awful lot about\nwhat other people think of them; teen-age boys, not so much. That\nhigher rate of what University of New Hampshire researchers call\nemotional reliance was found to be associated with higher rates of\ndepression for young women in a survey of 1,393 people in Toronto.\nThe results were published last week in The Journal of Health and\nSocial Behavior.\n\n   In 1872, Charles Darwin wrote, ``Infants, when suffering even\nslight pain or discomfort, utter violent and prolonged screams.''\nThe observation, reported recently in the British Medical Journal,\ncame in connection with a study looking at what clinical trials\ncould reliably establish about the best ways to calm them down.\n\n   Interest has been fueled by the growing number of premature\nbabies kept alive by intensive _ and often painful treatment in\nneonatal units, and by the recent recognition that even very\npremature infants can feel pain.\n\n   The study by pediatricians at Poissy Hospital in France examined\nthe analgesic powers of sweet solutions (sucrose and glucose) and\npacifiers compared with placebos.\n\n   The solutions and pacifiers were found effective, according to\npain ratings made on the basis of facial expression, limb movements\nand crying. But the most effective measure was a pacifier alone.\n\n   Exactly why pacifiers work is a mystery. But the researchers\nspeculated that the sensory input from sucking may override or\ndistract from pain signals, or that infants may be comforted by the\nfact that the pacifier gives them some control over what they are\nexperiencing.\n\n   OUTCOMES: When Time Heals a Damaged Heart\n\n   In 1997, the popular diet drug combination known as fen-phen was\npulled off the market after Mayo Clinic researchers found an\nincrease in heart valve disease among people taking the\nmedications. In a follow-up study published last week, researchers\nfrom the clinic concluded that the valve damage appeared to improve\nafter patients stopped taking the pills.\n\n   The new study looked at 30 men and women who had been taking\neither fen-phen (fenfluramine and phentermine) or a placebo for an\naverage of 41 weeks as part of an unrelated study of the diet\ndrugs. Their hearts were examined by echocardiogram shortly after\nthey stopped taking the medicines and about six months later.\n\n   Eight of the patients taking fen-phen were found to have some\nsign of heart valve disease, said Dr. Donald Hensrud, a Mayo Clinic\nnutrition specialist who led the new study, which was published in\nthe Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

In fact, all of the patients whose\nvalves were affected showed improvement in the six-month follow up.\n\n   ``These new findings should be reassuring for those Americans\nwho took fen-phen,'' he said.

But he\nsaid the findings were consistent with patients' reports that they\nhad fewer symptoms associated with valve disease after the drugs\nwere withdrawn.\n\n   Even so, he urged those who took either drug to consult their\ndoctors.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nTREATMENTS: ZINC SUPPLEMENTS, FOR THE LIFE OF A CHILD \nPATTERNS: OF RATS, MAZES AND CELLULAR PHONES \nCAUSE AND EFFECT: THE MANY FACES OF HOLIDAY DEPRESSION \nOUTCOMES: WHEN TIME HEALS A DAMAGED HEART\n","Text":["\n   In America, zinc supplements have mainly been discussed in\nrecent years as a potential cure for the common cold.\n","\n   But in developing nations, according to an article published in\nthe December issue of The Journal of Pediatrics, zinc supplements\ncould offer the most cost-effective way of reducing the two leading\ncauses of childhood death: pneumonia and diarrhea.\n","\n   Zinc deficiency is common among the world's poor.
