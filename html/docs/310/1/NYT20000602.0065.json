BRODY    \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Mighty Cyberengines Spew Health Myths\n\n   When my sons were in the first grade, a rumor circulated through\nNew York City elementary schools that cockroaches often\ncontaminated canned tuna. Though the boys liked other fish,\nincluding sardines, they refused to eat canned tuna in any form and\nstill avoid it more than 20 years later.\n\n   Like alligators living in the sewer, many urban myths assume a\nlife of their own despite a total lack of supporting evidence. The\nalligator myth is more a source of amusement than a problem for\nanyone, since very few of us venture into sewers. But when myths\ninvolve health issues, they can result in needless anxiety,\navoidance behavior and inconvenience.\n\n   In years past, these unsubstantiated rumors about health hazards\nlurking in our midst spread relatively slowly from person to person\nby word of mouth, unless some radio or television program happened\nto give them national airing. Now there is a new rapid-fire means\nof transmitting misinformation nationwide, even worldwide, via\ne-mail and the Internet. And since these communications appear in\nwriting, rumors about health hazards floating around cyberspace\nseem to acquire an undeserved validity that makes them more likely\nto be believed than any oral warning.\n\n   Of course, not everyone is equally gullible. Still, some people\nreact with fear, even panic, when a cybermyth about health appears\non their computer screens. Several of these ``urban health myths''\nare exposed for what little they are worth in the May issue of Mayo\nClinic Women's HealthSource, a newsletter published by the Mayo\nClinic in Rochester, Minn. I have added one of my own, on aluminum,\nthat predates cyberspace but refuses to die.\n\n   MYTH: Cooking in aluminum pots causes Alzheimer's disease. The\nsick brain cells of people with Alzheimer's disease have been found\nto contain high amounts of aluminum. This prompted people to point\na guilty finger at aluminum pots and pans as a source of this\nelement that they believe damage brain cells, resulting in\nsenility. Countless people tossed out all their aluminum cookware,\nreplacing it with stainless steel and enameled cast iron.\n\n   But what those who panicked failed to realize is that sick cells\ntend to accumulate toxic metals because they are unable to\neliminate them. Despite numerous investigations, there is no\nscientifically reliable evidence that aluminum is the cause, rather\nthan the result, of a diseased brain.\n\n   MYTH: Antiperspirants cause breast cancer. A persistent Internet\nmyth is that since antiperspirants block sweat glands, those in the\nunderarm are unable to eliminate toxic substances, sending them\ninstead into nearby lymph nodes, where they cause genetic mutations\nthat result in cancer.\n\n   First, sweat glands do not eliminate toxins and are not\nconnected to the lymph system. Rather, toxins are processed through\nthe liver and kidneys. Second, breast cancer does not arise in\nlymph nodes. It may spread to underarm nodes, but it starts within\nthe breast tissue, usually in milk ducts. Third, there is no\nevidence linking breast cancer to not sweating. Fourth, no\ningredient in antiperspirants is known to cause cancer. Finally,\namong countless studies of risk factors associated with breast\ncancer, not one has pointed to antiperspirants as a remotely\npossible cause.\n\n   MYTH: Costa Rican bananas carry flesh-eating bacteria. Whenever\na frightening, mysterious illness gains widespread attention, myths\ntend to abound as to its source. Hence the myth that touching the\nskin of bananas grown in Costa Rica can expose a person to the\nbacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis, a potentially deadly\ndisease caused by bacteria that attack the flesh in science-fiction\nfashion.\n\n   Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by various bacteria, including\nGroup A streptococcus that is found on people's skin and in their\nthroats. It is transmitted from through saliva or mucus or through\nsores on the skin to another person who broken skin. The bacteria\ncannot infect intact skin. Nor are they carried on bananas.\n\n   MYTH: Aspartame causes ... you-name-it. According to the Mayo\nClinic, one woman is the source of the belief that the artificial\nsweetener aspartame causes everything from obesity to manic\ndepression to multiple sclerosis. The woman maintains that the Food\nand Drug Administration, in cahoots with commercial interests, has\nsuppressed evidence of aspartame's risks and that all the studies\nindicating its safety are tainted because they have been financed\nby the company that produces it.\n\n   One study published in 1997 linked aspartame to a rise in brain\ntumors. But the increase in these tumors, which began in the 1970s,\npredates the introduction of aspartame into the food supply. There\nare many factors that might account for the rise in brain tumors,\nbut none, including the use of cellular phones, has been\nestablished with any degree of scientific certainty.\n\n   When aspartame was first introduced, there was a suspected link\nto seizures and depression that also has not been substantiated by\nfurther research. And the claimed link to multiple sclerosis has\nbeen disputed by the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.\n\n   In an indirect way, however, aspartame and every other sugar\nsubstitute might be partly to blame for the rise in obesity. While\nthe sweeteners themselves contribute few or no calories to the\ndiet, they do help to perpetuate the desire for very sweet foods.\nSince 1975, the per capita consumption of sugar and other caloric\nsweeteners has sharply increased, by more than 28 pounds a year.\nThat certainly is no help to America's expanding waistline.\n\n   There are any number of other urban health tales now circulating\non the Internet that have been refuted by reliable sources with no\nax to grind, including the government agency most directly\nconcerned with the public's health, the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention. Among the prevailing myths are that kidneys and\nother organs are being stolen from live victims without their\nknowledge (the National Kidney Foundation says no way!) and that a\ndeadly spider dubbed Arachnius gluteus lives under the seats of\npublic toilets awaiting a sumptuous derriere to bite. A report\nattributing the deaths of three women to such a bite was supposedly\npublished in The Journal of the United Medical Association.\nHowever, as noted by the Mayo newsletter, there is no such spider\nand there is no such journal.\n\n   The moral of this story is don't be so quick to believe\neverything you read on the Net or hear on a broadcast. Check the\nsource and evidence before you panic.\n\n   Â \n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: MIGHTY CYBERENGINES SPEW HEALTH MYTHS \n","Text":["\n   Mighty Cyberengines Spew Health Myths\n","\n   When my sons were in the first grade, a rumor circulated through\nNew York City elementary schools that cockroaches often\ncontaminated canned tuna.
