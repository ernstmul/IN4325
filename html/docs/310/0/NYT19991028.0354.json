Soon afterward, the agency accused him of plotting to\nkill Reno and of hosting a meeting with the New York World Trade\nCenter bombers a week before the 1993 attack. But he was never\ncharged with any crime.\n\n   During his immigration hearings, Kiareldeen, a native of Gaza,\nused rent receipts, phone records and other testimony to show that\nhe did not live at the address of the alleged meeting and that he\nwas not planning to kill Reno.\n\n   Last week in Newark, N.J., U.S. District Judge William Walls\nruled that detaining an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence\nwas unconstitutional, and Kiareldeen was ordered freed.

David E. Bonior, D-Mich., speaking at a news\nconference here, called on Congress to pass the Secret Evidence\nRepeal Act of 1999, which would ban the secret evidence in\nimmigration cases.\n\n   Bonior said Congress mistakenly gave the INS authority to use\nsecret evidence when it passed the 1996 Anti-terrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act in the wake of the April 19, 1995,\nbombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City that\nkilled 168 people.\n\n   He said the only effective solution to cases like Kiareldeen's\nwould be to eradicate the practice of using secret evidence.\n\n   ``Hany Kiareldeen's release will be a hollow victory unless we\npermanently discard this law,'' said Bonior, a co-sponsor of the\nbill.\n\n   The bill's other co-sponsor, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said\nhe was confident Congress will pass the proposed legislation.\n\n   ``Most members of Congress have no idea that this is allowed,\nand when I tell them about it, they're outraged and ask immediately\nhow they can help,'' he said.\n\n   Also on Thursday Kiareldeen reiterated his previous testimony\nthat he is not political or religious, does not know any of the men\nconvicted in the bombing, and did not know who Reno was until he\nwas arrested.\n\n   ``I just want to live my life,'' he said.\n\n   Kiareldeen's lawyer, David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown\nUniversity, said it was ``unbelievable'' that the INS is continuing\nto use its secret evidence authority after a judge ruled it was\nunconstitutional.\n\n   Referring to the two dozen similar INS cases in recent years,\nCole said it was a ``tragedy'' that Kiareldeen ``lost more than a\nyear of his life, and, yet, there are many others still sitting in\njail without the right to even see the evidence that's keeping them\nthere.''\n\n   Aly R.
