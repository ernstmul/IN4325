Specifically,\nhe added, he has asked ``why do certain areas of the brain process\nspecific tasks,'' such as information for seeing, hearing, and\ntouching.\n\n   In light of all the new discoveries about the importance of\ngenes in determining now the body operates, Sur said he wanted to\nfind out whether the brain's specialized areas are innately that\nway.\n\n   The animals used in the experiments were ferrets, which are born\nvery early in their development _ at a point comparable to the late\nsecond or early third trimester in humans, Sur said.\n\n   In delicate surgery, the scientists rerouted nerves coming from\nthe back of the ferrets' eyes so that they led to the primary\nauditory center, which is reserved for nerve impulses from the\nears.\n\n   When they matured, testing showed that the ferrets could respond\nto visual information _ juice spouts placed in different positions,\nfor example _ that was processed by the formerly hearing-oriented\nbrain structures.\n\n   And other experiments showed that the auditory brain structures\nhad undergone physical changes, so they more closely resembled the\nvisual centers of the brain.\n\n   But how does receiving different nerve impulses create all this\nchange? That's still being studied, Sur said.\n\n   ``It's difficult to imagine intuitively how sound might have the\nproperties of vision, and I don't have a good sense of how that\nmight be,'' he said.\n\n   The scientists did the brain rewiring just after the animals\nwere born. It will take more research to find out how long the\nbrain is so flexible.\n\n   Jon Kaas, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University who\nstudies similar questions, said the reports ``are major papers''\nthat challenge the recent emphasis on the power of genes.\n\n   ``I think it will push people back toward more consideration of\nenvironmental factors in creating normal brain organization,'' Kaas\nsaid.\n\n   Michael Merzenich, a researcher at the University of California\nin San Francisco, wrote in an article accompanying the Nature\nreports, that the ``fascinating papers'' provide ``some of the most\ncompelling evidence yet for the exquisite sensitivity of cortical\n(higher brain) development to external cues.''\n","Headline":"\nSTUDY DOWNPLAYS ROLE OF GENES IN STIMULATING BRAIN \n","Text":["\n   Young animals with ``rewired'' brains proved able to see using\nstructures in the brain normally reserved for interpreting sounds,\nMIT scientists report.\n","\n   The experiments showed that areas of the brain designed by\nnature to perform one highly specialized task can adapt to doing\nanother simply by being exposed to different information.\n","\n   ``This is a profound discovery that addresses age-old questions\nabout whether the brain is genetically programmed or shaped by the\nenvironment,'' said Mriganka Sur, professor and head of the\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology.\n","\n   Other researchers said the results challenge current thinking by\nshowing how powerfully information from the environment can\noverride the effects of genes in shaping the brain as it develops.\n","\n   In practical terms, they said this newly revealed ``plasticity''\nof the brain might be used to recruit healthy parts of the brain to\ntake over the tasks of areas damaged by accident or illness.\n","\n   Sur and his colleagues are authors of two papers about their\ndiscoveries being published in the journal Nature.\n","\n   In an interview, Sur said he has been working for a decade on\nthe question of ``how the brain becomes the brain.''
