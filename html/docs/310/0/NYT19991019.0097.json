The pink ball that teacher\nDorothy Casey shows him prompts Kenedy to thrust out his short arms\nto grab. As foster grandmother Lois Manor sings the pattycake\nrhyme, Kenedy's eyes widen and he flashes an open-mouth,\ntwo-toothed grin.\n\n   What's going on in Kenedy's tiny brain as he soaks in all the\nactivity is the focus of a new debate among scientists and advocacy\ngroups over what happens in a child's brain in the first three\nyears of life and what, if anything, parents can do to make their\nchildren smarter.\n\n   A tidal wave of information and news reports on how young\nchildren's minds develop has spurred a plethora of child-rearing\nmagazines and organizations and a burgeoning industry of\neducational toys, games, CDs, books and other materials.\n\n   Along with car seats and diaper pails, parents now find videos\nthat boast they can make children smarter or learn faster.\nClassical music CDs are hawked with claims that playing them will\nimprove a baby's IQ. Graphically patterned crib mobiles are touted\nas providing the right visual stimuli for newborns.\n\n   ``It is now clear that what a child experiences in the first few\nyears of life largely determines how his brain will develop and how\nhe will interact with the world throughout his life,'' says a\nbrochure by Zero to Three Foundation, a national advocacy\norganization in the early childhood development movement. The\nmovement's key tenets include that what a child learns in the\nearliest years lasts forever, and that unrepeatable opportunities\nfor sculpting a child's brain occur only during the first three\nyears.\n\n   Amid the clamor has come criticism that such claims and\nstatements are largely myth.\n\n   John Bruer, author of the recently published ``The Myth of the\nFirst Three Years,'' says that purveyors of the ``myth'' _ whom he\nidentifies as the media, advocacy groups such as Zero to Three and\nI Am Your Child, and some politicians _ have misinterpreted\nselected pieces of rather old brain science to support their views\nabout early child development, parenting practices and child-care\nstandards.\n\n   ``Neuroscience provides no evidence that the first three years\nare a critical or the critical period'' of a child's life, said\nBruer, also president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation of St.\nLouis, which specializes in education and child development.\n\n   Other critics are not quite as harsh, but they agree there has\nbeen overstatement about growing better brains in children.\n\n   ``I think it's wonderful for babies to listen to Mozart. It's\ntremendous for parents to be spending more time talking to their\nchildren,'' said Jack Shonkoff, dean of the Heller Graduate School\nat Brandeis University in Massachusetts and a pediatrician. ``What\nI'm against are beliefs that if we spend money on this kind of toy\nor game, that we will create smarter babies. ... Hogwash.''\n\n   Passion for the new early child learning practices runs high. In\nTexas, First Lady Laura Bush has made early childhood education her\npersonal cause and helped organize a conference around it. Other\nstates give classical music recordings to newborns or require\nstate-funded day-care centers to play it. Vice President Al Gore\nhas made universal preschool a plank in his presidential campaign\nplatform.\n\n   Such devotees fear Bruer's criticism may undo what they believe\ntheir message has accomplished.\n\n   ``Just when we are getting parents to pay attention, he writes\nin and says, `Don't bother,''' said Jill McRae, who coordinates\ncommunity outreach for the Connections Resource Center in Austin.\nThe center provides free information on child care and child\nrearing and holds parenting classes on various topics, including\nbrain development.\n\n   ``It bothers me,'' McRae said, ``that he would halt what I see\nas progress.''\n\n   ``Pfft.''\n\n   Kenedy makes a ras-- berry at caregiver Dorothy Casey at the\nEbenezer center.\n\n   ``Pfft,'' she raspberries back.\n\n   ``Hello? It's for Kenedy,'' she says, as she hands him the\nreceiver of a pink plastic toy phone.\n\n   ``They tell us to make gestures and move our mouths because they\nlike that,'' said Casey, 57, relating some of the lessons of her\nchild development studies.\n\n   She did such things while raising her two sons, but not because\nscientific research said to. ``You know what babies are supposed to\ndo, and so you do what comes normally,'' she said.\n\n   But she added that what she's learned about how children's\nbrains get wired, or don't, in response to their environment and\nstimulation has made her more diligent about her interaction with\nyoung children.\n\n   The teachings of the early childhood movement are evident at the\nEbenezer center, on East 10th Street, which cares for infants to\n5-year-olds. Each classroom has a radio/cassette recorder, and\nteachers play Mozart, usually at nap time. Gospel and Latin music\nalso are played.\n\n   Ebenezer has always played music, ``but since all the research\nhas come out, I have been acquiring tapes, especially Mozart,''\nsaid center director Karlene Bennett.\n\n   She also may suggest exercises from books such as ``Brain Games\nfor Babies.'' The book includes games such as Follow the Action, in\nwhich parents make different expressions and faces to their\nchildren to develop vision and hearing, and Where Is the Sound? in\nwhich parents hide a musical toy and try to get their baby to look\nin its direction. The book says this game will heighten a baby's\nawareness and help wire his or her brain.\n\n   The games, the interaction and the contact have always been\nstressed at Ebenezer, Bennett said, but reports on brain science\nhave strengthened her belief that the practices profoundly affect\nher wards' minds.\n\n   ``I like what brain development (research) does; it really\nfocuses on the child,'' Bennett said. ``If this was not important,\nwe could just sit here and just watch them.''\n\n   At the root of the controversy is what scientists know or don't\nknow about how the human brain develops.\n\n   There is wide consensus that from about birth through at least\nthe first year, an infant develops trillions of synapses _ the\nconnections between brain cells, or neurons. At birth, infants have\nthe same synaptic density _ the number of synapses in theircortical\ntissue _ as adults. Rapid synapse formation following birth hits a\nplateau at puberty, and then synapse densities decline to adult\nlevels.\n\n   Scientists also know that there are important periods during\nwhich, given the right stimulation, brain circuitry develops.\n\n   Beyond that, there is much disagreement.\n\n   For example, some groups and marketers have tried to link the\nnumber of synapses with intelligence and maintain that the amount\nof parental interaction with a child controls synapse formation.\n\n   But Bruer and other researchers say rapid synaptic formation is\nlargely the result of genetics, not environment. He and others say\nit's a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of scientific findings\nto say that synapse growth can be encouraged with stimulation, or\nthat when rapid synapse formation ends, so does the opportunity for\nlearning certain skills.\n\n   ``We do not know how the micro-organization of the brain is\naffected by experiences a child has in early years,'' Bruer said.\n\n   Alison Gopnik, a psychology professor and author of ``The\nScientist in the Crib,'' agrees. Scientists do not believe that\nbabies are ``stimulus response machines, where you have to put a\npenny in at the right moment to get a gum ball,'' she said. But she\nsays that behavioral science shows children learn a lot and learn\nvery complex ideas in their early years, such as that some of the\nfigures moving around them are other people.\n\n   Bruer and others say that while there are key periods for the\nearly development of vision, hearing and language, these systems\ndevelop fine in any normal environment. The periods have different\ntime spans, some extending into adolescence, others tapering\ngradually.\n\n   ``As far as we know, there are no critical periods for using\ncomputers, learning a musical instrument or even for social and\nemotional development. Claims that children learn more and more\nquickly at this time than at other times in their life have not\nbeen substantiated either by brain or behavioral science,'' Bruer\nsaid.\n\n   Supporters of early childhood theories agree that there has been\nsome overstatement of what neuroscience shows, but they say Bruer\nhimself goes too far in what he paints as myth.\n\n   ``I think that he has as one of his basic premises that the\nneuroscientist evidence has been overstated. I do not quarrel with\nthat,'' said Matthew Melmed, executive director of Zero to Three.\nBut Melmed also says Bruer oversimplifies the messages of his group\nand I Am Your Child, which was founded by filmmaker Rob Reiner.\n\n   ``My response to Bruer is there is very strong empirical and\nclinical evidence that the first three years of life are\nvaluable,'' Melmed said. ``Cognitive pathways are laid, and those\nare central to who we become as adults. This brain science issue is\nnot where we at Zero to Three or other researchers are focusing or\nstaking our positions.''\n\n   Melmed said his group does not tell parents that the first three\nyears of a child's life are the critical period for learning. But\nhe says it does consider those years akin to laying the foundation\nof a house.\n\n   ``What we say is during the first three years, they create the\nfoundation for everything that follows,'' Melmed said. ``That\ndoesn't mean that it's over after 3, but we think it's critically\nimportant for the public to know you learn a tremendous amount by\nthe time you are 3 and your expectations of the world are being\nformed and who you become as an adult are being formed by how\npeople interact with you or don't.''\n\n   The criticism has not prompted any changes in I Am Your Child\nliterature or messages, said Ellen Gilbert, director and cofounder\nof the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based national education campaign on\nearly childhood development. Last year, the group was successful in\ngetting voters to approve a tax on cigarettes in California to\nraise revenue for early child development projects.\n\n   ``I'm very confident that what we are promoting _ even if you\nwere to throw every bit of science out the door _ we are promoting\nwhat we should be promoting to parents,'' Gilbert said. ``It's\nadvice for parents to be involved in their children's lives ...\nAnyone who's raised a child gets it and doesn't need scientific\ncharts.''\n\n   Charles Nelson, a University of Minnesota professor of child\npsychology, neuroscience and pediatrics, said the emphasis on the\nearly years is pressuring parents and filling them with anxiety\nabout making a mistake that could affect their children for life.\n\n   ``It's setting parents up to feel nothing but guilt,'' said\nNelson, whose praise for Bruer's work is on the book's jacket.\n``All new parents feel typically overwhelmed, and they lack the\nconfidence to be a good parent, and this is exactly the type of\nthing to make that worse.''\n\n   Shonkoff, the Brandeis dean, said the debate, in the end, is\nprobably confusing parents more. The points they should remember,\nhe said, are that the first three years are important.\n\n   ``So are the next three years,'' he said, ``and the next three\nyears and the next three years after that.''\n\n   Suzanne Gamboa writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,\nTexas.
