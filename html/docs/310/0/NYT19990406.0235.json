Kanell\n      c. 1999 Cox News Service\n\n   ATLANTA _ They are the earthbound hardware that makes the\nwireless magic happen. But they are also expensive and ugly _\nunless properly disguised. They are the cell phone towers.\n\n   Around metro Atlanta, about 1,200 towers are scattered in a\nvariety of trappings, most obvious but many concealed or\ncamouflaged. Some are designed to look like pine trees, billboards\nor utility poles, and others are hidden inside church steeples.\nHundreds more just look like the stark, metallic eyesores they are.\n\n   For years, resistance by some neighborhoods to installation of a\ntower has paralleled the growing urge to use cell phones _ often in\nthe same neighborhoods. Areas of Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood,\nfor example, are rife with cell phone users and also a lousy place\nto get a connection. Increasingly, there has been both a\nproliferation of cell phone towers and a greater effort to mask\ntheir appearance.\n\n   But when the nation's nearly 70 million wireless phone users hit\nthe talk button on their mobile phones, completion of the calls\ndepends on being close enough to one of those cell sites. If the\nrange is right, they are linked to a cell site on some tower, and\nthe signal passed along via wire or by another wireless signal and\nthe call is connected.\n\n   Close enough can mean three to six miles _ or somewhat farther\naway if you are driving relatively flat stretches of an interstate\nhighway. And if you are stuck in traffic, punching your phone pad\nalong with others alongside you, be warned that a typical cell site\ncan handle only about 50 or 60 calls at once. But a tower can hold\nmany cell sites from different companies.\n\n   In Atlanta, one of the nation's top five wireless cities with at\nleast one cell phone for every three people, the towers get a lot\nof use. Most people, including many wireless customers, probably\ngive the towers no thought _ unless there is a plan to put one in\nthe neighborhood. Some people don't even realize that towers are\ncarrying the signals, believing instead their words are bouncing\noff satellites high above the earth.\n\n   But the increasingly ubiquitous wireless phone depends on\ntransmitters much closer to the ground. And the ownership of the\ntowers themselves is a business, like owning the wires that carry\nland-line calls.\n\n   Like the wires that carry local calls, most cell towers were\nfirst built and owned by the company selling the service to the\nconsumer. In Atlanta, the only two wireless competitors for more\nthan a decade were BellSouth and AirTouch Communications.\n\n   ``In the early going, you wanted the best possible location\nbecause there were only two of us,'' said Jeff Battcher, BellSouth\nspokesman. ``It was a competitive, strategic issue.''\n\n   The field has since grown more crowded, and tower dynamics have\nshifted.\n\n   In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has been\nauctioning off more wireless licenses using new parts of the\nspectrum. Now, Atlanta has seven providers: the originals plus\nPowertel, AT&T, Sprint, Nextel and Southern LINC.\n\n   That has changed the business of towers.\n\n   It took more than a century for phone lines to start carrying\ncalls for rival companies, and it still happens only on a fraction\nof calls. By contrast, the cellular industry is barely two decades\nold and the towers are increasingly being shared by competitors.\nFind a tower in a place where lots of people use cellular phones\nand chances are, it will hold transmission equipment from several\ncompanies.\n\n   Maintaining a tower costs money, but by leasing out space to\nvarious wireless providers, the owner can often reap far more in\nrevenue. The average wireless company pays between $1,200 and\n$1,800 a month to lease space on another company's cell tower.\nThose leases can add up.\n\n   For instance, a cell site in Pittsburgh owned by Crown Castle\nInternational reportedly has more than 100 different companies and\nagencies leasing space. The result is well over $1 million per\nmonth in revenue for just one tower.\n\n   But even a more modest setting, where a tower holds, say five\nsites, means income of $6,000 to $9,000 a month. Maintenance of a\ncell tower can be minimal: cut the lawn, paint the tower, change\nthe lights. ... The chance to make a killing seems clear _ so why\nwould companies be selling their towers?\n\n   And selling them they are _ for some big money.\n\n   In December, Houston-based Crown Castle bought 1,400 Bell\nAtlantic towers for $610 million. Two months later, Nextel sold\nabout 2,000 towers to SpectraSite for $560 million in cash and 17\npercent ownership of the company (ownership of SpectraSite, that\nis.) In March, BellSouth sold 1,850 of its towers to Crown Castle.\nOnly days later, West Point-based Powertel sold 650 towers for $275\nmillion, also to Crown Castle.\n\n   Most of those deals call for the tower company to build hundreds\nor even thousands of additional towers for the carrier. For the\ncellular customer, the transaction will be invisible. Calls go\nthrough as usual. The phone companies will keep their cell sites on\nthe towers, but will lease space back from the tower company.\n\n   Powertel will pay $1,800 a month for use of each tower it has\nsold to Crown Castle. Nextel will pay $1,600 a month to\nSpectraSite. BellSouth will pay Crown Castle $1,200 a month.\n\n   Spokespersons for Crown Castle in Houston and American Tower\nCorp. in Boston were unavailable for comment.\n\n   The industry evidently sees towers as a good investment _ but\nnot a certainty. Find a good spot, where there is lots of phone\ntraffic or where it's hard to get permission for a second tower _\nand sit back to count a healthy stream of cash from a tower crowded\nwith competitors' equipment. Yet many towers are a lot lonelier\nthan that.\n\n   BellSouth has more than 300 towers in metro Atlanta, and more\nthan half are home to BellSouth equipment only. So why would Crown\nCastle be so eager to buy those towers? The answer seems to be that\na tower company might not be profitable now, but it can get funding\nfrom investors who expect a big payoff. On the other hand, a\ncellular company might prefer to have the cash now, especially if\nthe deal will mean stable, predictable costs.\n\n   Judith Lockwood, editor of Wireless Week, said the increasingly\ncutthroat competition for wireless customers puts a premium on good\ncoverage, so many carriers are frantically expanding the\n``footprint'' in which they provide service.\n\n   That expansion is costly. Construction of a new tower costs an\naverage of $185,000, Lockwood said. ``I think it's mostly a\nfinancial consideration.''\n\n   By that measure, a new carrier's desire to duplicate the towers\nin metro Atlanta would cost more than $220 million. As an added\nbonus, the leasing strategy lets the carrier avoid costly,\ntime-consuming fights with neighborhood groups and zoning boards\nfor the right to erect a new tower.\n\n   To meet the surge for wireless demand, a company might build a\ntower. But it's quicker and cheaper to co-locate, that is, to put\ncell sites on someone else's towers _ assuming there are towers in\nthe area the company wants to serve.\n\n   On the other hand, a company that already owns towers can see in\nthem a quick way to pick up cash _ lots of it, Lockwood said.\n``It's every important to use whatever cash is available to build\nout the system. There is a white-hot competition and coverage is a\nvery important factor for consumers.''\n\n   BellSouth apparently wanted its money up-front, deciding it was\ndistracting, expensive and maybe even counterproductive to look for\nmore revenue by marketing space on its towers to competitors.\n\n   ``It is still a business that is very young and speculative,''\nsaid BellSouth's Battcher. ``Why not sell the tower to another\ncompany and let them take the risk?''\n\n   Kristin Brinkman, marketing manager for Nextel in Georgia, said\nthe company made the decision to sell after realizing that its core\nbusiness was phones.\n\n   Nextel is more interested in building its nationwide business\nnow rather than trying to find long-term income from leasing space,\nshe said. ``If we can co-locate _ like any good business would _ we\nwill be able to reduce costs. It's more cost-effective. Others have\nmore expertise in regards to towers than we would.''\n\n   On the other hand, some companies have tenaciously held their\ntowers.\n\n   Sprint, for example, has more than 2,000 towers and other cell\ncites already. The Kansas City, Mo.-based company plans to build\nmore than 1,000 more, according to Bill D'Agostino, vice president\nof Sprint's tower organization.\n\n   The company, which is trying to build a nationwide service, is\nlooking for ways to put its sites on existing towers. When it\nbuilds its own, it is happy to have the added income from rivals\nleasing space, he said.\n\n   ``We think there is still tremendous upside in remaining in the\ntower co-location business. That way we can retain some control\nover the assets for Sprint's future use.''\n\n   Michael E. Kanell writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ They are the earthbound hardware that makes the\nwireless magic happen.
