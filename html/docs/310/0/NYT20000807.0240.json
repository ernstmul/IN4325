Outside, nine floors below the urban\nmultistory medical school, the city is crippled by fractured\nstreets and sidewalks under repair.\n\n   It's an unsettling thought that someday, in the normal course of\nthe weakening of human bones, the pedestrians scurrying around the\nconstruction outside may not be able to walk at all.\n\n   Unlike the old streets of Houston, the old human infastructure\ncannot be as easily rebuilt.\n\n   Bone disappears as we age. It becomes less dense, more porous.\nOnce adult bone is gone, it is gone forever. No one knows how to\nrebuild it. At least not yet.\n\n   Inside the Baylor labs, French-born Gerard Karsenty, physician,\nprofessor and researcher, and a team of other scientists are\nworking on a project that may help us to rebuild our own\ninfrastructure from the inside out.\n\n   The doctor, a detective of sorts, one who tracks missing bone,\nsays he has discovered that the brain has the power to signal the\nskeleton to rebuild itself.\n\n   It could be, if Karsenty can figure out how to signal the brain\nto rebuild bone, that this discovery may someday lead to a cure for\nosteoporosis.\n\n   Osteoporosis, a gradual loss of bone density as the body ages,\nleaves skeletons more fragile and susceptible to fractures,\nincluding debilitating breaks to hips and spines. Karsenty\nestimates that 28 million Americans _ particularly thin, elderly\nCaucasian and Asian women _ have fragile bones, and of those about\nhalf have become crippled by it.\n\n   Although osteoporosis strikes far more women than men, more\nwhites than blacks, more old than young, the disease shows up\nacross racial and age lines.\n\n   Osteoporosis is insidious, silent. Not many people who have it\neven know they do, not until they get a serious fracture. By then,\nthe bone is gone forever.\n\n   All doctors can do now is recommend preventative steps to stop\nfurther bone loss. The National Osteoporosis Foundation says\ncalcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise and strength training\nall prevent bones from degrading. Four medications also are on the\nmarket to prevent further bone loss for those who have been found\nto have osteoporosis. Estrogen-replacement therapy is considered\nhelpful in preventing excessive bone loss in post-menopausal women,\nalthough it carries with it negative side effects such as the\nincreased risk for breast and uterine cancers.\n\n   A cure would help millions. Karsenty is on the path.\n\n   _\n\n   Fifty-two years ago, in France, Gerard Karsenty was born into a\nfamily where medicine is a tradition. His father was an\nopthalmologist _ an eye doctor. The younger Karsenty wanted\nsomething more.\n\n   ``A physician delivers a treatment. I want to create a\ntreatment,'' he says.\n\n   What he wants to do, he says, is study the core of our being,\nthe very framework that holds everything else together, the very\nskeleton that degrades as we age.\n\n   He studied medicine at the University of Paris, graduating in\n1984. The most prestigious medical research institutions in the\nUnited States saw his promise. As a post-doctoral fellow, he\nstudied molecular, cellular and nutritional endocrinology at the\nNational Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and genes at the\nNational Cancer Institute before moving to the University of Texas\nM.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston in 1987. In 1998, he moved\nto Baylor as a researcher and as a professor, where he teaches the\nnext generation of doctors about human and molecular genetics.\n\n   MORE\n\n   Karsenty, gray-haired, sturdy of frame, not a top candidate for\nosteoporosis himself, has devoted his research to the study of\nbones. You can ask him, ``Do you have anyone in your family who has\nosteoporosis?'' and he will look at you like he doesn't know how\ncould you possibly even ask that. And he will say, ``Everyone gets\nosteoporosis.'' If they live long enough, he explains, because\neventually bone will break down.\n\n   About two years ago, Karsenty decided to link the most\nwell-known facts about bones and bone loss in a study with his\ncolleagues at Baylor, scientists Patricia Ducy, Shu Takeda and\nJianhe Shen, as well as five researchers from the University of\nHamburg, Germany, and one from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n   If outlined on a blackboard, their hypothesis would look\nsomething like this:\n\n   1. Bone mass is affected by menopause. When the hormone estrogen\nis switched off, bones become more breakable.\n\n   2. Bone mass is affected by obesity. Fat people are at less of a\nrisk than thin people. In 1994, the medical community became aware\nof a hormone called leptin. Leptin works through the brain to\nregulate weight. If we don't have much leptin, we are fat.\n\n   Hypothetical questions: If the hormone estrogen affects bone\nmass, could the hormone leptin also affect bone mass?\n\n   So for about two years, Karsenty and the team _ working in three\nseparate labs in Texas, Maryland and Germany _ have been studying\nmice. About 1,000 of the small rodents, scurrying through the\nsawdust in glass aquariumlike cages in the labs, are observed.\n\n   They study mice that have no ability to reproduce, and they\nstudy mice that can reproduce. Males and females are studied.\n\n   At one point, a former Baylor public affairs employee writes a\npress release that says the sterile mice studied are menopausal,\nbut really, they are not. The mice lack hormones, just as\nmenopausal women do. But the nonreproducing mice in the study have\nbeen sterile since birth.\n\n   The researchers inject leptin into the hypothalamus region of\nthe mice's brains. By studying mice bones under a microscope, they\ndiscover that when the hormone leptin is present, the bones do not\nrebuild. When the hormone leptin is in low supply, the bones get\nstronger.\n\n   The research represents a milestone, said current Baylor\nspokesperson Lynn Foltin. For the first time, scientists can say\nthat the brain controls bone mass. Bone is not kept strong only by\nnutrition, weight-bearing exercise and strength-training. Hormones\naffecting our brains also are at work.\n\n   The research opens a new door for more researchers to enter.\n\n   ``Osteoporosis may be a brain disease as much as it is a bone\ndisease,'' Karsenty said.\n\n   Is this the cure? Not yet. It may be pointing researchers that\nway, but there is a big kink to work out.\n\n   _\n\n   As it turns out, it is the roly-poly lab mice that have great\nbones.\n\n   They are obese little guys, weighing 60 grams instead of the\nnormal 20 grams.\n\n   So the challenge for Karsenty and his team is to figure out how\nto regulate leptin without making mice obese. They also must figure\nout how the brain sends messages about leptin to the bone.\n\n   Studies with humans have not been done. Karsenty said leptin and\nbone loss work the same way in mice as they do in people, so he is\nconfident the results can someday be transferred to human medicine.\n\n   Much work remains.\n\n   Karsenty's results so far have been reported in the medical\njournal Cell, and elsewhere. The study has met with everything from\ngreat joy to great incredulity, he said. But that's the way it is\nwith discoveries. Not everyone will be happy to be led off into a\nnew direction.
