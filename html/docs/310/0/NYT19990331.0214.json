Times News Service   \n\n   As part of a clampdown on news organizations last week, Yugoslav\npolice raided the offices of Radio B92, the single independent\nradio station in Belgrade, the capital city, and pulled the plug on\nits transmitter. Unfortunately for police, they had no way to pull\nthe plug on the Internet, where the radio station continues to put\nout its reports.\n\n   On March 24, police told the station that its broadcasts were\nviolating transmission laws and arrested the station's editor in\nchief, Veran Matic. He was released eight hours later. According to\nAri Schwartz, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and\nTechnology in Washington, Matic then began uploading reports onto\nthe Internet, where they can be accessed on a Web site,\nwww.opennet.org. (The station also maintains a Web site at\nwww.helpb92.-xs4all.nl.) The BBC downloaded the content and\nbroadcast it back into the Balkans by radio.\n\n   According to the Center for Democracy and Technology, B92\nbroadcasts music and news that is not officially sanctioned. In\nrecent years, the station has been shut down several times by\nYugoslav police.\n\n   Until its broadcasts were banned, most listeners in the United\nStates faced a language barrier _ except for a five-minute English\nprogram every morning, B92 broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian. But since\nthe ban, the Opennet Web site carries an English translation of its\nnews content, while the Helpb92 site contains some material in\nEnglish.\n\n   Schwartz said the experience of B92 shows that governments\ncannot easily stop the flow of information in the Internet age.\n``In today's day and age, it is much more difficult to censor,'' he\nsaid. ``Governments have to learn new ways of openness.''\n\n   Color-Coordinated Software to Go With Your iMac\n\n   With hardware vendors scrambling to create stylish peripherals\nto complement Apple Computer's trendy translucent iMac, it was\nprobably only a matter of time before software manufacturers\nfollowed suit. Grolier Interactive Inc. has just created a special\nedition of its popular multimedia encyclopedia CD-ROM that is\nspecifically tailored for iMac users.\n\n   The 1999 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia Deluxe 2-CD iMac\nEdition not only offers users a program interface that nicely\nmatches the original iMac's Bondi Blue case color, but also has\nbeen enhanced to take advantage of the machine's advanced video and\nstereo capabilities. The two-disk set contains 36,000 articles,\n15,000 pictures and graphics, and 1,200 maps, plus video and\ndigitally remastered sound clips. An additional 22,000 articles are\navailable through online access to two more encyclopedias.\n\n   The program will work on iMacs or Power Macs running Mac OS 8\n(or higher), with at least a 603/200 MHz processor. The program\nsells for $59.95, and the company is offering a $20 mail-in rebate\nuntil Aug. 31. And don't worry if you have one of the\nsecond-generation machines.

BIERSDORFER\n\n   Spanning the Continents\n\n   Paving the way for worldwide wireless phone use (and possibly\nsome whopping roaming charges), Motorola is introducing a new\nmobile telephone that can be used in the United States, Europe, the\nMiddle East and Asia.\n\n   The phone will be able to receive radio signals from the\npredominant digital frequencies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East\n(900 and 1,800 megahertz) and in the United States (1,900\nmegahertz). The phone will be available in the second quarter of\nthis year. The price has not yet been determined.\n\n   Until now, mobile phone users have not been able to use the same\nphone across continents, due to differing frequency standards. Yet\nMotorola's development is still just the beginning; it still does\nnot receive the 800 megahertz frequency, which is a predominantly\nanalog (as opposed to digital) frequency used by 85 percent of\nmobile phone users in the United States.\n\n   If this sounds confusing, that's because it is confusing, points\nout Herschel Schosteck, a wireless market analyst from Wheaton, Md.\nHowever, Schosteck said that the significance of the Motorola\nannouncement is that it paves the way for telephones to work across\nnumerous standards, technologies and radio frequencies _ and hence\nto make the situation far less confusing to consumers.\n\n   Before long, he said, wireless phones will work in many places\naround the globe. ``For the group of people who are international\ntravelers, this is going to be very useful,'' he said.\n\n   An Automotive CD Player That Uses Your Car Radio\n\n   The upside of the newest in-car CD player from Emerson is that\nit requires no installation. The downside is that there is a slim\nchance the CD player will play music in nearby cars, potentially\nleading to some ugly music-related road rage.\n\n   The Emerson Research Personal CD Player attaches to speakers not\nwith wires but by radio waves. It sends a signal to the car\nantenna, which in turns directs the signal to an unused frequency\non the car's radio dial; the signal then is played through the\ncar's speakers as if it were coming from a radio station.\n\n   The only catch is that it is possible the signal could be picked\nup by neighboring cars. It is unlikely, but possible, that use of\nthe device could lead to some confrontations by the side of the\nroad between fans of classical music, rap and country and western.\n\n   nn\n\n   Wake-Up Calls at Home, Complete With Advertising\n\n   Thanks to the Internet, deep sleepers can get the same wake-up\nservice they enjoy at hotels for free at home. But they'll have to\nput up with the dulcet tones of early morning marketing.\n\n   A new web site, www.mrwakeup.com, allows people to program in\ntheir phone numbers so they can be called back at a specified date\nand time. A computer then places the call, and the recipient is\ngreeted with a synthesized computer voice intoning a reminder that\nit is time to rise.\n\n   In addition to wake-up calls, the service can be programmed to\nprovide short news blurbs, weather updates, horoscopes and 125-word\nreminders the recipient types in and that are read by a\ntext-to-voice synthesizer.\n\n   The service is free, with a catch. Each call begins with a\nmessage from the call's sponsor; among the sponsors during the\ntwo-month old consumer test are Amazon.com and Starbucks.\n\n   Eduardo Yeh, president of iPing Inc., the New York company\nbehind the site, said he is planning to offer different voice types\nfor the call. ``Soon you'll have a variety of voices, including\nfemale, one like a comedian, and someone who sounds crazy, like\nnuts,'' Yeh said.\n\n   Turning a Single Computer Into an At-Home Network\n\n   For homes where family members or roommates constantly fight\nover use of the computer, a California company offers an answer\nshort of group therapy: a buddy system that shares hard drives.\nSpecifically, the technology, which goes for $149 from Vega Systems\nin Emeryville, Calif., allows people to use a single computer while\nworking on different monitors, using separate keyboards and mice.\n\n   The system works through a VGA card inserted into a slot inside\nthe computer. The card is a attached to a cable that runs to a\nconnector box into which the second mouse, keyboard and monitor can\nbe hooked.\n\n   The technology uses a feature in Windows '98 and '95 that allows\nusers to work concurrently on two separate applications, such as\nword processing and a spreadsheet, but in different windows.
