Times News Service   \n\n   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The Big Bang of telecommunications is now on\nthe horizon, the long-awaited moment when a third-generation of\nInternet-based mobile phone applications and services will sweep\nacross the world, changing personal communications in a more\nprofound way than the arrival of the personal computer changed\ncomputing two decades ago.\n\n   At least, that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at\nEricsson in Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless\ntelecommunications equipment in the world. But the third-generation\nphones they are talking about, so-called 3G phones, are still\nseveral years away for most of the world, according to research\nscientists and wireless services developers here and in Helsinki.\nThe first-generation analog phones are still in widespread use,\nafter all, especially in the United States, and the second\ngeneration of digital phones are still gaining in popularity.\n\n   When the 3G mobile Internet devices do arrive, they may not even\nbe recognizable as phones, because voice conversations will be just\none of their many capabilities. In fact, the researchers here do\nnot even call them phones, preferring instead to call them mobile\ncommunicators or mobile terminals. Eventually they will replace\ncell phones, the researchers say, allowing people to tap into a\nseemingly endless array of personal services, at any time,\nanywhere.\n\n   But there are daunting technical, commercial and regulatory\nissues to resolve before the Big Bang is reality. Consumers,\nespecially in the United States, will have to wait through a\nsuccession of interim steps _ requiring a change of phones at each\nstep, of course _ and wade through a morass of confusing terms and\nservices to get from 2G to 3G.\n\n   There is a seemingly insatiable demand for new mobile Internet\nservices here in Scandinavia, where most people over the age of 15\ncarry wireless phones, and in Japan, where more than 20,000 people\na day are signing up for Internet access through their phones. The\nnew 3G services will roll out first in these areas, where the\n``wireless lifestyle'' is already well established. In the United\nStates, where the Internet is closely associated with the personal\ncomputer and where mobile standards are fragmented, the wireless\nfuture is still slightly out of focus. But, the researchers here\npoint out, the early years of personal computing were also\nconfusing and frustrating, yet today the Internet and e-mail have\nbecome indispensable to tens of millions of people.\n\n   The key to 3G is speed, the ability to transmit and receive\ndigital data at rates of about 2 million bits per second, more than\n35 times faster than today's fastest dial-up personal computer\nmodems and more than 200 times the speed of most current handheld\nwireless data devices.\n\n   At 3G speeds, a pocket-size communicator could zoom beyond\nsimple voice calls and messaging to include mobile video\nconferencing, the routine use of video postcards, the delivery of\nCD-quality music, the storage and retrieval of personal\ninformation, as well as potentially endless variations on mobile\nelectronic commerce, or M-commerce.\n\n   ``Just as we did not foresee the development of e-mail, the\nWorld Wide Web or other popular services when the PC was first\nintroduced, we do not know what services will eventually emerge for\n3G,'' said Yrjo Neuvo, executive vice president and chief\ntechnology officer for Nokia's mobile phones division in Helsinki.\n``But we do know that they will come faster'' than they did for the\nPC, he said.\n\n   Shown in nonworking prototype form at Nokia's research center in\nHelsinki, the 3G phones are small enough to slip in a pocket. They\nwill not be held up against the ear as today's cell phones are, but\nrather held in the hand and operated either by tapping on the\ntouch-sensitive screen or by voice commands. The screen will\ndisplay icons that represent calendar, address book, stored files\nand other information familiar to people who today carry a handheld\ncomputer like a Palm or Pocket PC.\n\n   The device will also allow high-speed perusing of the World Wide\nWeb, modified to be displayed on a small color screen _ Web Lite,\nas some people here call it _ as well as instant access to news,\nimpulse ordering of goods and services, personal banking and stock\ntrading, multiplayer games, and the ability to send and receive\nmultimedia messages easily with people all over the world.\n\n   Unlike today's crazy quilt of incompatible wireless standards,\nwhich prevent most American cell phones from working elsewhere in\nthe world and even in different parts of the United States, the\ngoal of 3G developers is a single, unified global standard, known\nas Universal Mobile Telephone System, or UMTS.\n\n   Licenses for a handful of 3G installations have already been\ngranted in Japan and Europe, for astonishing amounts of money.\n``This is the second coming for the telecoms companies,'' said\nZaheed Hague, chief executive of Room33.com, a wireless application\ndeveloper here. ``They missed the Internet, and this time they\ndon't want to miss out.''\n\n   (MORE)    \nnn\n\n   Like hundreds of companies in Scandinavia, Room33 is focusing on\nan interim technology called Wireless Application Protocol, or WAP,\nan evolving international standard for delivering Internet data\nservices and advanced telephony to WAP-enabled phones, pagers,\nhandheld computers and other wireless devices.\n\n   The first WAP-enabled phones are just beginning to show up in\nthe United States, after a slow start in Europe. Motorola, the\nlargest American maker of cellular phones, said all of its new\nphones will be WAP-capable by the end of the year.\n\n   A somewhat similar but incompatible service called i-Mode is\nwildly popular in Japan, attracting more than 7 million users in 15\nmonths. Encouraged by such consumer enthusiasm, hundreds of\ncompanies here are developing WAP applications for everything from\nbanking and stock trading to ticketing services, control of\nindustrial robots, Internet search engines and entertainment.\n\n   For example, Codeonline, a start-up company in Espoo, Finland,\nis preparing to introduce a mobile entertainment application that\nwill let people play trivia games on their WAP phones. PicoFun, a\nStockholm-based startup, has a WAP-based game that lets phone users\ncompete in fantasy soccer leagues.\n\n   The idea of playing games on a phone may be curious to\nAmericans, where cell phones are still relatively rare compared\nwith Finland. But at Nokia, down the road in Espoo, executives\nproclaim with almost religious fervor that more people worldwide\nwill be reaching the Internet through wireless devices by 2003 than\nthrough personal computers. This is already the case in Japan.\n\n   Americans accustomed to browsing the World Wide Web on a big\ncolor computer screen over a high-speed link will find the WAP\nbrowser to be agonizingly slow and spare, with a clumsy,\nthumb-controlled user interface and a display that is suitable for\nonly a few lines of text and perhaps a small crude graphic.\n\n   The key to WAP, however, is the development of services that are\nexclusively for mobile users who need snippets of information or\nwho want to make simple transactions or requests from a mobile\nhandset. It does not require a fancy graphical interface to make a\ncredit card payment or book a train ticket from a WAP screen, for\nexample.\n\n   Early WAP users in Europe have complained that their wireless\nphone bills leap when they use the system, because it takes extra\ntime to connect to the Internet and navigate through a WAP service.\n\n   WAP will really take off, the developers say, when phones make\nthe transition from today's circuit-switched system, in which the\nuser has to dial into an Internet service, to a packet-based system\nthat is always connected to the Internet.\n\n   In a circuit-switched system, like the one used for most phone\ncalls today, a private line is established between the caller and\nthe recipient, and it remains open until the phone is hung up. It\nis like having a road reserved just for your car as you drive to\nthe store and back. The user is typically billed for the length of\ntime the private circuit is being used.\n\n   In a packet-based system, which is the basis of the Internet,\nvoice and data traffic is broken into chunks of digital bits, or\npackets, that travel over a shared common network by taking the\nmost efficient _ and thus least costly _ route. Using the car\nanalogy, any number of cars can share your lane, yet you arrive at\nyour destination just the same. The roads are always open, whether\nyou are driving or not.\n\n   In a packet-based wireless system, the user would pay either\naccording to the volume of bits that are sent and received, or on a\nsubscription basis for a fixed monthly fee. The pricing models are\nstill being decided.\n\n   ``The shift from circuit to packet systems is far more\nsignificant to consumers than was the shift from analog to\ndigital,'' said Bjorn Norhammar, manager of market development for\n3G communicators for Ericsson.\n\n   This transition to packet-based services is expected to begin\nlater this year in Europe, through a technology called General\nPacket Radio System. Based on 2G networks, GPRS is often called\n``two and a half G,'' signaling its status as a step between 2G and\ntrue 3G networks.\n\n   Although it is technically feasible that GPRS systems will have\na connection speed of up to 170 kilobits (thousands of bits) per\nsecond, Nokia says the first packet-radio systems will have a\nmaximum rate of 26 or 39 kbps. Still, that is faster than 2G\nphones, generally 9.6 kbps.\n\n   A variant of the packet-based system called Cellular Digital\nPacket Data, or CDPD, is being introduced in the United States by\nAT&T Wireless Services, under the Digital Pocket Net brand name.\nUsers of the Pocket Net service have free, unlimited access to\nabout 40 Web sites for tasks like finding directions, shopping for\nbooks and CD's, trading stocks, making flight reservations and\nchecking news headlines. However, the Pocket Net system has a speed\nlimit of about 19 kbps, and is seen as a transition step toward\nGPRS, now primarily limited to phones based on European and Asian\nstandards.\n\n   One of the more intriguing features of 3G communicators will be\nlocality _ that is, the ability for the network to ``know'' where\nthe user is whenever the phone is on. Location-based services are\nbeing developed here, for example, to notify a subscriber to an\nonline dating service whenever another subscriber who matches a\ncertain profile is nearby.\n\n   Or, a subscriber could sign up for a service that allows shops\nor restaurants beam the digital equivalent of discount coupons to\nthe mobile device whenever the 3G customer is in the area. In\nanother example, a 3G device installed in a car would enable the\npolice to track it down if the car was stolen. Obviously, many\nprivacy issues remain to be resolved.\n\n   Although 3G communicators are still years away, researchers here\nare hard at work on 4G, which promises data rates of 100 megabits\nper second _ sufficient for video teleconferencing _ and wireless\nnetworking with televisions, garage door openers and other devices\nusing a technology called Bluetooth. But when Nokia officials were\nsetting up a computer presentation on Bluetooth and other future\nmobile technologies, they still had to fumble with cables and wait\nfor Windows to boot up.\n\n   ``If our phones took as long to turn on as Windows,'' Martin\nSandelin, a senior vice president at Nokia, said with a sigh, ``we\nwouldn't make as many phone calls.''\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nHEADING NORTH TO THE WIRELESS FUTURE \n","Text":["\n   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The Big Bang of telecommunications is now on\nthe horizon, the long-awaited moment when a third-generation of\nInternet-based mobile phone applications and services will sweep\nacross the world, changing personal communications in a more\nprofound way than the arrival of the personal computer changed\ncomputing two decades ago.\n","\n   At least, that is what they say at Nokia in Finland and at\nEricsson in Sweden, two of the largest makers of wireless\ntelecommunications equipment in the world.
