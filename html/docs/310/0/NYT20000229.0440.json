Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The state Department of Health cited Staten Island\nUniversity Hospital on Tuesday for 40 violations and fined the\nhospital $80,000 for failing to monitor and discipline its chief of\nneurosurgery, who twice in five years operated on the wrong sides\nof patients' brains.\n\n   The state's action was the harshest penalty and stiffest fine it\nhad imposed on a hospital in 15 years.\n\n   In January, the neurosurgeon, Dr. Ehud Arbit, bungled a cranial\nprocedure on a severely ill Staten Island patient who then died,\nHealth Commissioner Antonia C. Novello announced at a news\nconference Tuesday. Arbit was fired from Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nHospital in 1995 for operating on the wrong side of a patient's\nbrain after confusing two patients.\n\n   While the state investigation did not conclude that Arbit's\nsurgery caused the death of the Staten Island patient, it said that\none other patient of his had died after a questionable procedure,\nand that others had become disabled. In several instances, the\nstate said, the hospital did not report any of the medical errors,\nas it is required to do, and violated several provisions of New\nYork's health laws.\n\n   In addition to the fine, which the state said could not be\nappealed, Novello ordered the Staten Island hospital to hire an\noutside consultant to monitor the quality of care there.\n\n   The hospital issued a statement Tuesday, in which it said it had\ncooperated with state investigators and would work to improve its\nmonitoring system, in neurosurgery and throughout the hospital. It\nsaid it was preparing a line-by-line response to the state's\nfindings.\n\n   Arbit's lawyer, Anthony Scher, said Tuesday night, ``There was\nan investigation into this issue and it is absolutely clear that he\ndid not operate on the wrong side of the brain. I have not seen the\nstate report, but it seems to me that they also understand that\nthat is not the case.''\n\n   Several of Arbit's colleagues said in interviews that he had\nbeen unfairly maligned by other hospital workers as a result of\npolitical battles within the hospital.\n\n   The state began its investigation after receiving several\ncomplaints, and issued its findings Tuesday in a strongly worded\n23-page report outlining many allegations, all stemming from\nsurgical procedures performed by Arbit.\n\n   Investigators found that Arbit and the hospital failed to\nprepare for surgery properly. The state also cited the hospital for\nits decision to allow physicians' assistants to take critical roles\nduring surgery, performing duties that the state said should have\nbeen done by doctors. In one case, the state charged, Arbit sought\nthe medical advice of an equipment salesman for spinal plates\nduring an operation that was going badly. (The salesman, who was\nobserving the surgery, declined to answer.)\n\n   Novello's investigators also outlined, in charge by charge,\ngruesome details of what it said were botched operations. In the\ncase involving surgery on the wrong side of the brain, state\ninvestigators found that a 54-year-old patient, with multiple\nillnesses including brain and lung tumors, liver disease, diabetes\nand pancreatitis, went into the operating room. The state report\nsaid the patient's CAT scans were not brought into the operating\nroom, and that Arbit made an incision on the left cerebellum, only\nto be told by a physician's assistant that she recalled the tumor\nwas on the right side.\n\n   Arbit told state health investigators that he had intended all\nalong to remove the entire back of the skull, and that the side of\nthe placement of the first incision did not matter. He asserted\nthat he followed acceptable neurosurgical standards, the report\nsaid.\n\n   The patient, identified by those familiar with the case as\nJohnnie Artis, a security supervisor from Staten Island, fell into\na coma and died on Feb. 2.\n\n   Aside from that case, the most serious allegation in the state's\nreport involved treatment of a 21-year-old patient, who suffered\nfrom a brain tumor and was left to bleed excessively, the state\nsaid. The doctor had used a device that others complained produced\na fuzzy, unusable image, the state said. He switched from\nperforming a biopsy to brain surgery, catching other staff\noff-guard and ill prepared.\n\n   Because the anesthesiologist had not anticipated more than a\nbiopsy, the patient's blood was not typed, and he had not prepared\nto replace large quantities of blood, the report noted. A second\nprocedure was necessary to stop the bleeding, the state said. ``The\npatient was unresponsive after surgery and died several weeks\nlater,'' the report said.\n\n   Another case involved a patient requiring spinal surgery. An\nanesthesiologist and a physician's assistant told Department of\nHealth investigators that Arbit's hand slipped and lacerated the\npatient's spinal cord, leaving her partially paralyzed, according\nto the state's report. In another instance, the doctor and his\nstaff failed to perform proper follow-up blood work on a\n62-year-old patient, exposing her to high risk when she underwent\nadditional surgery, the state found.\n\n   nn\n\n   In the case involving the equipment salesman, a patient\ncomplained of weakness in her hands after an operation. A CAT scan\nrevealed loose screws on a plate that had been implanted in the\npatient's spine along the back of the neck, the state noted. Arbit\nfailed to replace the screws properly, the state said, at one point\nasking a medical equipment salesman in the operating room whether\nhe thought the plate was positioned correctly, the investigators\nfound.\n\n   These medical errors so disturbed the hospital's chief\nneurosurgery anesthesiologist that he refused to work with Arbit\nand complained to hospital officials, who declined to take action,\nthe state said.\n\n   Indeed, the state rebuked the hospital for failing to report\nthese cases and for failing to deal with them properly in internal\nreviews.\n\n   ``Our investigation found an alarmingly high number of\ndeficiencies in the hospital's controls and procedures that need to\nbe in place to ensure patients receive proper care,'' Novello said.\n``Worse yet,'' she added, the hospital failed to notify the state\nof any worrisome cases, nor did it move to discipline the doctor or\nproperly investigate the cases when alerted of them.\n\n   In its statement, Staten Island University Hospital officials\nsaid they would begin instituting new monitoring procedures to\nensure patient safety and quality of care within the next few days.\nBut the hospital cautioned that the state's Office of Professional\nMedical Conduct, which licenses physicians in the state and\ndisciplines doctors, had yet to complete interviews with all\npersonnel involved or to finish its investigation of Arbit.\n\n   Novello's announcement Tuesday of stiff fines and a slew of\nhealth violations underscored her decision to make the disciplining\nof doctors and quality of care monitoring at hospitals a hallmark\nof her tenure, which began in June. For instance, the state of New\nYork had only twice suspended a doctor's license before an\ninvestigation was completed, both times on Novello's watch and both\nin the last few months.\n\n   Arbit surrendered his license on Feb. 18. The other doctor who\nsurrendered his license while being investigated was Dr. Allan\nZarkin, who admitted to carving his initials into the stomach of a\npatient on whom he had performed a Caesarean section last fall.\n\n   Novello's tough stance comes at a time when President Clinton is\npressing states to adopt strict regulations for reporting medical\nerrors, after a recent report that found medical errors kills\nhundreds of thousands of people each year. ``I want to be perfectly\nclear,'' Novello said Tuesday. ``When and if the Department of\nHealth finds that a hospital is not operating up to high standards,\nwe will move swiftly and decisively.''\n\n   The state began its investigation into Staten Island University\nHospital on Feb. 9, when it received complaints that Arbit had\noperated on the wrong side of Artis' brain. When state\ninvestigators contacted the hospital, Novello said, its\nadministrators told them, ``it was a rumor,'' she added.\n\n   The state made an unannounced visit to the hospital the next\nday, during which several hospital staff members volunteered\ninformation about the surgeries, Novello said. A week later,\ninvestigators returned and found corroborating evidence, she said.\nOn Friday, the state concluded its ``intensive investigation'' into\nthe hospital, the commissioner said, concluding that ``serious\nquality problems'' existed.\n\n   Arbit was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nCancer Center at the time he mistakenly operated on the healthy\nright side of the brain of Rajeswari Ayyappan, the 59-year-old\nmother of a famous Indian film star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of\nthe left side, where a cancerous tumor was situated.\n\n   After the error was discovered, the patient, who had gone to the\nhospital with a very poor prognosis, had the tumor removed at New\nYork Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She later died in India, and\nArbit was fired from Sloan-Kettering. The state gave him one year's\nprobation in that case.
