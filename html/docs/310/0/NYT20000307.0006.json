Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last\nmonth and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper today,\nis meant to warn Taiwan away from formal independence and push it\ntoward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland.

And many Boeing\nengineers, most on strike for the first time in their lives, say\nthey are still stunned at how unified their group has become in the\nface of its protest against the jet manufacturer. The increasingly\nbitter protest by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees\nin Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the largest strikes by\nwhite-collar workers against a private company in years. For\nnational labor leaders, who have rushed in to help out the striking\nengineers, the strike is clearly seen as an opportunity to make\ninroads in its hopes to organize a potentially vast sector of the\nworkforce.

There is a plot, and they are in it.\nThere's not much doubt who will win Tuesday's primaries in Georgia;\nboth Bush and Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the\nfour major candidates has even bothered to campaign here on a\nregular basis. But neither inevitability nor prosperity seems to\nhave dimmed Newton County's interest in this election. No one here\nhas seen a single political ad or shaken a candidate's hand, yet\nvoters are planning to show up at the polls, and they won't be\nmaking a decision in last-minute frustration.
