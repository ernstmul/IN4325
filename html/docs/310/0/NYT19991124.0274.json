LEWIS   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   When Apple introduced the iBook several months ago as the\nportable version of its popular iMac desktop computer, one of its\nmore intriguing features was a built-in radio antenna that in\ntheory enabled the iBook to connect to the Internet and share files\nwith other Macintosh computers without wires.\n\n   But like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project,\nwhich scans radio emissions coming from deep space for patterns\nthat might indicate alien intelligence, and perhaps even explain\nthe Pokemon phenomenon, the antenna in my iBook picked up only\nstatic.\n\n   Apple finally released the missing components last week to allow\nthe iBook to communicate with other silicon-based life forms: the\n$299 AirPort base station and the $99 AirPort wireless networking\ncard. They were well worth the wait. The AirPort wireless\nnetworking system is confirmation that there is intelligent life in\nthe computer industry.\n\n   The AirPort networking technology enables two or more\nAirPort-equipped computers to share files and Internet connections\nvia radio waves at distances of up to 150 feet, even through walls\nand ceilings, at speeds of up to 11 megabits per second. That is\nfaster and easier than any wire-based networking scheme I've tried\nat home, including prototypes of a 10 mbps system, the Home\nPhoneline Networking Association version 2.0 kit for PCs.\n\n   Two Macs, each with an AirPort card, can swap files and share\nsystem resources and can be used for multiplayer games. With the\nbase station, up to 10 (or maybe more) Macs equipped wth AirPort\ncan share a high-speed Internet connection.\n\n   That is so important, and it has such potential to change the\nway we use computers and information appliances around the house,\nthat I'm compelled to repeat it in a different way: I'm sitting\noutside the house on the deck, with an iBook on my lap, enjoying a\nglorious autumn day, reading the current e-news, checking e-mail,\ndoing a little bit of holiday e-shopping, and writing this column.\n\n   There are no wires, cables or extension cords in sight. As the\nstars come out, I simply stroll back into the house and continue\nworking from the sofa in the living room.\n\n   Now I know how my dog must feel. I'm not supposed to be on the\nsofa, at least not with a computer. Computers have been banned from\nthe living room, mainly for esthetic reasons. But with no wires and\npower cords, and an easily carried iBook, no one will know.\n\n   Along with the health and happiness of my family, a championship\nfor the Yankees and my Digital Subscriber Line high-speed Internet\nservice, AirPort is at the top of my list of things to be grateful\nfor this Thanksgiving.\n\n   The iBook itself is a bit of a puzzle, however. How odd it is to\nfinally receive intelligent radio transmissions from Out There,\nonly to discover that they emanate from a device that vaguely\nresembles an orange or blue toilet seat.\n\n   Technically, the iBook is a clamshell design of translucent,\nice-colored plastic with rubberized hot tangerine or cool blueberry\naccents. Apple designed it for students and for consumers buying\ntheir first portable PC.\n\n   The iBook has many clever features, including an extraordinary\nsix-hour battery, a powerful PowerPC G3 microprocessor, a rugged\ncase with a flip-up handle, a plush, full-size keyboard with\ncomfortable wrist wrests, and the AirPort radio antenna embedded in\nthe translucent plastic surrounding a big, bright, colorful display\nscreen. At $1,599, the price measures up admirably against other\nlaptops in its class.\n\n   It also has some turkey features, however, including a base\nconfiguration that offers just 32 megabytes of RAM and a 3.2\ngigabyte hard disk. Apple says the iBook weighs 6.6 pounds, which\nmay be true on Mars. Here on Earth, my scale said it was 8 pounds.\n\n   The stingy helping of RAM means that only one or two application\nprograms can be active at once, and that the processor will be\nhobbled by frequent hard disk access. But Apple wanted to keep the\niBook's price down, and it chose to spend its money on things that\ncannot be upgraded easily, like the Thin Film Transistor screen,\nthe keyboard and the AirPort system.\n\n   Because of the AirPort system, I have been carrying the hefty\niBook everywhere I go in the house. Upstairs, downstairs, in the\nkitchen, in the living room, on the deck, in the garage _\neverywhere I went, the iBook stayed in touch with its DSL-connected\nbase station or, in computer-to-computer mode, to another\nAirPort-equipped iMac in my office.\n\n   nn\n\n   AirPort is based on a new wireless networking protocol called\nIEEE 802.11b, which has been adopted widely within the computer\nindustry. This week, in fact, Dell introduced a line of 802.11,\nwireless networking products for its corporate computers. Apple,\nhowever, is the first to bring 802.11b to the consumer world, at\ndown-to-earth prices.\n\n   In theory, Windows-based machines that adhere to the 802.11b\nstandard will eventually be able to network wirelessly with Macs.\nFor now, however, AirPort wireless home networking is a luxury for\nMac owners only, and then only for Macs that have antennas and can\naccept the AirPort wireless networking card.\n\n   Those include all of the iBooks, all of the newest iMacs (but\nnot the original ones) and all of the desktop G4 Macintoshes except\nthe bottom-end 350-megahertz model.\n\n   Apple says current PowerBook portables, the larger and more\npowerful siblings of the iBooks, and older G3 Macintoshes can be\nadded to an Airport network with an optional WaveLAN network card\nfrom Lucent, which co-developed the AirPort system with Apple. The\ncards cost $179 or $199, depending on features (www.wavelan.com).\nLucent says the cards can also add Windows-based PCs to an AirPort\nnetwork, but I did not test that claim.\n\n   Older Macs, including the recent G3 Blue and White desktops, are\nessentially out of luck. They can be hard-wired, via Ethernet\ncable, to an AirPort base station.\n\n   The AirPort base station resembles a silver flying saucer from a\n1950s science fiction movie. It is stylish enough to leave on the\ndesktop. The base station contains both a 56K modem and a 10BaseT\nEthernet port for connection to a high-speed local area network,\nDSL or cable modem. The real value of the base station is in\nsharing a fast Internet connection.\n\n   Cable and DSL connections are always ``on,'' so connections from\na remote AirPort-equipped computer are instant. If the Internet\nconnection is by dial-up modem, connecting from a remote computer\nworks just as it does from a wired computer. Clicking on the\nbrowser or e-mail software tells the base station to dial into the\nInternet service provider.\n\n   AirPort works only with ISPs that adhere to common Internet\nprotocols, which includes just about all of them except America\nOnline. So, if you connect to the Internet through AOL's dial-up\nsystem, you will need another ISP for the AirPort Internet\nconnection. Once connected to the Internet through AirPort, it is\neasy to log onto AOL and use all its resources, including e-mail.\n\n   Wireless networking is going to be profoundly important, and I\nhope other PC makers follow Apple's bold lead in making 802.11\nconnections a standard feature. Another wireless standard called\nBluetooth will show up in products next year to allow small\nappliances, phones, computer peripherals and consumer electronics\ndevices to communicate automatically. We will soon be bombarding\nthe universe with more radio and infrared emissions than ever\nbefore.\n\n   It seems appropriate, then, that another profound application\nmaking its debut this year involves radio waves arriving from the\nother direction.\n\n   More than 1.4 million Internet-connected personal computer\nowners in 224 countries have teamed up to donate their otherwise\nunused computing cycles to help create the world's largest ad hoc\nsupercomputer. The common goal is to help the SETI(AT)home Project\nat the University of California at Berkeley\n(www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) search for extraterrestrial\nintelligence.\n\n   Since the project began in May, these PCs have collectively\ncontributed 120,000 years' worth of computing time to analyze radio\nemissions from outer space, said Dr. Dan Werthimer, the project's\nchief scientist.\n\n   They have not bagged any aliens yet, Werthimer noted.\n","Headline":"\nNOT BORN TO BE WIRED \n","Text":["\n   When Apple introduced the iBook several months ago as the\nportable version of its popular iMac desktop computer, one of its\nmore intriguing features was a built-in radio antenna that in\ntheory enabled the iBook to connect to the Internet and share files\nwith other Macintosh computers without wires.\n","\n   But like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project,\nwhich scans radio emissions coming from deep space for patterns\nthat might indicate alien intelligence, and perhaps even explain\nthe Pokemon phenomenon, the antenna in my iBook picked up only\nstatic.\n","\n   Apple finally released the missing components last week to allow\nthe iBook to communicate with other silicon-based life forms: the\n$299 AirPort base station and the $99 AirPort wireless networking\ncard.
