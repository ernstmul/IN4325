By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The 33-year-old reporter in Kentucky who was fired on Monday\nafter revealing that she had lied in her newspaper columns about\nhaving cancer to cover up the real diagnosis, AIDS, now says that\nshe has never been treated for AIDS, either.\n\n   In an interview with the reporter, Kim Stacy, published Friday\nin the newspaper that fired her, The Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer,\nMs. Stacy said that all her illnesses had been fabricated, but that\nshe believed she had been suffering from symptoms compatible with\nAIDS.\n\n   Ms. Stacy's first fabrication took place in 1995, when she told\nher co-workers at The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky.,\nthat she had stomach cancer. Her picture was later featured in an\narticle in that newspaper about cancer survivors.\n\n   ``I don't know where the idea came from,'' Ms. Stacy said in\nFriday's article in The Messenger-Inquirer. ``At the time I was\nhaving trouble with my blood sugar and going to the doctor a lot,\nand everybody was real nice to me, real concerned. It seemed like\nthey made an effort to be friends with me.''\n\n   When Ms. Stacy arrived at The Messenger-Inquirer in 1998, she\ntold her editors that she no longer suffered from stomach cancer;\nshe told them she had brain cancer.\n\n   Her columns on cancer, one of which was distributed by The\nAssociated Press in Kentucky, were richly detailed. In one, she\ndescribed the thrill of hearing about a new kind of laser surgery\nthat would remove her brain tumor. In another, she described how\nshe had befriended an 8-year-old leukemia patient who later died.\n``He had been battling a rare form of leukemia for three years and\nhad just finished his latest round of treatments,'' she wrote. ``He\nknew every detail of his illness and, unlike me, was not afraid to\ntalk about it.''\n\n   Ms. Stacy told her editors early this week that she was not\nsuffering from brain cancer, but believed she had AIDS, and chose\nnot to reveal it because of the stigma associated with the disease.\n\n   The only signs of illness Ms. Stacy has right now, she says, are\nan upset stomach and a rash, which she attributes to stress. Her\nfather, Monroe Stacy, said in Friday's Messenger-Inquirer that she\nis a diabetic.\n\n   Robert Ashley, the editor of The Messenger-Inquirer, said:\n``Tragic and embarrassing are two words I would use to describe\nthis situation. It was embarrassing to have to acknowledge that we\npublished false newspaper columns. But we've debriefed and gone\naround a dozen times, and I don't think, looking back over it, that\nwe could have avoided it. This is clearly a person who is quite\ntroubled.''\n\n   Ashley said that Ms. Stacy had submitted to an AIDS test and\nthat he was ``highly skeptical'' that the test would result in a\npositive diagnosis.\n\n   In a column published early this month about her supposed\ncancer, Ms. Stacy wrote: ``I'm not so foolish as to deny it or\npretend my illness doesn't exist. But I also know that the\nimpossible can happen. That is the power of hope. I choose to live\nwith hope.''\n\n   Ashley said, ``I hope she can find a job somewhere.''\n","Headline":"\nFIRED REPORTER ADMITS SHE LIED ABOUT AIDS, TOO  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   The 33-year-old reporter in Kentucky who was fired on Monday\nafter revealing that she had lied in her newspaper columns about\nhaving cancer to cover up the real diagnosis, AIDS, now says that\nshe has never been treated for AIDS, either.\n","\n   In an interview with the reporter, Kim Stacy, published Friday\nin the newspaper that fired her, The Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer,\nMs. Stacy said that all her illnesses had been fabricated, but that\nshe believed she had been suffering from symptoms compatible with\nAIDS.\n","\n   Ms. Stacy's first fabrication took place in 1995, when she told\nher co-workers at The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky.,\nthat she had stomach cancer.
