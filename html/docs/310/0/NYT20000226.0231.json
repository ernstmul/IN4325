Cops are no longer\npermitted to remove narcotics, guns or money from evidence lockers,\nsaid Lt. Sharyn Buck, a spokeswoman for the department.\n\n   ``We now only let them take photographs of the evidence,'' Buck\nsaid.\n\n   Before the changes were made, LAPD officials like those in many\nother police jurisdictions allowed all materials to be signed in\nand out through a flawed ``honor system,'' according to sworn\nstatements by Perez and investigators interviewed by the Daily\nNews.\n\n   ``I could have been anybody,'' Perez recalled in his first\ninterview with investigators last September. ``I could have sent a\ncivilian person in there. ... They don't check I.D. Anybody can\nwalk in there.''\n\n   ``I can get a halfway respectable-looking person, put a badge\naround his neck and tell him to go check it out. And they're gonna\ngive it to him.''\n\n   A high-ranking source close to the widening LAPD corruption\nprobe said preliminary reviews of the department's former\nchain-of-custody procedures confirm Perez's bluster.\n\n   ``It was on the honor system,'' the source said. ``It was for\nthe convenience of the officers going to court.''\n\n   Perez, who agreed to become an informant in exchange for a\nlighter sentence for stealing the cocaine, was sentenced Friday to\nfive years in prison for the March 1998 heist, in which he scammed\nthe department out of eight pounds of cocaine.\n\n   After being credited with time in custody, he is likely to be\nreleased within 10 to 16 months.\n\n   Perez has told investigators he began stealing dope from the\nRampart Division evidence room in December 1997.\n\n   At the time, a ``courier system'' allowed cops to sign out drugs\nand other cataloged evidence for use in court cases. Following the\nproceedings, the officer returned the materials to the evidence\nroom and received a receipt.\n\n   For the most part, the narcotics which had been tested when\ninitially booked as evidence were not retested after officers came\nback from court, sources said.\n\n   Perez tended to request cocaine that was scheduled to be\ndestroyed in the near future because department policy only\nrequired random samplings of drugs prior to their destruction, said\nan investigator who asked not to be named.\n\n   In addition, Perez reduced the likelihood that anyone would pick\nup on his thefts by writing other cops' names on the evidence room\nsign-out sheet and wearing a low-budget disguise, official\ndocuments reveal.\n\n   He told investigators his typical getup featured ``Coke bottle\nglasses,'' a ``really big jacket'' and a baseball cap pulled\ntightly over his head.\n\n   During the March 2, 1998, theft, Perez even left his badge at\nhome, using only the badge holder to gain entrance into the\nevidence room, confidential transcripts obtained by the Daily News\nshow.\n\n   After getting dressed up, Perez said, he would sign out the\ndrugs, stash the dope at a remote location, and then stuff the\nevidence containers with flour and return them to be destroyed.\n\n   The clerks in charge of the evidence room never checked to see\nwhether the drugs were needed in court. Shortly after Perez's scam\nwas discovered in mid-March 1998, bags of flour were found in the\nevidence room, sources said.\n\n   Upon hearing the details of Perez's scheme, Deputy District\nAttorney Richard Rosenthal made an unusual observation during an\ninterview session with the ex-cop last December.\n\n   ``I don't necessarily want to say brilliant,'' Rosenthal said,\n``but (this) was an excellent idea, if you're going to do something\nlike that.''\n\n   Perez, however, was not by any measure a master thief.\n\n   During his first few thefts, Perez said he meticulously weighed\nthe flour and cocaine to avoid detection, then grew impatient and\n``sort of just guess-timated.''\n\n   Perez also refused to settle for just any cocaine and sought out\nthe best dope being held in the evidence room.\n\n   ``It was dope that I was either familiar with or had some\ninvolvement with,'' he told investigators. ``And I knew that it was\ngoing to be righteous dope.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)\n\n   Believing he would never get caught, Perez said, he failed to\nswitch the drugs with flour twice. ``I said there's no way they\nwould ever find out,'' he testified. ``I mean, if you really think\nabout it ... who would have ever known?''\n\n   On one occasion, Perez admitted, he got a bit spooked, and\nburned the container he stole from the evidence room, making it\nimpossible to replace the cocaine with flour.
