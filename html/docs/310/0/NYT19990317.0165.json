They're part of my team, and I feel good, because if I'm\npraying and doing what I need to do and other people are praying\nfor me, I can't lose.''\n\n   The WNBA's Web site link to Perrot had to be discontinued when\nit was overwhelmed by more than 5,000 e-mail messages. Other\nelectronic mail has been forwarded to Perrot from local TV and\nradio stations and the Chronicle.\n\n   A book-size print-out of the electronic messages is being\ncompiled for Perrot by Megan Bonifas, Comets manager of media\nservices.\n\n   ``I was shocked and saddened at the news of your illness,'' a\nman e-mailed from Oakland, Calif. ``But I was encouraged by your\nattitude and determination.''\n\n   ``Everyone I know is talking about what a fighter you are,''\nwrote a Houston fan. ``No one expected you to become starting point\nguard for the Comets. Take that fiery determination and hustle and\nfocus all that energy and talent on this new fight.''\n\n   Banners and cards have also arrived from radio stations, Texas\nChildren's Cancer Center Families and Special Olympics. Many who\nwrote wanted to share their own experiences about battling disease.\n\n   Perrot, 32, had surgery Feb. 24 to remove a golf ball-size brain\ntumor. She now is undergoing 2{ weeks of radiation treatment for\nsmaller tumors and soon will start six months of chemotherapy for\nlung cancer.\n\n   Dr. Ritsuko Komaki, who is overseeing the treatments, said\nPerrot's excellent health improves her chances and she is\n``confident'' the remaining tumors can be eliminated.\n\n   While Perrot's doctors are optimistic, hospital spokeswoman Jane\nBrust said the treatment is ``a process, and they're cautious about\nlong-term results or giving a long-term score card. It will be a\nwhile before there's a real clear picture of how she's doing.''\n\n   But Perrot isn't approaching her recovery in quiet seclusion.\nShe has quickly resumed her public life, which now has an even\nlarger stage.\n\n   On Sunday night she attended gospel singer Kirk Franklin's\nCompaq Center concert, where 10,000 fans joined in prayerful\nsupport.\n\n   On Thursday, Perrot also resumed her motivational speaking\nappearances at area schools. In the basketball offseason, she talks\nto students about fitness, education, diligence and saying no to\ndrugs.\n\n   Her illness won't change that message, she said.\n\n   ``My life has a plan, and this is just another chapter,'' Perrot\nsaid. ``It all revolves around the same thing _ the struggles I've\nhad _ and how throughout those struggles I've always won the\nbattle.\n\n   ``This is another battle. It's just a bigger battle. I will\nstill tell my story.''\n\n   Meanwhile, she is reading up to 50 cards and letters each night\nand plans to read ``every single one of them, word for word.''\n\n   ``If someone took time to write me, to send their blessings and\nprayers, it's more than fair for me to read what they sent.''\n\n   Perrot hopes to find a way to respond to each person, perhaps\nwith help from the Comets media staff.\n\n   ``If it's possible, we'll send every single person a thank-you\nnote,'' she said. ``I can't individually write everyone, but I do\nwant them to know that I received their letter and read it and am\nthankful for it.''\n\n   Fellow cancer sufferers Darryl Strawberry of the New York\nYankees and Eric Davis of the St. Louis Cardinals also have called\nto offer support, as did comedian Bill Cosby, representatives of\nthe Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and WNBA president Val\nAckerman. And she's received flowers from the Rockets' Charles\nBarkley and the Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller.\n\n   Perrot doesn't distinguish between celebrity supporters and\neveryday fans.\n\n   ``Every prayer, every letter, means the same in my heart,'' she\nsaid. ``I've had celebrities call _ people I didn't know, had only\nseen on TV _ but I've also been touched by all the people who wrote\nto share their story about a family member or a friend.\n\n   ``No one means more than the other. All of this means a lot to\nme.''\n\n   Perrot did give special thanks to the Comets and Rockets\norganizations for their support.\n\n   ``Becoming a Comet _ that right there changed my life.''\n\n   She has already resumed light workouts at Westside Tennis\nCenter, where the Comets and Rockets practice.\n\n   ``I'm not 100 percent where I'd be if I didn't need surgery, but\nI'm doing the right things, taking it slowly and doing what my body\nallows me to do.\n\n   ``My training isn't as intense as it would be, but that's OK.\nI've got to start somewhere.''\n\n   Perrot hasn't circled her calendar for the Comets' training camp\nin mid-May, ``because a year ago I wouldn't have circled it,\neither,'' she said. ``I'm just living like I would normally.''\n\n   At 5-feet-5 and without being a draft pick, Perrot was a\nlong-shot to make the team. But she persevered and quickly evolved\ninto the Comets' quarterback and emotional leader on the floor\nthrough two championship seasons.\n\n   While this tenacity reflects a positive outlook Perrot has\nnurtured since long before her illness, the ordeal has sparked an\neven better attitude, she said.\n\n   ``Today I was walking my dog, and I picked up a flower just to\nappreciate it,'' she said.\n\n   ``I've always been a positive person, but not to the point where\none flower, one breath, meant so much. I took the little things for\ngranted. Now I appreciate nature and just breathing because I'm\nfighting for my life.''\n\n   She feels the huge outpouring of support has boosted that\nbattle.\n\n   ``I see us all as a team,'' Perrot said. ``I play for the\nComets, a two-time champion, and now I have a worldwide team.\n\n   ``These cards and letters have given me strength.
