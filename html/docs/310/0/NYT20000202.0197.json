Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, Helen Fisher was exiting the subway at\n34th Street and Broadway when someone grabbed the cell phone out of\nher hand and ran. ``I was holding it till I could put it back into\nmy pocketbook,'' she said.\n\n   When Fisher, the chief executive of Netlink, a\ntelecommunications company, told her friends what had happened,\nmany related similar experiences. ``One friend had his ripped off\nfrom the seat next to him at Yankee Stadium,'' Fisher said.

If you took your phone out of your home market back then,\nyou paid a roaming surcharge of $1.50 for every minute you used\nthat phone. Now there are one-rate plans for 10 cents a minute. So,\nyeah _ if you measure the drop in cell phone fraud in dollars\ninstead of minutes, it looks like fraud losses have dropped 90\npercent.''\n\n   Thieves usually deliver stolen phones to a fence, Wilkinson\nsaid. ``When cloning was prevalent in the early '90s, thieves might\nhave gotten $25 per phone,'' he said. ``Now they get maybe $5 a\nphone.''\n\n   Criminals illegally ship phones to countries like Colombia,\nMexico and Russia when the phones cannot be activated in this\ncountry, Wilkinson said. ``There's often a wireless service\nprovider there that will activate the phone,'' he added.\n\n   A street thief, like the one who stole Fisher's phone, Wilkinson\nsaid, might be able to use a cellular phone for an hour or two\nbefore the victim remembers to call the carrier and shut down the\nphone. ``You may not think it makes sense to steal a phone for a\nfew hours of use,'' he said, ``but the reality is, if the phone has\ninternational dialing capabilities, those few hours might get a\nthief $50 if he sells it.''\n\n   To combat cell phone fraud, carriers now have the ability to\nblacklist stolen phone numbers as soon as the theft is reported,\nsharing the information with cellular businesses across the\ncountry. ``To the extent that carriers participate in it, the\nindustry maintains a database and reports phones that have been\nstolen,'' said DeMaria, at AT&T Wireless Services.
