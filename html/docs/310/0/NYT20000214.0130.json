{"DocumentId":"NYT20000214.0130","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"0","Body":" BC-HEALTH-KIDNEY-KANSAS-KAN \nLIFE WITH ONE KIDNEY \n\n   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By ERICKA MELLON  \n c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  \n\n   For Karee White, standing up to turn off the television before\nbed one night was the beginning of months of fear.\n\n   The Lee's Summit, Mo., resident felt nausea and chest pain so\nintense she thought she was having a heart attack. Much to her\nrelief, doctors at the hospital told her it was only a stress\nattack.\n\n   Two months later, White felt the same pain. Thinking it was\nanother stress attack, she just stayed home this time. But the pain\ncontinued into the next day.\n\n   After friends speculated she might have gallbladder problems,\nWhite called the doctor and set up an ultrasound. Her friends were\npartly right. White did need her gallbladder removed.\n\n   She also needed her kidney removed.\n\n   Doctors had discovered a malignant tumor on her kidney.\n\n   Last week film director Steven Spielberg also had a kidney\nremoved. Though his doctors would say only that they discovered an\n``irregularity'' on the kidney, other doctors have speculated that\nthe most likely reason for Spielberg's kidney removal, also called\na nephrectomy, was a mass on the organ. Masses, often cancerous,\nare the most common cause for removal, doctors say.\n\n   ``Most of the time a kidney is removed because they find a spot\non the kidney or an abnormal mass on a kidney X-ray,'' said Kirk\nDuncan, a Kansas City area nephrologist. ``The concern is that it\ncould possibly represent a tumor or a malignancy.''\n\n   Kidneys also can be removed due to serious infections, abscesses\nor accidents that damage the kidney, doctors say. When both kidneys\nstop functioning, dialysis or transplantation usually is needed.\n\n   Although the kidney is needed to clear the body of waste, people\ncan live normally with less than one kidney. The remaining kidney\nusually enlarges and picks up much of the work load. Typically, the\nremaining kidney works hard enough to achieve about 80 percent of\nthe functioning of two normal kidneys, Duncan said.\n\n   In fact, the body still can function with about one-third of one\nkidney, said J. Brantley Thrasher, chief of urology at the\nUniversity of Kansas Medical Center.\n\n   Doctors do recommend, however, that people who have a kidney\nremoved make a few changes in their lives. Because they don't have\na kidney on reserve, they must be extra careful.\n\n   Many doctors advise that those with only one kidney drink lots\nof fluids to prevent kidney stones, decrease their protein\nconsumption and monitor their blood pressure. They also warn that\ncontact sports can lead to kidney damage and possible need for\nremoval.\n\n   Kidney problems come as a surprise to most people. Noticeable\nsymptoms include blood in the urine, difficulty urinating, more\nfrequent urination _ especially at night _ and pain in the back,\naccording to Teresa Pavia, health information manager for the\nNational Kidney Foundation in New York.\n\n   But many times a kidney problem goes unnoticed. Problems often\nare detected by doctors during a routine physical exam (as was the\ncase with Spielberg) or through an X-ray or other tests done to\nexamine an unrelated concern.\n\n   Of the masses detected on kidneys, about 90 percent are\ncancerous, said Thrasher, a urologic oncologist. Because the\nsymptoms often are unnoticeable he calls kidney cancer ``a silent\nkiller.'' The American Cancer Society estimates that this year\nthere will be 31,200 new kidney and renal pelvis cancer cases\ndiagnosed. And 11,900 people are expected to die of the disease.\n\n   The bad news, Thrasher said, is that the causes of kidney cancer\nare unknown. But some studies have listed family history of cancer\nand exposure to cigarette smoking, cigars and pipes as risk\nfactors. In addition, radiation and chemotherapy don't kill kidney\ncancer, he said. The most effective cure is to remove part or all\nof the kidney.\n\n   ``Surgical therapy early is the best chance for a long-term\ncure,'' Thrasher said. ``Once it spreads outside the kidney, it's\nvery difficult to cure and long-term survival is rare.''\n\n   If the cancer does spread outside the kidney, it spreads to the\nlungs 55 percent to 60 percent of the time, to the bone or\nlymphnodes about 30 percent of the time, and to the brain about 10\npercent of the time, Thrasher said.\n\n   White, who had her kidney removed by Thrasher last November,\nlives daily with the fear the cancer will return. After her\nsurgery, doctors told her they had removed all the cancer, but she\nstill has to go for checkups every six months.\n\n   ``I'm happy that they said they got it all, but there's a big\ndoubt there,'' said the 33-year-old White, personnel manager at a\nLee's Summit Hy-Vee.\n\n   White said she's trying to forget about the surgery, but the\nemotions are hard to escape. She remembers clearly the day the\ndoctor told her she had cancer.\n\n   ``After my first meeting, he told me it was malignant,'' White\nsaid. ``And I said, `That's the good kind?' And he said `No.' So I\nfreaked out. I thought instantaneously I was going to die.''\n\n   White said she became an emotional recluse after learning she\nhad a cancerous tumor. She remembered the pain her parents went\nthrough when her grandmother died of cancer about 13 years ago, and\nshe didn't want them to have to go through that again.\n\n   ``I kept praying,'' she said. ``I just wanted to live. I\nthought, `I'll go through any anguish between now and the surgery\nas long as I can live.' It just wasn't time for me to die. I just\nwanted to let everyone know what they meant to me.''\n\n   Three months after the surgery, White feels healthy physically,\nbut mentally she has changed. She is more careful to tell family\nand friends what they mean to her and she doesn't worry about ``all\nthe stupid little things'' anymore.\n\n   Lolita White (no relation to Karee) was also startled when\ndoctors told her she had cancer. White, of Kansas City, Kan., was\nhaving tests done to examine a hormone problem when doctors found a\nmalignant mass on her kidney.\n\n   ``I was just kind of surprised,'' said White, now 78. ``I never\nthought of myself as having cancer.''\n\n   But White began to research her family medical history and\ndiscovered cancer ran in her family. Knowing she didn't have\nanother choice, White had her kidney removed in January.\n\n   The surgery has made her a little weak, but White said she's\nworking hard in physical therapy to regain her strength. She's\nstaying with her son Marcellus Hughes while she recuperates and has\ntaken up the card game solitaire to keep her busy.\n\n   ``At this age, each day is a blessing,'' she said.\n","Headline":"\nLIFE WITH ONE KIDNEY \n","Text":["\n   For Karee White, standing up to turn off the television before\nbed one night was the beginning of months of fear.\n","\n   The Lee's Summit, Mo., resident felt nausea and chest pain so\nintense she thought she was having a heart attack.
