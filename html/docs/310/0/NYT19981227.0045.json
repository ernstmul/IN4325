Times News Service   \n\n   The promise of a crisp radio signal that can be heard anywhere\nin the nation, considered a futuristic pipe dream a decade ago, now\nappears to be only about a year from reality. Two companies with\ngovernment licenses to bring satellite-delivered digital broadcasts\nto radio _ CD Radio Inc. and XM Satellite Inc. _ have lined up\ntechnology and programming partners and plan to roll out their\nservices in 2000.\n\n   Adopting a business model used by pay services like cable and\nsatellite television, both would-be satellite radio broadcasters\nsay they can build a business from fee-paying listeners who want\nmore than the standard AM or FM fare, or who hate to hear their\nsignal fade when they drive out of range.\n\n   Traditional radio broadcasters, enjoying a record year in\nadvertising revenue, are skeptical that satellite services will\never be serious competition to the free, over-the-air industry.\nThey tend to see audio programming over the Internet as the more\nserious threat.\n\n   But some on Wall Street seem to share the view of the trade\npublication Radio Ink that satellite broadcasters will be ``the\nMarconis of the millennium.'' The investors Sid Bass and Leon\nBlack, for instance, recently paid a total of $300 million for\nseparate stakes in CD Radio, a publicly held company that expects\nto blanket the nation with signals from its three satellites by\nearly 2000, a few months ahead of its privately held rival, XM\nSatellite.\n\n   Both companies say their prime targets will be ethnic audiences,\ncar commuters, long-haul truckers and listeners outside big cities\n_ whom they hope are so dissatisfied with local stations that they\nwill pay $10 or so a month for national services with up to 100\nchannels.\n\n   Listeners will need a satellite-radio adapter that will fit into\na cassette or CD player and a palm-sized antenna that will pick up\nthe signals. The receivers, expected to cost $300 or less, will\ninclude digital displays showing the channel number, the format and\nthe title and performer of each piece of music.\n\n   CD Radio's technology partners include Loral Space\nCommunications and Lucent Technologies, while XM's include the\nHughes Electronics unit of General Motors, STMicroelectronics,\nPioneer Electronic and Sharp. The groups hope eventually to\npersuade automakers to offer satellite receivers as a standard\noption for car-audio systems.\n\n   The satellite players' ambitions are a marked contrast to the\ntechnical conservatism of the conventional radio industry, which\nhas seen few innovations in the decades since the FM band was\nupdated to deliver stereo sound. Broadcasters, who lobbied against\nsatellite radio, are themselves reluctant to pursue digital audio\nbecause of the expense and a perception that consumers are not\ndissatisfied with the status quo.\n\n   But that has not deterred the satellite radio companies from\nproceeding with their plans. To obtain exclusive programs for\nAfrican-Americans, XM went to Black Entertainment Television and\nRadio One Inc., a radio station owner that, like XM Satellite, is\nbased in Washington. And among its other dozens of channels of\nmusic, news and talk, XM expects to broadcast the first national\nHindu and Mandarin Chinese radio programs.\n\n   XM Satellite is owned by American Mobile Satellite Corp., which\nprovides wireless service to business, and World Space Inc., which\nplans to offer satellite radio service outside the United States.\nIn March, XM made a deal to buy two satellites from Hughes and\nexpects to start broadcasting late in 2000.\n\n   CD Radio, public since 1994, has made deals with the Hispanic\nRadio Network, Sports Byline, Bloomberg Radio News and C-Span to\nprovide programming. Half of its 100 channels are to be\ncommercial-free music in formats that include jazz, opera and\nreggae _ niches that would not survive on many local AM or FM\nstations.\n\n   ``We see broad-based appeal,'' said Bruce Leichtman, a media\nresearch director for Yankee Group, a research firm hired by CD\nRadio to study the service's potential market.\n\n   CD Radio, which has tallied $63 million in losses since its\nfounding in 1990, has raised nearly all of the $960 million needed\nfor its start-up costs. Its shares, following the vicissitudes of a\ntechnology start-up company, hit a 52-week high of $44 in May,\ndipped below $15 in October and closed the week's trading last\nThursday at $34.875.\n\n   Next November, the company expects to launch the first of its\nthree satellites, which along with a spare will cost $718 million.\n\n   nn\n\n   An unresolved technical issue is the industry's development of a\nreceiver that can accept either CD Radio's or XM Satellite's\nservice, a requirement stipulated by the Federal Communications\nCommission when it granted the two companies satellite licenses\nlast year.\n\n   ``The odds are for the first generation, we won't get there,''\nsaid David Margolese, chairman and co-founder of CD Radio, which is\nbuilding its studios in Rockefeller Center. ``Whether we hit it or\nnot, it's not that relevant,'' Margolese said, even though failure\nto find a common receiver would require a regulatory waiver.\n\n   CD Radio executives say the company can break even its first\nyear with 1 million subscribers. It is a daunting target for a\nbrand new-service, and one analyst cautioned that to stimulate\ndemand, satellite broadcasters would probably end up subsidizing\nsubscriber equipment, which could cut into potential profits.\n\n   That is close to the situation playing out at DirecTV, a\nsatellite broadcaster owned by GM's Hughes Electronics unit that\nhas about 4.3 million subscribers, and has yet to break even after\nfour years in business. But ``CD Radio doesn't have anywhere near\nthe programming costs'' of DirecTV, Leichtman said.\n\n   CD Radio intends to nearly match what DirecTV spent on\nadvertising in its first year, budgeting $60 million. That\nmarketing may be necessary to help CD Radio distinguish itself from\ncompetitors. A third satellite radio rival has recently emerged:\nWCS Radio Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., consortium that holds\nlicenses for still-to-be-determined wireless services.\n\n   In a hastily arranged FCC auction ordered by Congress in 1997, a\nportion of the radio spectrum initially set aside for digital audio\nservice was redesignated for general purposes, in the expectation\nthat innovative uses would emerge. The 18 winning companies, which\ninclude some of the regional Bell telephone companies, paid a total\nof $13.5 million for the licenses. Now, after spending a year\ntrying to figure out a business plan, the WCS Radio 10-member\nconsortium has sought permission to offer digital audio services\nsimilar to XM's and CD Radio's.\n\n   ``We believe there is tremendous pent-up demand because there is\nan appalling lack of formats,'' said John Mason, WCS' vice\npresident for business development. ``People want more selection.''\n\n   Hugh Panero, XM's chief executive, contends that listeners are\nunderserved by the free programming offered on most ad-supported AM\nand FM stations, which he derided as repetitive and formulaic. He\nblamed deregulation, which has concentrated ownership of the\nnation's stations into fewer hands, intent on using proven\nmoney-making formats. ``Radio is risk averse,'' he said. ``We're\ndedicated to bringing back what radio has lost.''\n\n   The plan calls for most XM channels to carry six minutes of\nadvertising an hour, about half the level heard on most stations.\nRevenue is to be split equally with programming partners.
