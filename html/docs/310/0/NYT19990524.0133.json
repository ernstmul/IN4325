(Clothier, Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution) Art includes one 1-column color illustration\nof a computer.\n\n   DOMAIN-NAMES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The process of registering a\ndomain name, which is simpler than it used to be, is still not as\neffortless as it could be. But soon, it will be a little easier and\nlikely cheaper if a plan to include more registrars and add new\ndomain suffixes is successful. (Gallaga, Austin\nAmerican-Statesman). MOVED.\n\n   TECHNOBUDDY_ I was thinking about pocket calculators the other\nday. I remembered, back in the 1970s, saving up about $400 to buy a\nHewlett Packard calculator. It was an amazing device then. It could\nadd, multiply and divide, as well as do all sort of math problems\nthat would have made my high school trig teacher proud. It was a\nmarvel of the time _ all that power packed into a gizmo small\nenough to fit into my jacket pocket. Nowadays, of course, you can\nfind more powerful pocket calculators for $4 hanging in those\nlittle shrinkwrap packages as you stand in the grocery store\ncheckout line. That's one of the real marvels of technology _ how\nprices drop so fast. Think of any gadget you care to mention _\nmicrowave oven, VCR, color television _ and, if you are old enough,\nyou'll be struck by how expensive it once was and how cheap it is\nnow. While prices for cars, houses and tee shirts have zoomed up\nover the years, gadget prices invariably have dropped. (Husted,\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.\n\n   TECHTOOLS _ We gather today to examine a thing called\nRadioMouse. RadioMouse is not, as you might think, a mouse with an\nAM-FM radio in it, although I'm sure that if one hasn't been\nmarketed it soon will be. Rather, RadioMouse is another wireless\nmouse. It has this small distinction, at least: It's the first\nwireless mouse I've tried. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).\n15. MOVED.\n\n   NETWATCH _ Web sites can help in tracing ancestors.

This week: For people who\nspend most of their working day and some of their personal time\nconnected to the Internet, the Web becomes part of the daily\nroutine. Just as someone who travels a lot in the real world _ the\nplace where it rains and the sun shines _ get to know the\nterritory, those of us who spend half our waking hours in\ncyberspace get to know the territory some. We have sites that are\npart of our practical every day working life. For instance, I check\nthe weather by zapping over to The Weather Channel\n(www.weather.com); or for looking up a street address, e-mail\naddress, or phone number go to Switchboard (www.switchboard.com),\nor to find the best way to get to a business across town use\nYahoo!'s excellent mapping service (maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py).\n(Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 17. MOVED.\n\n   TECH-MEDIA _ If you fear the Y2K bug, this may be the book for\nyou. ``Crisis Investing for the year 2000'' is a guide on how to\nprotect your finances if computers _ especially those on Wall\nStreet _ start to go haywire after midnight on Jan. 1. ``Preparing\nyourself and your investments for Y2K is not the act of a fringe\nsurvivalist,'' say authors L. Jay Kuo and Edward M. Dua in the\npromotion blurb on the jacket of their book. ``Such measures are\nthe practical precautions of an informed realist.'' Here's some of\nthe authors predictions: Y2K will disrupt time-sensitive industries\nsuch as banking and stock trading; Y2K will hurt companies\ndependent on computer automation for making products and companies\ndependent on overseas investments will be hurt because most\ncountries are ill-prepared for the millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution). 14. MOVED.\n\n   MAC-REPORT _ News on Apple and its products. This week: There\nare some areas, dare I say it, in which the PC world commands a\nlead over Apple Computer technology. One of the more significant is\nvoice-recognition software, a technology that Apple Computer once\npioneered. But Apple Computer is starting to close the gap, much to\nthe relief of many Mac users.

But does that mean there's a provable\ncause-and-effect relationship when a young fan goes over the edge?\nThe courts keep saying no. Everything that Eric Harris and Dylan\nKlebold listened to fell under societal scrutiny after they shot to\ndeath 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School in\nLittleton, Colo., and then killed themselves. Caught in the middle\nof the controversy this time was Marilyn Manson. (Riemenschneider,\nAustin American-Statesman). 40.
