At\n6-foot-8 and 250 pounds, the 23-year-old was a lean, muscular\nforward starting a career in the NBA.\n\n   Then, one week before the Kansas City Kings' training camp began\nin 1982, he discovered a tiny lump in his left testicle.\n\n   ''It was about the size of a BB and it didn't hurt,'' said\nDennard, who played on the Duke team that reached the 1978 NCAA\nfinals. ''When I felt it, I knew it wasn't supposed to be there.''\n\n   Athletes have a keen awareness of their bodies, so Dennard\ndidn't hesitate. He consulted with the Kings' trainer, who referred\nhim to a urologist. The urologist told him he should undergo\nsurgery immediately to have the testicle removed.\n\n   Dennard balked before the urologist explained.\n\n   ''He told me that nine times out of 10 it's malignant,'' Dennard\nsaid. ''When you hear that, of course, you go numb.''\n\n   Dennard was stricken with testicular cancer, a disease that is\nstill fairly rare. The American Cancer Society estimates that 7,400\nnew cases will be diagnosed this year. But while it represents only\n1 percent of all male cancers, it's the leading cause of cancer for\nmen in their 20s and 30s.\n\n   Testicular cancer can strike even the healthiest young men.\nFigure skater Scott Hamilton had it, as did professional baseball\nplayer John Kruk. Lance Armstrong, who recently won the Tour de\nFrance, had an advanced case of it. And Green Bay Packers punter\nJosh Bidwell was recently diagnosed with it.\n\n   ''Testicular cancer, for some reason, seems to be on the rise,''\nsaid Dr. Ed Whitesides of Urology Associates of Southeastern North\nCarolina. ''It used to be about three to five per 100,000 men; now\nit's more like eight to 10. No one knows why.''\n\n   Men should conduct self-examinations once a month, say\nurologists and oncologists.\n\n   ''I can't stress how important that is,'' said Dr. Mary Raab, an\noncologist at the East Carolina School of Medicine. ''It's so\nimportant. Women start doing a breast check when they begin\nmenstruating. At the same time, boys should start checking\nthemselves as early as age 13.''\n\n   Dennard, a volunteer for Coaches vs. Cancer, often counsels\nvictims and speaks publicly on battling testicular cancer. He\ncredits early detection with saving his life.\n\n   ''You should not be ashamed of your body,'' he said. ''You have\nto take care of yourself.''\n\n   Dennard had the testicle removed, then went through 20 sessions\nof radiation therapy. The radiation cured him of cancer, although\nit damaged his digestive system.\n\n   Radiation, a common form of treatment that follows surgery, is\nprimarily used to treat cancer that has spread from the testicle to\nlymph nodes.\n\n   Breakthroughs in platinum-based chemotherapy drugs have helped\nincrease the survival rate of men with testicular cancer to 95\npercent, Raab said. The American Cancer Society estimates that 300\npeople in America will die of testicular cancer this year.\n\n   As with radiation, some patients treated with chemotherapy have\nlong-term side effects, such as kidney damage and nerve damage.\n\n   Because he didn't detect his testicular cancer early, pro\ncyclist Armstrong had to endure months of chemotherapy in 1996. The\ncancer spread to his lungs and brain, and he underwent surgery to\nremove a testicle and lesions from his brain. Doctors gave him a 50\npercent chance of survival.\n\n   Armstrong did survive, and he went on to win one of sports' most\ndemanding events last summer. His recovery, like Dennard's,\nillustrates that with treatment, victims of testicular cancer can\ngo on to live normal lives.\n\n   ''He's a man who came from the depths of chemotherapy . . . and\ncame out on top,'' said Karl Hausmann, who heads the Lance\nArmstrong Foundation, which raises money for cancer research.\n\n   Watching the Tour de France ''really brought back some feelings\nof thankfulness,'' Dennard said. ''His recovery was even more\ncourageous because of where his cancer had spread.''\n\n   Dennard also returned to competitive athletics after surgery and\ntreatment. He played 30 games for the Kings during the 1982-83\nseason, then another two years for the Denver Nuggets and in\nEurope.\n\n   Like many men who survive testicular cancer, Dennard started a\nfamily. He now has a 4-year-old son, Mason.\n\n   Chemotherapy can result in a temporary reduction in sperm count,\nRaab said, but in most cases that rate returns to normal. Because\nof the sensitive nature of testicular cancer, many men need\ncounseling in addition to the treatment.\n\n   ''Especially in the younger population, when the cancer often\nstrikes, this is a threat to their manhood or masculinity,'' Raab\nsaid. ''Some of these young men go through a tough time. They feel\nit's almost like they're being castrated.''\n\n   Dennard, who now owns an investor-relations firm in Houston,\nsaid attitudes have changed since the Kansas City Kings' publicly\nannounced that he suffered from ''cancer of the lower intestine''\nrather than reveal where the cancer really was.\n\n   ''More men are sensitive to their feelings than 20 years ago,''\nhe said. ''My counsel is, 'Don't let fear paralyze you,''' he said.\n''It's OK to feel fear _ just don't let it control you.''\n\n     (Scott Irwin writes for the Morning Star in Wilmington, N.C.)   \n   EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Website at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on LifeBeat\nand other features.   \n   -------------------------------------------------  \n\n   --------\n\n   (Nonsubscribers: To publish this ''separate buy'' article, call\nNew York Times Syndicate sales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at\n(732) 390-4480 or fax her at (732) 390-4697.\n","Headline":"\nTOP ATHLETES NOT IMMUNE TO TESTICULAR CANCER\n","Text":["\n   Pro athlete Ken Dennard was the picture of good health.
