Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Faced with questions about whether more than two\ndozen childhood brain cancer patients may have been exposed to the\nviruses that cause AIDS and hepatitis C during a gene therapy\nexperiment, the scientist conducting the study said Friday that the\nchance that any children were actually harmed was ``infinitesimally\nsmall.''\n\n   Dr. Laura C. Bowman, a pediatric oncologist at St. Jude\nChildren's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said that if the\ntherapy the children received was tainted, it was probably\ncontaminated by genetic snippets of virus, not whole virus\nparticles that could cause an infection.\n\n   ``We doubt very much that it was really virus,'' Bowman said.\n``But obviously we are pursuing it.''\n\n   A Food and Drug Administration official said Friday that it may\ntake as long as two weeks for agency laboratories to determine\nwhether the therapy was contaminated.\n\n   Researchers first learned of the possible problem in the fall\nbut did not report it to agency until Feb. 4 and are only now\nnotifying families. In an interview, Bowman said she had been\nwaiting for conclusive evidence about whether the therapy was\ntainted. She said that she did not want to needlessly worry\npatients and that the Institutional Review Board at her hospital\nconcurred with that decision.\n\n   Asked if the researchers' behavior was improper, or in violation\nof federal rules, the agency official said: ``We're in the middle\nof an investigation. We can't say at this point.''\n\n   The inquiry is likely to intensify questions about gene therapy\nresearch, which has been under scrutiny since an 18-year-old\npatient at the University of Pennsylvania died in September. Last\nmonth, the FDA shut down all gene therapy experiments at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.\n\n   The brain cancer experiment took place at St. Jude and Baylor\nCollege of Medicine in Houston. A total of 25 patients were\nenrolled, beginning in 1995. Of these, Bowman said, all but eight\nhave died of their underlying disease, a type of childhood brain\ncancer that is universally fatal.\n\n   The majority of the patients were treated at St. Jude and ranged\nin age from 4 to 17. The FDA has ordered both institutions not to\nenroll any more patients in the experiment.\n\n   In gene therapy, scientists try to use healthy genes to prevent\nor cure a variety of illnesses, from rare inherited disorders to\nheart disease and cancer. The brain cancer experiment involved a\n``tumor vaccine'' that was made by inserting a tumor-suppressing\ngene into a weakened cold virus, adenovirus. This cocktail, called\na vector, was injected under the skin of the arm.\n\n   Bowman said she treated her last patient in March. Last fall,\nshe said, St. Jude began an effort to build ``a very stringent\nquality assurance program.'' As part of that effort, a quality\ncontrol specialist learned that two patients had been given a tumor\nvaccine that was inadvertently manufactured from adenovirus taken\ndirectly from a master batch.\n\n   A subsequent in-house investigation found that neither the St.\nJude laboratory nor the industry laboratory that provided the\nmaster batch had screened it for the viruses that cause AIDS and\nhepatitis C, Bowman said. Such screening is required by the FDA.\nSamples from the batch tested ``weakly positive,'' Bowman said. But\nsuch tests are extremely sensitive and often give ``false\npositive'' results, experts say.\n\n   ``I don't think this is real,'' said Dr. Savio Woo, president of\nthe American Society for Gene Therapy, which represents\nresearchers. ``But of course, we are going to have to wait for the\ntests.''\n","Headline":"\nDOCTOR SAYS HARM TO CHILDREN IS UNLIKELY IN QUESTIONED STUDY \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Faced with questions about whether more than two\ndozen childhood brain cancer patients may have been exposed to the\nviruses that cause AIDS and hepatitis C during a gene therapy\nexperiment, the scientist conducting the study said Friday that the\nchance that any children were actually harmed was ``infinitesimally\nsmall.''\n","\n   Dr. Laura C.
