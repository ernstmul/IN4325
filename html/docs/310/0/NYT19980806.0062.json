Using\nlaparoscopes, physicians can insert a slender tube into the body\nthrough a keyhole incision and direct it to the site of a tumor.

Better ways of administering anesthesia, providing\nintensive care, and boosting nutrition have meant fewer pre- and\npostoperative complications. The bottom line, says cancer surgeon\nKenneth Tanabe of MGH, is that ``surgery is an option for many more\npatients than it was before.

And here more than anywhere, those refinements have\narisen as much from serendipity as from science.\n\n   That's what happened 37 years ago when Barnett Rosenberg, a\nbiophysicist at Michigan State University, made an unusal\nobservation: When an electric current generated by platinum\nelectrodes was run through a solution of E. coli bacteria, the\norganisms continued to grow but stopped dividing. When the\nelectricity was shut off, the bacteria started to divide again.\n\n   ``We thought it was the electricity, because the effects\nfollowed precisely after we turned it on and off,'' recalls\nRosenberg, who now runs his own research institute in Michigan.\n\n   It turned out it was the platinum _ or, more specifically, a\nchemical called cisplatin produced when platinum electrodes leached\ninto the solution _ that turned off the cell division. Rosenberg\nsuspected that if cell division could be arrested in bacteria, it\nalso could be arrested in cancer cells. So he tested cisplatin on\nmice, then on humans with testicular cancer. In 1978 the FDA\napproved its use.\n\n   The results have been breathtaking. Before cisplatin, fewer than\n10 percent of patients with testicular cancer survived for five\nyears; now, more than 90 percent of even advanced cases are cured.\nAnd it can be effective in treating cancer of the lungs, ovaries,\nand head and neck.\n\n   ``Young men were lying in bed dying of testicular cancer, and\nwomen of ovarian. They gave them this new drug and they stood up\nand walked out. You're dead and now you're alive,'' recalls Dr. Lee\nNadler, head of adult oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\n   The lesson, says Dr. Harold Varmus, head of the National\nInstitutes of Health, is that ``pure serendipity is important. It\nillustrates what is meant by incremental progress.''\n\n   Sometimes progress means adding one old-standby drug to another\nthat has been around for years, creating the sorts of potent\n``cocktails'' that have proven so effective in battling the AIDS\nvirus. Combinations of fluorouracil and levamisole gave oncologists\ntheir first real success with cancers of the colon, while cisplatin\nworks even better when mixed with bleomycin and etoposide for\npatients with tumors of the testicles.\n\n   Other advances have come from altering the timing of treatments,\nfirst moving the chemotherapy to just after the operation, then to\njust before.\n\n   ``People think of chemotherapy as conventional, as old hat,''\nsays Dr. Emil Frei, former physician-in-chief at the Dana-Farber\nCancer Institute and a front-line fighter against cancer for 43\nyears. ``But chemo continues to march as the most important\nsystematic approach to cancer cure and treatment.''\n\n   People also think of chemotherapy as bringing with it vomiting,\ndepletion of white blood cells, and other sickening side effects.\nBut many of those problems, too, are becoming more memory than\nreality, as researchers over the last 10 years have developed\nmedicines to control nausea and pump up production of white and red\nblood cells.\n\n   While hair loss still ``is absolutely as prevalent as ever,\nwe've tried to get rid of the most feared side effects,'' says Dr.\nDouglas Faller, director of the Cancer Research Center at Boston\nMedical Center. And while lessening side effects is a major relief\nto patients, it also can give a big boost to their therapy. ``It\ngives us greater ability to deliver these chemotherapy drugs\nwithout interruption,'' explains Dr. Charles Fuchs of Dana-Farber.\n\n   Rebecca McClintock of Francestown, N.H., who has twice had to\ncontend with cancer, says she is living proof of the difference\nthose refinements have made.\n\n   ``This was an absolute walk in the park,'' the 30-year-old says,\ncomparing recent chemo treatments for breast cancer with those she\nreceived for leukemia as a teenager. ``When I think of chemotherapy\n15 years ago, that's what I think of, throwing up.

In this way, Pinedo hopes to shrink\nthe tumor enough to give surgeons a better shot at excising it all\nwhile preserving more of the breast.

Pinedo isn't sure, which\nis why he has begun more extensive trials in Mexico City, where\nearly detection is spotty and women often develop large breast\ntumors before they are diagnosed. Over the next four years he hopes\nto try the technique on at least 300 Mexican women.\n\n   ``My hypothesis,'' explains Pinedo, ``is that if you can\npreserve the lymph nodes longer you may help build up an immune\nresponse to the primary tumor, which would help make the\nchemotherapy work better.''
