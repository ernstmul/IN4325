Treatment has to be quick: The benefits were\nlimited to people who got the drug within three hours.\n\n   The question was whether the good results would hold up over a\nlonger period. The report, from a number of collaborating medical\ncenters, said that the improved outcomes were sustained at six\nmonths and 12 months after the stroke.\n\n     \n   \nDrug halts cause of blindness in mice   \n  \n\n   Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions are expressing\nenthusiasm about a new drug that, in mice, completely halts the\nabnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye that causes diabetic\nretinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, two common\nblinding diseases.\n\n   Scientists have been searching for a way of stopping the growth\nof blood vessels in or beneath the retina, the light-sensitive\nlayer at the back of the eye. The abnormal vessels often leak fluid\nor blood and progressively destroy vision.\n\n   The new drug, made by Novartis Ltd. Pharmaceuticals and labeled\nPKC 412, blocks chemicals that foster angiogenesis, or the growth\nof new blood vessels, said the scientists, headed by Dr. Peter A.\nCampochiaro, a professor of ophthalmology and neuroscience at Johns\nHopkins. The results are published in the June issue of the\nAmerican Journal of Pathology.\n\n   While results in mice do not necessarily predict the\neffectiveness of a treatment in humans, Campochiaro said in a\nstatement, ``This is the first drug I've seen that has a\nknock-your-socks-off kind of effect,'' adding that previously\nstudied drugs were only about 50 percent effective.\n\n   Human trials of the drug could begin next year, he said.\n\n     \n   \nGenetic link found to coronary spasms   \n  \n\n   Coronary spasms _ contractions in blood vessels that can cause\nchest pain or heart attacks _ are more likely to occur in some\npeople than others: for example, they're more common in Japanese\npeople.\n\n   Until now there had been no explanation for this imbalance. This\nweek, Japanese researchers said they have found three gene\nmutations that seem to predispose individuals to coronary spasms.\n\n   Reporting in the journal Circulation, the scientists from\nKumamoto and Kyoto universities said that they found the mutations\nin 30 percent of patients who had coronary spasms, but only in 7\npercent of 161 people without them.\n\n   The mutations affect a gene that helps regulate the production\nof nitric oxide in the blood vessels of the heart, the coronary\narteries. Nitric oxide is an important chemical messenger that\nsignals blood vessels to relax and allow blood to flow more freely.\nThe finding could lead to new drug treatments for people who are\ngenetically predisposed to the spasms, the researchers said.\n\n     \n   \nCancer may initiate disorders of brain   \n  \n\n   People with cancer sometimes suffer from brain and nerve\ndisorders caused when their immune system erroneously attacks the\nbrain while attempting to combat the cancer. The cancer may go\nunnoticed for a long time as the cause of the brain problem.\n\n   Researchers are reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine\nthat testicular tumors are particularly prone to causing a brain\ndisorder that can manifest itself as depression, seizures, and\ndementia.\n\n   The scientists, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,\nsaid they identified antibodies in the blood of 12 patients showing\nthat the immune system was attacking both the tumor and the brain,\nand they say these antibodies could be used to diagnose suspected\ncases of the disorder, called paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.\n","Headline":"\nSTROKE TREATMENT BENEFITS ASSESSED;  \n DRUG HALTS CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN MICE;  \n GENETIC LINK FOUND TO CORONARY SPASMS;  \n CANCER MAY INITIATE DISORDERS OF BRAIN \n","Text":["\n   The benefits for stroke patients of quick treatment with\nclot-busting drugs _ a greater chance of avoiding disability _ last\nfor at least a year afterward, according to a new study.\n","\n   The report in the New England Journal of Medicine is a followup\nto a study published in 1995 showing that stroke patients who\nreceived the drug, tissue plasminogen activator, or t-PA, were at\nleast 30 percent more likely than patients given a placebo to have\nminimal or no disability three months after the stroke.\n","\n   T-PA and similar drugs dissolve clots that obstruct blood\nvessels to the brain.
