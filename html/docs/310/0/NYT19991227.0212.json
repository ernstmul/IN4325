Futurist attempts to establish a foothold in\nacademia largely have failed.\n\n   Three decades after the heyday of celebrated intellectual\nfuturists such as Daniel Bell, Herman Kahn and Buckminster Fuller,\n``there isn't a widely visible person known as a futurist who is\nrespected by a substantial portion of the population,'' said Mike\nMarien, a veteran futurist.\n\n   ``We were on a roll back then, in the 1970s. (We) felt (we) were\npart of something,'' said Marien, the editor of Future Survey,\nwhich is published by the best-known futurist group, the World\nFuture Society of Bethesda, Md.\n\n   But their sense of importance was shaken by repeated failures in\nforecasting technological and social trends, ranging from the\nemergence of the Internet to the end of the Cold War.\n\n   Enthralled by the possibility of fabulous new technologies, few\nfuturists expected the trends that have really shaken society: the\nrapid entry of women into the work force, the worldwide revival of\nnationalism and religious fundamentalism, the return of mass\nepidemics such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the\nemergence of the environmentalist and gay and lesbian movements.\n\n   Futurists have not always been wrong. But rare indeed is the\nlong-term forecast that accurate _ for example, the forecast by\nUnited Nations demographers, around 1960, that the world population\nwould exceed 6 billion by 2000. That is almost exactly the present\nworld population.\n\n   ``There's a lot of futurists who confuse their hopes with\nreality,'' acknowledges a veteran futurist scholar, Don Michael of\nSan Francisco. The futurist movement has suffered from ``a failure\nof leadership, a failure to get it together. (There's been) a far\ntoo passive sense of sitting back and hoping something would\nhappen, instead of making it happen.''\n\n   Another big change in the futurist movement has been the shift\nin what Michael calls the ``locus of utopia.'' A few decades ago\nfuturists tended to assume that whatever happened in the future,\ngovernments would be substantially responsible for it.\n\n   But now, when public confidence in government has fallen, Marien\nsees a shift toward ``the privatization of utopia,'' toward\nvisionary thinking in corporations, for example. This is reflected\nby business literature that emphasizes the corporate potential of\nnew technologies and managerial styles.\n\n   ``The dream of the 20th century was the construction of mass\nutopia. As the century closes, this dream is being left behind,''\nSusan Buck-Morss, a government professor at Cornell University,\nwrites in her book, ``Dreamworld and Catastrophe,'' to be published\nin the spring by MIT Press. ``The larger social vision has given\nway to private dreams of material happiness and to political\ncynicism.''\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
