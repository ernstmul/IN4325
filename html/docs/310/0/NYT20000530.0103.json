Smith had one of the bad breast cancers, the ones that\nrecur and spread and defy even the harshest chemotherapy drugs\nreserved for desperate cases.\n\n   A year ago, after the disease spread to her neck, ``the doctor\nsaid I had three to five years,'' said Smith, a 38-year-old mother\nof three who lives near Indianapolis. ``I told her I needed another\n15 or 20 years, so she better find a way to get rid of it.''\n\n   Last June, Smith, who is a registered nurse, entered a clinical\ntrial of anti-VEGF, one of the new cancer drugs known as\nangiogenesis inhibitors that are supposed to strangle tumors' blood\nsupply lifelines and cause fewer punishing side effects than\ntraditional chemotherapy.\n\n   Now, she says, the cancer in her neck is undetectable, and she\nhas suffered minimal side effects from the treatment.\n\n   ``It's wonderful,'' said Smith, whose religious faith earned her\nthe nickname ``Miracle Child'' among the staff, adding, ``I`m so\nblessed.''\n\n   Smith is among five of 59 patients with advanced breast cancer\nwhose tumors have responded to the drug, made by Genentech Inc., in\ntoxicity testing, according to a sobering report at last week's\nmeeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology. And no one\nknows whether the drug will continue to keep her tumor in check.\n\n   Still, hopeful anecdotes such as Smith's are beginning to emerge\nfrom early testing of some angiogenesis inhibitors, which many\nspecialists (and patients) believe is the most exciting front in\nthe war against cancer. Perhaps $4 billion has been spent in\nresearch on this new class of cancer treatments, and about 6,500\ncancer patients have received some sort of therapy, according to\nthe Boston-based Angiogenesis Foundation.\n\n   Of course, it's far too soon to write an overall report card on\nthe drugs, dozens of which are now undergoing human trials. And\nmany of the trials are still in Phase I, in which the drugs are\npitted against out-of-control cancers in very sick patients,\ncreating a formidable challenge for any new drug.\n\n   ``I would say we have some good leads. We have some drugs that\nare clearly not producing side effects in patients,'' said David\nCheresh, an angiogenesis researcher at the Scripps Clinic and\nResearch Foundation in California.\n\n   Moreoever, he said, cancers are being slowed or halted in some\npatients, ``and I see that as a remarkable success in drugs that\nhave no side effects. If we can simply hold tumors at bay, we've\naccomplished a major, major goal,'' Cheresh said.\n\n   Researchers say that some terminally ill patients who received\nanti-angiogenesis drugs are still alive between one and two years\nlater, when they otherwise would have died long ago.\n\n   However, the drugs haven't even slowed some types of cancer. For\nexample, when the drug thalidomide, a sedative that has some\nanti-angiogenic traits) was given to 17 patients with metastatic\nhead and neck cancer, one patient soon died and the tumors\ncontinued to grow in the other 16.\n\n   In addition, the drugs have caused serious, even lethal, side\neffects in other patients. Most alarming, in a trial of 99 patients\nwith advanced lung cancer given the same anti-VEGF drug taken by\nSmith, six patients suddenly began coughing up blood and four died.\nThe drug also apparently caused strokes in a few patients with\ncolon cancer.\n\n   The angiogenesis field, pioneered by Dr. Judah Folkman at\nHarvard Medical School and Children's Hospital in Boston, has been\nawash in high expectations since some of the drugs have obliterated\nhuge tumors in animals at little cost in side effects.\n\n   Hopes have been particularly high for endostatin, discovered in\nFolkman's lab, because it proved so powerful and nontoxic in animal\nexperiments. But a senior official at the National Cancer\nInstitute, which is overseeing two endostatin trials, recently said\nhe has seen no dramatic benefits from endostatin after seven months\nof testing.\n\n   Folkman countered at last week's conference in New Orleans that\nhe was ``very pleased'' by the initial tests _ which show the drug\nseems free of toxicity _ and suggested it is too early to judge\nendostatin's effects on cancer.\n\n   But, while researchers spar publicly over extremely preliminary\nresults on endostatin, other angiogenesis inhibitors such as\nanti-VEGF and a few others provide a better reality check, since\nthey are well into the second phase of the three-stage human\ntesting process. However, these drugs are less potent than\nendostatin is in animals.\n\n   In contrast to Phase I studies, which concentrate on safety, in\nPhase II, researchers look for signs that the drug works.\n\n   Dr. William Li, who heads the Angiogenesis Foundation that\npromotes research and application of the drugs, said that this\nyear's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting was the first\nto have a large number of reports from human trials of angiogenesis\ninhibitors.\n\n   While encouraged by some of the results, Li noted that ``many\npeople have believed that all solid tumors are dependent on\nangiogenesis (recruiting a new blood supply) and therefore that\nthey would all respond'' to inhibitors. ``However, in human\nclinical studies we've generally not seen the consistent\nspectacular results that we've seen in mice,'' he added.\n\n   The idea behind these drugs is elegantly simple. Instead of\ntrying to pulverize cancer cells, the way standard chemotherapy and\nradiation do, angiogenesis inhibitors aim to shut off tumors' blood\nsupply. If tumors can't attract new blood vessels to fuel them,\nthey can't grow or spread.\n\n   Of course, angiogenesis _ the formation of new blood vessels _\nisn't always harmful. The body needs to turn on blood vessel growth\nto repair wounds and to form the blood-rich lining of the uterus\nduring menstruation and pregnancy.\n\n   The antiangiogenic drugs work by blocking the many chemical\nsignals that tumors send out to nearby blood vessels, which may\nrespond by sending out tiny blood vessels that grow toward the\ntumor. Tumor cells attacked by conventional chemotherapy drugs\neventually mutate into resistant cells, thwarting the treatment.\nAngiogenesis blockers don't have the problem because they bypass\ntumors and focus just on the blood vessels.\n\n   Angiogenesis inhibitors may not kill tumors, but there are good\nreasons to think they could hold cancer in check for years _ as\nlong as they are free of side-effects. Natural anti-angiogenesis\nsubstances in the body, such as endostatin, probably keep many tiny\ntumors from ever becoming troublesome, Folkman believes.\n\n   The New Orleans meeting included reports on other new\n``targeted'' therapies, drugs designed to attack weak points in\ncancer cells by focusing on specific molecules. Some of those are\nshowing similar encouraging progress.\n\n   As for anti-angiogenesis drugs, there were about 40 reports\nincluding:\n\n   _ Genentech's anti-VEGF, combined with a standard chemotherapy\ndrug, stalled the disease in advanced colon cancer patients and\nextended survival to an average of at least 17 months, compared to\n13.8 months in those who got only the chemo. Side effects included\nstrokes, high blood pressure, fever and chills.\n\n   _ In 99 patients with the most common form of lung cancer,\nanti-VEGF along with chemo slowed the disease enough to add a few\nmonths of survival. ``That may not seem like a long time, but it's\nas big an improvement as we've ever seen,'' said Dr. Russell DeVore\nof Vanderbilt University.\n\n   However, the lung bleeding that killed four patients was a total\nsurprise, DeVore said, noting that they all occurred among patients\nwith a specific type of the disease, squamous cell lung cancer. One\npossible explanation advanced by other researchers is that the\nanti-VEGF drug destroyed weakened blood vessels in and around the\ntumor that had been supporting lung tissue.\n\n   _ Thalidomide, the once-banned sedative that caused tragic birth\ndefects, yielded ``stunning'' results in treating multiple myeloma,\na form of bone marrow cancer, reported Dr. Bart Barlogie of the\nArkansas Cancer Research Center.\n\n   Thalidomide also showed some activity in patients with recurring\nbrain tumors, stabilized disease in inoperable liver cancer.\nHowever, it was ineffective in patients with head and neck cancers\nand in lung cancer.\n\n   _ An antiogenic drug named SU5416, made by Sugen, Inc., combined\nwith standard chemo, showed promise in patients with advanced colon\ncancer, and was tolerated by patients at every dosage level. In 28\npatients the drug shrank just one tumor completely, partially\nshrank tumors in five others, and held the disease in check in 9\npatients. It had no effect in four others.\n\n   Endostatin, made by EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md., is in Phase\nI trials in Boston; Madison, Wisc.; and Houston. At one point, the\nresearchers thought they might report some data at the oncology\nconference, but then said they hadn't analyzed enough results yet.\nDespite unanswered questions about its effectiveness, the company\nplans to go on to Phase II trials.\n\n   Dr. Joanna Horobin, an EntreMed vice president, said last week\nthat a new trial is planned to begin in Europe using portable pumps\nto administer endostatin continuously at low doses, instead of the\nonce-daily infusions patients have been getting thus far.\n\n   Meanwhile, Horobin said researchers are rapidly analyzing ``an\nenormous amount'' of data from the Phase I trials in Boston, being\ncarried out by Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care. The material\nincludes blood and urine samples, biopsy tissues and different\nkinds of imaging scans.\n\n   When all the data is sifted, she said, it will be possible to\ndraw some conclusions about the drug's Phase 1 performance.
