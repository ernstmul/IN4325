Times News Service    \n\n   An experimental treatment for advanced kidney cancer has shrunk\ntumors or wiped them out completely and prolonged life in some\npatients for whom conventional therapy failed, doctors are\nreporting.\n\n   Although the doctors are reporting only the first test of the\nprocedure, and although their findings are considered preliminary,\nresearchers not connected with the work say the results are\nencouraging enough to warrant testing the treatment in more\npatients with kidney cancer or certain other types of tumors.\n\n   There are 30,000 cases of kidney cancer a year in the United\nStates, a third of them attributed to smoking, and 12,000 deaths.\n\n   The new procedure, a modified version of bone-marrow\ntransplantation, was developed at the National Heart, Lung and\nBlood Institute by a team led by Dr. Richard W. Childs. In a paper\nto be published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, he\nand his colleagues describe the first 19 patients they treated,\nfrom one to three years ago.\n\n   Before treatment, few of the 19 patients were expected to live\nmore than a year, Childs said. But nine, all of whom got their\ntreatment more than a year ago, are still alive, including four in\nwhom all traces of the cancer have disappeared. In the five others\nstill alive, tumors have shrunk by more than half.\n\n   Eight patients died of their cancer, and two died of\ncomplications from the treatment. The tumors had shrunk in one of\nthese two patients.\n\n   ``We've taken the worst of the worst kidney-cancer patients, who\nhad no other treatment option available, and cancers regressed in a\nmajority,'' Childs said in a telephone interview. ``We're making\ntumors shrink, and making people live longer.''\n\n   But, he said, it is impossible to tell how long the remissions\nwill last. ``We don't want to use the word `cure' until it's five\nyears,'' he said, adding that cancer patients sometimes relapsed\neven after 10-year remissions.\n\n   All the patients in the study had advanced kidney cancer that\nhad spread to other organs and that had not improved after\nconventional treatment with interleukin-2 or interferon alfa, drugs\nmeant to stimulate the patient's immune system to fight the tumor.\n\n   Those drugs help only about 19 percent of patients. And standard\nchemotherapy with drugs meant to kill tumor cells outright is\nineffective against kidney cancer, in part because the kidneys are\ndesigned to remove harmful substances from the body without being\naffected by them.\n\n   Once kidney cancer has begun to spread, half of patients die in\nless than a year.\n\n   Bone marrow transplantation, in which cells from a donor are\ngiven to a cancer patient, has not previously been used to treat\nkidney cancer. It is most often used to treat leukemia and other\ncancers that affect the blood and the immune system.\n\n   In those diseases, the patient is given huge doses of\nchemotherapy and radiation to kill the cancer. But that treatment\nalso destroys the patient's immune system and blood-forming cells,\nand if they are not reconstituted, the patient will die. So the\ndonor's bone marrow, which contains stem cells that can multiply\nand create a whole new blood supply and immune system, is used to\n``rescue'' the patient from the chemotherapy.\n\n   In the patients with kidney cancer, Childs and his colleagues\nused the donor cells in a radically different way. Rather than\nusing them to rescue the patient from chemotherapy, they reasoned\nthat the donor cells themselves could fight the patient's cancer.\n\n   Since chemotherapy does not fight kidney cancer, the patients in\nthe study were not given big doses of it, or radiation. But they\nwere given drugs to destroy their immune systems, so that their\nbodies would not reject the stem cells that they then received from\ndonors.\n\n   The donors were siblings who had matching cell types; patients\nwhose siblings did not match could not enter the study. The stem\ncells were collected from the donors' bloodstream, with no need for\npainful bone punctures used in the past to harvest stem cells from\nmarrow.\n\n   The greatest risk of the procedure was that the donor cells\nwould attack not just the tumors but also the patient's own\ntissues, in a potentially fatal reaction called graft-versus-host\ndisease. Two patients did die as a result of that disorder.\n\n   The team used immunosuppressive drugs to try to prevent the\ndisorder, but also began withdrawing the drugs as quickly as\npossible in order to allow the donors' marrow to fight the cancer\ncells.\n","Headline":"\nNEW TREATMENT SHRINKS KIDNEY TUMORS \n","Text":["\n   An experimental treatment for advanced kidney cancer has shrunk\ntumors or wiped them out completely and prolonged life in some\npatients for whom conventional therapy failed, doctors are\nreporting.\n","\n   Although the doctors are reporting only the first test of the\nprocedure, and although their findings are considered preliminary,\nresearchers not connected with the work say the results are\nencouraging enough to warrant testing the treatment in more\npatients with kidney cancer or certain other types of tumors.\n","\n   There are 30,000 cases of kidney cancer a year in the United\nStates, a third of them attributed to smoking, and 12,000 deaths.\n","\n   The new procedure, a modified version of bone-marrow\ntransplantation, was developed at the National Heart, Lung and\nBlood Institute by a team led by Dr. Richard W.
