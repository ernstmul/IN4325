Times News Service    \n\n   If a child at the Enrico Fermi School in Yonkers, N.Y., is found\nto have have attention deficit disorder, parents can choose an\nunusual alternative to medication: neurofeedback, a computerized\nbiofeedback system that some say strengthens the brain.\n\n   Linda Vergara, the school's principal, said she was driven to\ntry the approach when doctors diagnosed the disorder in her son in\n1992. ``They told me I needed to give him something to calm him\ndown,'' she said.\n\n   Vergara decided not to give her son Ritalin, the drug frequently\nused to treat the ailment, and instead took him to see Dr. Mary Jo\nSabo, a psychologist in Suffern, N.Y., to try neurofeedback.\n\n   Vergara said she saw her son become calmer, and he began doing\nhis homework without being asked. She and Sabo teamed up to bring\nthe technique to Fermi, a public elementary school with 900\nchildren.\n\n   Now, five years after the program began, nearly 300 children\nhave been treated at no charge with neurofeedback at Fermi and two\nother public schools in Yonkers for a variety of problems,\nincluding ADD, learning disabilities and depression.\n\n   ``There are children who see tremendous gains and some who see\nminimal changes,'' said Vergara. ``Over all the kids can focus\nbetter and have better self-esteem. There are fewer suspensions,\nbetter attendance and fewer late kids.''\n\n   Generally relegated to the fringes by mainstream scientists when\nit was introduced in the 1970s, brain wave biofeedback _ now called\nneurofeedback or neuro-therapy _ has returned. Its effectiveness\nboosted by computers, it has made its way into mainstream health\ncare, largely as a treatment for attention deficit disorder, but\nalso for depression, head injuries, sleep disorders and other\nproblems.\n\n   Critics say that not enough research has been conducted on the\ntechnique to justify any claims for its effectiveness. But that has\nnot stopped parents of children with ADD from seeking it out,\nhoping to avoid or reduce medication for a condition with symptoms\nthat range from an inability to focus to impulsive outbursts.\n\n   One of the hundreds of clinics in the United States offering the\ntreatment is Connecticut Educational Services in Middletown, Conn.,\nwhich specializes in treating ADD, hyperactivity and traumatic\nbrain injury. Dr. Robert Reynolds, the psychologist who operates\nthe clinic, said the technique brought about long-term changes in\nthe brain's functions.\n\n   ``About half the children we treat get off medication\ncompletely,'' Reynolds said. ``The other half reduce their\nmedication.''\n\n   Brain wave training, he said, is part of a package of treatments\nthat includes family counseling and behavioral therapy. But the\nbrain wave training, he said, is key.\n\n   ``We did all these things without the neuro-feedback and they\ndidn't work as well,'' Reynolds said. A testing and treatment\npackage costs around $4,500 at the clinic.\n\n   Critics say that improvements in the patients probably stem from\na placebo response and that parents should be aware that the\ntechnique is highly experimental.\n\n   ``If you give a child four extra hours a week of one-on-one\nattention you'll see some improvement,'' said Dr. Larry Silver, who\nhas been treating attention deficit disorder in the Washington area\nsince 1964. ``But will it last a week or a month later? There has\nbeen no follow-up.''\n\n   The disorder, Silver said, is ``a neurochemical deficiency.'' He\nadded: ``And the only thing that will raise the levels of\nneurochemicals is medication. We've found no alternatives.''\n\n   Most neurofeedback systems use one or two dime-size sensors\nplaced on the scalp. The sensors read the subtle electrical\nfrequencies of the brain. The signal is amplified and displayed on\na computer, and a clinician can see where the client needs to alter\nthe range of frequencies.\n\n   The patients sit at the computer and play Pacman or another\nvideo game. Their success at the game is tied to their ability to\nexpand the range of their brain waves. After 20 to 40 sessions the\nbrain changes are set in place, practitioners say.\n\n   ``It's brain exercise,'' said Dr. Alan Strohmeyer, chief of the\nBiofeedback Section of the Department of Neurology at North Shore\nUniversity Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and an assistant professor\nof neuroscience and neurology at the New York University School of\nMedicine. ``There's a direct correlation between neuro-feedback and\ngetting in shape physically at a gym. Neurofeedback helps the brain\ngrow and develop normally.''\n\n   Neurofeedback is a carryover from the behavioral school of\npsychology. In the 1970s, a researcher at the Veterans\nAdministration Hospital in Sepulveda, Calif., accidentally\ndiscovered that neurofeedback could help some people control\nepileptic seizures.\n\n   The researcher, Dr. Barry Sterman, now a professor emeritus at\nthe University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, had\nconditioned cats' brain waves for a sleep study. Coincidentally, he\nused some of those cats in a study of the hazards of rocket fuel\nfor the Defense Department. Most of the cats exposed to the rocket\nfuel went into seizures, except those that had received brain wave\ntraining. Sterman then tried the technique on people with epilepsy.\n\n   Although it appeared effective, the technique was put aside in\nfavor of new drugs. Later, Dr. Joel Lubar, a psychologist at the\nUniversity of Tennessee, adapted the technique to treat attention\ndeficit disorder.\n\n   Critics agree that there is no evidence to suggest that\nneurofeedback is harmful, at least physically. But Dr. Edward\nHallowell, a psychiatrist who teaches at the Harvard Medical\nSchool, has criticized the costs. It is' not that neurofeedback\ndoes not work, said Hallowell, who wrote ``Driven to Distraction:\nRecognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from\nChildhood Through Adulthood.''\n\n   The treatment, he said, does work well for some people. He even\nrefers some patients for the treatment. ``The problem,'' he said,\n``is that it's time consuming and it's expensive. Those are real\nobstacles.''\n\n   A full course of testing and treatment ranges from $1,500 to\n$5,000 or more. While some insurance companies pay for the\ntreatment, most do not.\n\n   No one knows precisely how the brain responds to the\nneurofeedback training, though recent research on the brain's\nability to change offers some explanation.\n\n   Dr. Henry Markram, a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute\nof Science in Israel and an expert in neuroplasticity, took his\n9-year-old daughter to a psychologist in Toronto who treats ADD\nwith neurofeedback. ``It was very effective,'' he said. ``I'm very\npleased with the effects.''\n\n   ``The brain is incredibly plastic and incredibly responsive,''\nMarkram said. ``Neurofeedback is in keeping with that.\nNeurofeedback could offer a harmless first-line treatment to many\nneurological disorders.''\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nSOME SEE HOPE IN BIOFEEDBACK FOR ATTENTION DISORDER \n","Text":["\n   If a child at the Enrico Fermi School in Yonkers, N.Y., is found\nto have have attention deficit disorder, parents can choose an\nunusual alternative to medication: neurofeedback, a computerized\nbiofeedback system that some say strengthens the brain.\n","\n   Linda Vergara, the school's principal, said she was driven to\ntry the approach when doctors diagnosed the disorder in her son in\n1992. ``They told me I needed to give him something to calm him\ndown,'' she said.\n","\n   Vergara decided not to give her son Ritalin, the drug frequently\nused to treat the ailment, and instead took him to see Dr. Mary Jo\nSabo, a psychologist in Suffern, N.Y., to try neurofeedback.\n","\n   Vergara said she saw her son become calmer, and he began doing\nhis homework without being asked.
