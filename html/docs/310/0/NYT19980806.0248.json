Brain cells can\nbe damaged by the lack of blood as well as by toxic substances\nreleased during the stroke.\n\n   In the Johns Hopkins study, estrogen treatment halved the amount\nof brain damage in the rats.\n\n   ``It's a very interesting use of a native hormone,'' said study\nco-author Patricia Hurn, professor of anesthesiology and critical\ncare medicine at Johns Hopkins. Researchers aren't sure why\nestrogen might reduce stroke-related brain damage although they\nsuspect the hormone helps improve blood flow.\n\n   Hurn and others also are studying estrogen's effects in female\nrats. Preliminary results confirm female rats similarly benefit\nfrom estrogen administered before stroke.\n\n   Stroke affects 740,000 new victims in the U. S. each year, and\nis the third leading cause of death after heart disease and cancer.\nGeorgia has the third highest rate in the U. S., with 3,836\nstroke-related deaths statewide in 1993, said Dr. Michael Frankel,\nan Emory University(Ga.)stroke researcher.\n\n   Leading stroke specialist Dr. Lawrence Brass of Yale\nUniversity(Conn.) said the study results are encouraging.\n\n   ``There is tremendous evidence emerging that estrogen has many\nmore beneficial effects than we expected,'' Brass said.\n\n   Estrogen's reputation was tarnished in the 1960s, when high\ndoses of the hormone used in birth-control pills were associated\nwith a higher risk of blood clots, strokes and heart attacks.\n\n   Today, birth-control pills that contain estrogen have much lower\ndoses. Estrogen replacement therapy is increasingly considered for\npost-menopausal women, to prevent bone loss, heart disease and some\ntypes of cancer.\n\n   The Johns Hopkins study, which was funded by the National\nInstitutes of Health, was partly inspired by observations that\nstroke rates are low among younger women, but begin climbing after\nmenopause, Hurn said.\n\n   It will be long before researchers will know whether estrogen\ncan be tried as a stroke treatment for humans, however.\n\n   ``We need to do some further animal studies before the drug\ncould be considered for clinical trials,'' Hurn said.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   The female hormone estrogen someday could be used to prevent or\ntreat stroke, if beneficial effects seen in rat experiments can be\nduplicated in humans.\n","\n   Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\nin Baltimore have completed a study in which they gave male rats\nestrogen before inducing strokes.\n","\n   During a stroke, blood flow to the brain stops.
