BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Ruth had undergone a mysterious personality change that defied\npsychiatric explanation. Charles awoke each morning with a severe\nheadache that eased as the day progressed. Kathleen experienced\npartial facial paralysis, slurred her words and drooled. Marlys\nsuffered a grand mal seizure that rendered her unconscious for\nabout 15 minutes.\n\n   All four had different kinds of brain tumors. Ruth's was benign\nand grew slowly, but it was not detected for years, too late for\ntreatment that could have saved her.\n\n   Charles' tumor was malignant, and despite the best therapy\navailable at the time, he succumbed to primary brain cancer within\ntwo years.\n\n   Kathleen's tumor was also malignant, but it had not started in\nthe brain. Rather, it turned out to be the spread of a lung cancer\nthat ultimately took her life.\n\n   Marlys was the lucky one. Her benign tumor was detected by\nmodern imaging while it was small and in an area that permitted\nsurgical removal without any harm.\n\n   For reasons yet to be determined, brain tumors are becoming more\ncommon, especially in older people. The latest well-known victim is\nCardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, whose small tumor\nwas surgically removed this month at Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nCancer Center. Although the nature of the tumor has not been\nrevealed, O'Connor, 79, will be undergoing several weeks of\nradiation therapy, which is typically used to prevent the spread of\ncancer from cells that may have escaped the surgeon's scalpel.\n\n   Since the mid-1980s, the yearly total of Americans given\ndiagnoses of brain tumors has doubled, and it is expected to exceed\n100,000 this year. More than half the increase has occurred in\npeople over 65.\n\n   Survival rates, too, have been inching up, thanks to improved\ndiagnostic techniques and more precise and inventive treatments,\nlike stereotactic radiosurgery (a pinpoint form of radiation) and\nlaser surgery with a gamma knife. More progress is expected to\nresult from some still experimental treatments, including\nimmunotherapy, gene therapy and implanted wafers of\nchemotherapeutic agents.\n\n   Only about 20 percent of brain tumors are primary _ that is,\ntumors that start in brain tissue. Half of these are brain cancers,\nand half are benign tumors that can nonetheless become life\nthreatening because they grow inside a skull that cannot expand. As\nthey do, they can press on vital tissues, which may sometimes\npreclude their removal.\n\n   The remaining 80 percent of brain tumors are secondary,\noriginating from cancers elsewhere in the body _ although, as in\nKathleen's case, the primary cancer is sometimes not detected until\nafter the metastatic brain tumor has been found. Lung, breast and\ncolon cancers, as well as melanomas, often spread to the brain.\n\n   There has been much speculatin about the possible causes of\nbrain cancers, and especially their apparent increase. About 5\npercent are hereditary. Among suggested environmental factors are\nlow-energy electromagnetic fields from objects like cellular\nphones, power lines and household appliances, although considerable\nresearch into the matter has yet to yield any definitive evidence\nof such a risk. To be sure, high-dose radiation delivered to the\nhead, including therapy for brain tumors, can increase the risk of\nbrain cancer. There is no link, however, to low-dose radiation\ndelivered through diagnostic X-rays or workplace exposure to\nionizing radiation.\n\n   But industrial chemicals may be a problem. Workers regularly\nexposed to substances like acrylonitrite, vinyl chloride,\nformaldehyde, lubricating oils, N-nitroso compounds, phenols,\npesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and organic solvents\ndevelop brain tumors with greater than average frequency. Pregnant\nwomen and parents of infants should be especially careful to avoid\nsuch chemicals because animal studies indicate that exposure in\nutero and in infancy incurs the greatest risk.\n\n   Also, pregnant women would be wise to take supplements\ncontaining vitamins C, A, E and folate through their pregnancies. A\nthree-continent study indicated that the children of women who took\nsuch vitamins were half as likely as the children of nontakers to\ndevelop brain tumors before age 5.\n\n   Benign brain tumors can often be treated successfully, although\nthere may be lasting effects, depending on size and location. But\nbecause the most common type of brain cancer, glioblastoma\nmultiforme, is fast-growing and highly invasive, and because early\nsymptoms of brain tumors often mimic other problems, delaying\ndiagnosis, brain cancer is associated with a five-year survival\nrate of only 30 percent. This rate is half that for cancers\noverall, but still much better than the survival rates for cancers\nof the lung, pancreas and esophagus.\n\n   The problem with brain tumors is their ability to grow silently\nfor years and, when they finally do produce symptoms, become\nconfused with other problems like migraine headaches, inner ear\nproblems, epilepsy or stroke. For example, Kathleen, who had speech\nproblems and drooling, thought at first she might have had a\nstroke.\n\n   If everyone with symptoms like headache, dizziness, nausea,\nvomiting, memory loss, personality or behavioral change, hearing\nproblems, difficulty walking, decreased sensation, seizures or\nblurred or double vision underwent a thorough workup for a brain\ntumor, it could easily overwhelm the health care system. But if\nsuch symptoms persist or keep recurring, patients should insist on\nbeing examined for possible brain tumors.\n\n   A proper diagnostic workup should include a complete\nneurological exam, including abstract thinking and memory tests and\na scan of the brain.\n\n   The treatment of choice depends on the patient's age (children\nunder 3 are generally not given radiation therapy), the size and\nlocation of the tumor, the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation\nand chemotherapy, and the general health of the patient. The three\ncommon cancer treatments _ surgery, radiation therapy and\nchemotherapy _ are most often used for brain tumors as well. But\nthere are now highly sophisticated ways of ``operating'' on the\nbrain, including the use of pinpoint radiation and laser beams that\ncan destroy the tumor without damaging normal surrounding tissue.\n\n   A large number of clinical trials are also under way, exploring\nthe potential of new chemotherapeutic techniques and immunotherapy.\nIn fact, patients are often encouraged to enroll in a trial.
