It is one of the most potent of substances\nknown as ``angiogenesis inhibitors'' that work by blocking the\ngrowth of small blood vessels tumors need to grow; the drugs don't\ndirectly attack tumors.\n\n   Angiostatin has not yet been tested in humans, but it and\nanother drug from Folkman's lab, endostatin, have shown powerful\ntumor-shrinking effects in mice. The drugs are being developed by\nthe National Cancer Institute and a biotech company with hopes of\ninitial human trials sometime next year.\n\n   ``I'd give it to patients tomorrow'' if it were available, said\nWeichselbaum of angiostatin. He noted that the substance, a natural\nprotein found in the body, is apparently non-toxic in mice and that\nit worked even when given for only a few days.\n\n   At present, angiostatin is available only in minute amounts from\nresearchers who make it through a laborious process in their\nlaboratories. It won't be available for testing in combination with\nradiation or other therapies until it passes stringent safety tests\nin a small number of patients, which will be in 1999 at the\nearliest. The angiostatin used in the experiments was made at\nNorthwestern University, said Weichselbaum.\n\n   The scientists tested radiation and angiostatin separately on\nmice, some that had mouse lung cancers and others that had human\ntumors created by injecting them with human cancer cells. The\nresulting tumors were large, in some cases weighing as much as 5\n1/2 percent of the animal's body weight.\n\n   Then the researchers combined injections of angiostatin in low\ndoses with radiation therapy. In one group of experiments using\nmice with transplanted human larynx cancers, the combination\ntreatment shrank tumors by an average of 64 percent compared with\nreductions of 16 percent and 18 percent respectively with\nangiostatin alone or radiation alone.\n\n   When they carried out autopsies on the mice, the researchers\ndiscovered something surprising: the angiostatin and radiation had\nshrunk the tumors by destroying the blood vessels, not by killing\nthe cancer directly. This was a surprise, said Weichselbaum in a\ntelephone interview, because radiation usually works by damaging\nthe DNA, or genetic material, in cancer cells _ not by targeting a\ntumor's blood vessels.\n\n   The angiostatin, he said, apparently made the blood vessels more\nsensitive to radiation, so that the radiation ``really poops out''\nthe vessels and causes them to shrivel away.\n\n   The results point in the future to combining angiogenesis\ninhibitors not just with radiation but also with other DNA-damaging\nagents like chemotherapy drugs as a new way to increase the potency\nof cancer treatment without adding toxic side effects, said\nWeichselbaum.\n\n   Folkman, in an interview, termed the findings ``a beautiful new\nphenomenon'' that underscores the likely role of angiogenesis\ninhibitors as team players in future cancer treatment.\n\n   ``It's taking well-known conventional therapies (such as\nradiation), which are OK in themselves but have a lot of side\neffects, and increasing their power'' through angiostatin's ability\nto focus the radiation damage on the tumor's blood vessels, while\nsparing the surrounding normal tissue.\n\n   ``I think what they're doing,'' Folkman said of the report's\nauthors, ``is making anti-angiogenic radiotherapy'' _ in effect, a\nnew form of cancer treatment.\n","Headline":"\nTUMOR-STARVING DRUG FOUND TO BOOST RADIATION TREATMENT IN MICE \n","Text":["\n   Angiostatin, a tumor-starving drug from the laboratory of\nHarvard's Dr. Judah Folkman, dramatically boosts the anticancer\neffect of radiation treatment in mice without causing additional\nside effects, researchers are reporting today.\n","\n   When the experimental drug was combined with standard doses of\nradiation, human tumors implanted in mice stopped growing or shrank\nto a far greater degree than with either treatment alone, say the\nscientists.\n","\n   If effective in humans, the synergistic combination ``could make\nradiation much more effective at providing local control of\ncancer'' including prostate, brain, head and neck cancers,\nsoft-tissue sarcomas and others, said Dr. Ralph Weichselbaum,\nchairman of radiation oncology at the University of Chicago, and\nlead author of the report in the current Nature.\n","\n   The other authors are from Harvard Medical School and\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical\nCenter, and Northwestern University.\n","\n   Angiostatin was discovered in Folkman's laboratory at Children's\nHospital in Boston.
