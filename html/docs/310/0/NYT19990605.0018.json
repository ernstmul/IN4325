WILLIAMS  \n c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors have\ntwice tried to convict Clarence Dexter of murdering his wife. \n\n   Dexter's first trial ended in a mistrial. A murder verdict in\nhis second trial was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court\nbecause lawyers talked in court about how Dexter was silent when\narrested.  \n\n   Now the third trial, set to begin Monday in Clay County, is in\ntrouble because prosecutors cannot find a police 911 tape, samples\nof a T-shirt Dexter allegedly wore the night of his wife's murder,\nbullet fragments from the autopsy and a newspaper with a bloody\nfootprint.  \n\n   Prosecutors are nervous and the victim's family is angry.  \n\n   Dexter is accused of shooting his 50-year-old wife, Carol\nDexter, four times at their Kansas City, North, home on Nov. 18,\n1990. He then allegedly went to a supermarket. When he returned,\nDexter allegedly saw that his wife was not dead and then beat her\nwith a hammer.  \n\n   Dexter, 57, has contended that he discovered his wife's body\nafter returning from the supermarket.  \n\n   Defense lawyers discovered the evidence was missing earlier this\nspring when they wanted to have their own scientists compare the\nbloody footprint to Dexter's shoe. When the lawyers opened an\nevidence bag, they found several pieces of newspaper, but the\nbloodied newspaper was gone.  \n\n   That prompted an inventory of the case's evidence, and it was\nthen that several critical items were discovered missing.  \n\n   Special prosecutors Tim Finnical and Victoria Thomas have\nsearched for the evidence in the Kansas City Police Department\nproperty room, the Clay County prosecutor's property room and the\nMissouri attorney general's office.  \n\n   ``The whole family is upset. We want justice served,'' said the\nvictim's brother, Olan Thrasher. ``Evidently their filing system is\nnot too good.''  \n\n   Thrasher, however, said he has confidence in the prosecutors.  \n\n   ``They still have a lot of evidence,'' Thrasher said. ``I just\nhope these (missing) two or three pieces don't jeopardize the whole\ncase.''  \n\n   At a pretrial hearing last month, Kansas City Regional Crime Lab\ncriminologist John Wilson said the evidence might have gotten\nscrambled during one of Dexter's earlier trials.  \n\n   In Dexter's first trial in July 1991, the jury deliberated more\nthan eight hours without reaching a verdict.  \n\n   A jury in his second trial in October 1991 convicted him. A Clay\nCounty judge sentenced Dexter to execution after the jury could not\ndecide between death and life without parole.  \n\n   The verdict was overturned in 1997 by the Missouri Supreme\nCourt. The high court ruled unanimously that Dexter's 14th\nAmendment right of due process was violated because lawyers talked\nin court about how Dexter was silent after he was arrested and read\nhis rights.  \n\n   The missing evidence will make next week's trial much different\nthan Dexter's earlier trials, said Cyndy Short, a public defender\non Dexter's defense team.  \n\n   Short said Dexter's link to the crime is weakened without the\nevidence.  \n\n   Prosecutors said the 911 tape contains Dexter's call to the\npolice after his wife's death. The shirt samples contain blood\nstains that could show whether Dexter was present during the murder\nor whether he bloodied his clothes when he discovered his wife's\nbody, prosecutors said.  \n\n   At the pretrial hearing, defense forensic consultant Gene\nGietzen said a picture of the bloody footprint did not appear to\nmatch Dexter's shoes.  \n\n   ``I could have done better analysis if the newspaper had been\npreserved,'' Gietzen said.  \n\n   How the clothing samples and the bullet fragments were handled\nin the Dexter case also was discussed at the hearing.  \n\n   Wilson the criminologist said in 1991 Clay County prosecutors\noften had lab technicians bring lab samples to a trial.  \n\n   He said other area prosecutors only asked for the lab reports\nand the actual evidence. Lab samples, such as the clothing samples\nand the bullet fragments, remain at the lab.  \n\n   ``Remnants stay in the lab frozen so you can test them later,''\nWilson said.  \n\n   Clay County prosecutor's office spokesman Jim Roberts said that\nat the time of Dexter's earlier trials, the office usually kept\nevidence until the police asked for it. Murder case evidence was\nreturned to the police immediately after trial, Roberts said.  \n\n   ``Our new practice is that the agency that brings the evidence\nis the one to bring it to trial and to take it back,'' Roberts\nsaid.  \n\n   Wilson said what might have happened is that the lab samples\nmight have been mixed with other evidence and mistakenly returned\nto the Kansas City Police Department.  \n\n   Wilson testified that lab records showed that additional bullet\nfragments collected at the Dexter crime scene were checked out from\nthe lab by a former assistant prosecutor, but the record did not\nshow that the fragments were ever returned.  \n\n   However, those fragments recently were found mixed with other\nevidence in the case in the police property room, said Tom\nJacquinot, a public defender on Dexter's defense team.  \n","Headline":"\nMAN'S THIRD MURDER TRIAL IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF MISSING EVIDENCE \n","Text":["\n   Dexter's first trial ended in a mistrial.
