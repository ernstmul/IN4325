HALL  \n c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  \n\n         Scientists have discovered new nerve cells sprouting deep\nwithin the adult human brain, undercutting the ancient biological\ndogma that dead brain cells can never be replaced.\n\n   Neurons _ the precious functional cells of the central nervous\nsystem _ have been thought to stop multiplying about the same time\nchildren lose their baby teeth, then gradually die off throughout\nadulthood.\n\n   Now, it seems that certain regions of the brain may remain young\n_ or at least able to carry on a process known as ``neurogenesis''\nwell into adulthood.\n\n   The research findings, published Friday in the journal Nature\nMedicine, could lead to new ways to treat brain diseases and\nstrokes that destroy vast populations of brain cells.\n\n   If even a few cells with the power to regenerate could be\nharvested from such patients, doctors might be able to induce them\nto grow in a laboratory dish and then graft them back into the\ndiseased area, in the same way that some burn victims can be\ntreated with grafts of freshly grown skin cells.\n\n   ``There's enormous potential,'' said Dr. Ben Barres, a\nneurobiologist at Stanford Medical Center.\n\n   The new study was done by researchers in Sweden and at the Salk\nInstitute for Biological Studies in San Diego. They took advantage\nof a special dye, called BrdU, that had been injected into\nlate-stage cancer patients in order to label actively dividing\ncells.\n\n   When the patients eventually died, autopsies revealed clear\nevidence of new neurons within the hippocampus, a region of the\ncerebral cortex involved in learning and memory. The study subjects\nwere gravely ill and in their 50s and 60s (one was 72) when the\ncellular rebirth was occurring.\n\n   ``Our study demonstrates that cell genesis occurs in human\nbrains and that the human brain retains the potential for\nself-renewal throughout life,'' the researchers concluded.\n\n   The newborn cells could be a previously unknown mechanism in the\nelaborate circuit-building system that the brain uses to lay down\nmemories. Thus, the research implies, learning new things might be\nphysically expanding brain capacity even in late adulthood.\n\n   But study co-author Fred Gage of the Salk Institute noted that\nthere is still no evidence that the late-blooming neurons actually\nassumed any functional role.\n\n   Mature neurons typically form elaborate branches and connections\nwith other cells to transmit nerve impulses. The newborn cells\nidentified in the study formed in a primitive state from so-called\nprogenitor cells.\n\n   That represents a cellular fresh start for an adult brain, but\nno one knows whether that is merely a trivial vestige of childhood\nor a dynamic element of the adult's neurobiology.\n\n   The biochemical signals that trigger neurogenesis also remain a\nmystery. Unlike other organs, the brain shows little tendency to\nrepair itself when damage occurs.\n\n   ``All we have done is show there are some new neurons here,''\nGage said. ``We don't know if those new neurons can become wired up\ncorrectly.''\n","Headline":"\nFIRST EVIDENCE OF NEW BRAIN CELLS IN HUMAN ADULTS \n","Text":["\n         Scientists have discovered new nerve cells sprouting deep\nwithin the adult human brain, undercutting the ancient biological\ndogma that dead brain cells can never be replaced.\n","\n   Neurons _ the precious functional cells of the central nervous\nsystem _ have been thought to stop multiplying about the same time\nchildren lose their baby teeth, then gradually die off throughout\nadulthood.\n","\n   Now, it seems that certain regions of the brain may remain young\n_ or at least able to carry on a process known as ``neurogenesis''\nwell into adulthood.\n","\n   The research findings, published Friday in the journal Nature\nMedicine, could lead to new ways to treat brain diseases and\nstrokes that destroy vast populations of brain cells.\n","\n   If even a few cells with the power to regenerate could be\nharvested from such patients, doctors might be able to induce them\nto grow in a laboratory dish and then graft them back into the\ndiseased area, in the same way that some burn victims can be\ntreated with grafts of freshly grown skin cells.\n","\n   ``There's enormous potential,'' said Dr. Ben Barres, a\nneurobiologist at Stanford Medical Center.\n","\n   The new study was done by researchers in Sweden and at the Salk\nInstitute for Biological Studies in San Diego.
