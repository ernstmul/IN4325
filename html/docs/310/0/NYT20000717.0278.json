We can say there is a statistical association''\nbetween environmental exposure and breast cancer, says Deborah\nThompson, a doctoral student in the University of Massachusett's\nDepartment of Work Environment.\n\n   She and a team of researchers did the study, which looked at the\nexposure of almost 5,000 women to metalworking fluids between\nl940-1996. She received no financing from the auto industry; the\nfinal study results are being completed this summer.\n\n   The researchers think that toxic components _ like polyaromatic\nhydrocarbons, biocides, nitrosamines and chlorinated paraffins _ in\nthe metalworking fluids react with the female hormonal system,\nelevating the risk of breast cancer. In this scenario, the fluids\nbehave like estrogen and attach themselves to cells in the fatty\nbreast tissue. Such fluids are commonly used in industrial\nworkplaces to cool and lubricate parts during machining.\n\n   Thompson says, ``once they form a bond with the receptors in the\nbreast, they are absorbed into the cell's nucleus, setting off a\ncascade of disregulated growth leading to carcinogenesis.''\n\n   These results are the latest to come out of this entire group of\n50,000 auto workers (45,000 are men). Previous studies on this\nwhole group have linked them to a risk of cancers of the larynx,\nesophagus and pancreas. In Thompson's study, they only looked at\nwomen and also took into account the family history of breast\ncancer, lifestyle and whether they had children.\n\n   ``We anticipated a negative study and were surprised to find an\nassociation between environmental pollutants and breast cancer,''\nshe says. They measured the risk by calculating how much of these\ncompounds were in the air and found that when they reached a\ncertain amount, the risk increased 20 percent. That amount was a\nmilligram of metalworking fluid per cubic meter of air per year,\nand was added up over time to arrive at a risk level.\n\n   Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the U.S.\nMore than 180,000 women will be diagnosed with it this year, and\nmore than 40,000 will die of it this year, according to the\nAmerican Cancer Society.\n\n   ``It looks to me like there may be a lot of hazardous things out\nthere in the workplace and the environment that might put us at\nrisk, not just for breast cancer, but for other hormonally related\ncancers, for example, ovarian and prostate,'' she Thompson. The\ndifficulty lies in how to measure these hazards.\n\n   Thompson added that this study, as others before it, was done\nwith permission from the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) and\nGeneral Motors (GM), both of which have formed a scientific board\nto evaluate the worth of each piece of research. Despite repeated\nphone calls over two weeks, neither the UAW nor GM would respond to\nquestions from HealthSCOUT.\n\n   Betsy Mullen, executive director of the Women's Informational\nNetwork Against Breast Cancer in San Diego, embraces the results of\nthis study and sees it as indicating there may be even broader\nproblems. Pesticides and other chemicals _ in the water we drink\nand the air we breathe _ have been linked to cancer, she says. And\ncancer rates are rising. ``Everywhere you look, somebody's been\nimpacted, and we have to look at the big picture _ the\nenvironment.''\n\n   Thompson's study was funded by the Massachusetts Department of\nPublic Health Breast Cancer Research Program.\n\n   -----\n\n   (The HealthScout.com Web site is at http://www.HealthScout.com.)\n","Headline":"\nWOMEN ON AUTO ASSEMBLY LINES HAVE MORE RISK OF BREAST CANCER  \n      \n     \n","Text":["\n   Women who put together America's cars may be up to 20 percent\nlikelier to get breast cancer than other women, say preliminary\nresults of a study.\n","\n   The exposure of automotive assembly-line workers to metalworking\nfluids over time increased their chances of getting the disease,\nbut environmental epidemiologists at the University of\nMassachusetts/Lowell, who did the study, are quick to add that this\ndoes not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.\n","\n   ``We cannot say that exposure to metalworking fluids is the\ncause of disease.
