They brought in Tom Fitzgerald as\ncaptain, drawing on his experience with Florida's expansion team in\n1993.\n\n   ``We weren't sure what to expect,'' center Scott Walker said.\n``Tom had been through it before and he told us that if we relied\non each other, expected a lot from each other, worked hard and\nplayed hard, we would have a lot of fun. People would be willing to\ngive us a break if we gave an honest effort. It's not fun when you\nare losing 8-0, but we've beaten some good teams and it's not like\nwe're sacrificial lambs.''\n\n   Nashville has not been at full strength, though.\n\n   ``Basically, we've been going with our No. 2 and 3 goaltenders\nand with six or seven guys out of the lineup and we keep plodding\nalong and getting some wins,'' Trotz said. ``In the past, some\nexpansion teams would probably have crumbled, but we've stayed\ntogether. Sometimes you have to look past the names on the jerseys.\nSome players who have name value in the league are not much\ndifferent than the guys we have, who don't have the name value. You\nmight have never heard of them, but they do a great job.\n\n   ``We're in the playoff race and I don't think anybody expected\nthat. From Day 1, our expectations have been to be competitive on a\nnightly basis, and so far we've attained that. Secondly, we wanted\nto win on a consistent basis. Thirdly, we want to make the\nplayoffs. On the ice, we don't match up with any team. Every team\nis more experienced, bigger, or they have more skill. There are not\na lot of areas we can say we're better. But we work hard and we've\ngotten good goaltending and done the simple things.''\n","Headline":"\nPREDATORS NO LONGER THE PREY \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ The Bruins are expected to break their three-game\nwinless streak when they meet Nashville Monday.
