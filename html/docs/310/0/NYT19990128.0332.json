KNOX  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   Giving breast cancer patients chemotherapy before surgery _ a\nreversal of the usual order _ shrinks many large breast tumors\nenough to qualify women for lumpectomy instead of more radical\nsurgery, researchers report.\n\n   The chemo-first approach sometimes leads to a more dramatic\nresult: dissolving even microscopic traces of malignancy.\n\n   One in eight women with large breast tumors or malignancy that\nhad spread to nearby lymph nodes had such ``complete remissions''\nfrom presurgical chemotherapy. Nearly 90 percent of these lucky\nwomen were alive and cancer-free five years after treatment, a rate\nthat parallels survival of women diagnosed at the earliest stages\nof disease.\n\n   The largest impact of putting chemotherapy first, the Texas\nresearchers said, would be to spare many more women from breast\namputation.\n\n   Dr. S. Eva Singletary of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston\nsaid the chemo-first approach can safely provide many thousands of\nbreast cancer patients an alternative to mastectomy now offered\nonly to women with the smallest malignancies.\n\n   ``Usually surgeons consider lumpectomy only for small breast\ntumors,'' said Singletary, herself a surgeon. ``We're saying: Wait\na minute, you can give chemo, shrink that large tumor to a small\none, and do a lumpectomy safely.''\n\n   About half of all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer\ncurrently undergo mastectomy, in which the breast is removed along\nwith nearby lymph nodes in an attempt to excise malignant cells\nthat can lead to recurrence of the disease.\n\n   The new approach, which so far is being done only in some\nacademic cancer centers, may apply to about 45 percent of newly\ndiagnosed breast cancer cases. That translates to about 81,000\nAmerican women annually, out of 179,000 new diagnoses.\n\n   In other words, if US surgeons adopted the chemo-first approach,\nthe nation's mastectomy rate would plummet _ apparently without\nraising the risk of breast cancer recurrence.\n\n   ``Certainly there appears to be no disadvantage with going with\npreoperative chemo first,'' Singletary said in an interview.\n``There's nothing wrong with doing surgery first, but going with\nchemo first is safe, it's effective, and it may make the surgery\nless radical. So you haven't lost anything.''\n\n   The evidence comes from an analysis of two separate studies of\nbreast cancer patients who got varying combinations of chemotherapy\ndrugs before and after surgery, with or without supplemental\nradiation to the affected breast and regional lymph nodes.\n\n   The 372 women in the two studies had ``locally advanced'' breast\ncancer, classified as Stage II or Stage III. That means their tumor\nwas larger than 1 centimeter in diameter at diagnosis or that\ncancer cells were found in nearby lymph nodes. In fact, the average\ntumor among women in the studies measured six centimeters across, a\nsize that would rule out lumpectomy.\n\n   Some patients also had skin puckering from the underlying tumor\nor positive lymph nodes above the collarbone, giving them a\nless-favorable prognosis. But none in the Texas studies had\nevidence of malignancy in the liver, bones, or brain.\n\n   Giving these women chemotherapy first shrank the breast tumors\nby more than half in 80 percent of the study subjects. Sixteen\npercent had their breast tumors disappear entirely, and 12 percent\nhad no microscopic evidence of malignancy in either breast or lymph\nnode tissue.\n\n   Paradoxically, women with such ``complete responses'' were more\nlikely to have more aggressive tumors. Because malignant cells in\nsuch tumors are dividing faster, they give anticancer drugs more\nopportunities to kill them.\n\n   Researchers cannot yet claim an overall survival advantage from\nthe chemo-first approach, partly because they have not studied\nenough cases. In ongoing studies, they are adding taxol to other\ndrugs to see if they can demonstrate a long-term survival advantage\namong women who do not achieve a complete remission from\nchemotherapy alone.\n\n   The new analysis, published in the current issue of the Journal\nof Clinical Oncology, may not convince many doctors to try\nchemotherapy first because it is not based on random assignment of\nwomen to this approach versus the traditional one, in which\npatients receive anticancer drugs only after surgical removal of\nthe breast tumor.\n\n   Singletary said ongoing studies, and some on the drawing board,\nwill provide more data. For instance, the Houston researchers are\nconducting a trial in which all chemotherapy is done ``up front,''\nor before surgery. Prior studies have split drug treatments into\npre- and post-surgical components.\n\n   In recent years, studies have shown that chemotherapy\nsubstantially improves survival in women who have breast lumps\nmeasuring more than 1 centimeter at the time of diagnosis. Thus,\nmany women receive chemotherapy already, and the Texas researchers\nsay the issue now is one of timing.\n\n   The Houston specialist advised women facing breast cancer\nsurgery and subsequent chemotherapy to ask her doctor whether he or\nshe would consider giving chemotherapy first.\n\n   ``If a woman is told, `You need a mastectomy because your tumor\nis too large,' she should ask, `What about the option of using\nchemo to downstage this tumor to see if I could be a candidate for\nlumpectomy?' '' Singletary advised.\n\n   In another cancer study in the British journal The Lancet, Dutch\ndoctors claimed partial success in using a vaccine against colon\ncancer made from patients' own cancer cells.\n\n   The experimental vaccine reportedly reduced the risk of\nrecurrence among colon cancer patients with Stage II disease, which\nmeans malignancy that has penetrated the bowel wall but has not\nspread to area lymph nodes.\n\n   However, Dr. Robert Mayer of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a\ncolon cancer authority, called the results ``pretty inconclusive''\nbecause of the study's small number of subjects and what he called\n``marginal benefits'' in only a subgroup of patients.\n","Headline":"\nCHEMOTHERAPY BEFORE SURGERY AIDS BREAST CANCER PATIENTS \n","Text":["\n   Giving breast cancer patients chemotherapy before surgery _ a\nreversal of the usual order _ shrinks many large breast tumors\nenough to qualify women for lumpectomy instead of more radical\nsurgery, researchers report.\n","\n   The chemo-first approach sometimes leads to a more dramatic\nresult: dissolving even microscopic traces of malignancy.\n","\n   One in eight women with large breast tumors or malignancy that\nhad spread to nearby lymph nodes had such ``complete remissions''\nfrom presurgical chemotherapy.
