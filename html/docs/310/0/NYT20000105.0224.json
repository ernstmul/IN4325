Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ On a bright, crisp Friday morning in November, Martin\nCooper was sipping orange juice in the dining room of the Essex\nHouse hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan when his\nwell-planned day fell apart. One meeting had to be rescheduled and\nanother had to be relocated even though one of Cooper's colleagues\nwas already en route to the old location.\n\n   Cell phones were produced and arrangements quietly changed (so\nas not to annoy nearby diners). Six calls and 10 minutes later, the\nsituation was resolved.\n\n   ``Thank goodness for cell phones'' is something we might say to\nourselves when we're not busy cursing the lack of a signal or the\nshrill ring that cuts into a quiet dinner. What made those\nsentiments resonate on that morning was that Cooper, a former\ngeneral manager for the systems division at Motorola, is considered\nthe inventor of the first portable handset and the first person to\nmake a call on a portable cell phone.\n\n   ``Yes, I was the one people credit with inventing the cell\nphone,'' Cooper, 70, said almost sheepishly. ``Now, whenever anyone\ngets a dropped call, they blame me.''\n\n   Thirty minutes later, a few blocks down Sixth Avenue, Cooper was\natop the 50-story Alliance Capital Building, looking for the base\nstation that processed the first hand-held cell phone call in 1973.\n(Noncellular Car phones had been use since the late 1950s.) With\nrooftop gravel crunching under his feet, he approached what looked\nlike the entrance to an engine room. Dozens of dish antennas lined\nthe perimeter of the building's roof.\n\n   Cooper pulled the door open and stepped into a dimly lighted\nspace. Inside, rows of cages secured dozens of transmitters that\ncontrolled the thousands of mobile phone calls coursing through the\noutside antennas. Stepping into a cage marked with a Motorola sign,\nCooper brightened up.\n\n   ``That's it,'' he said with almost childlike enthusiasm,\npointing to a six-foot-high metallic box filled with old circuit\nboards and transistors, and a Motorola stamp. ``I can't say it's\nthe one, but it looks exactly like what we brought up here in\n1973.''\n\n   Back then, Motorola was known for its expertise in radio\ncommunications and terminals. In 1973, when the company installed\nthe base station to handle the first public demonstration of a\nphone call over the cellular network, Motorola was trying to\npersuade the Federal Communications Commission to allocate\nfrequency space to private companies for use in the emerging\ntechnology of cellular communications.\n\n   But the company faced formidable competition in AT&T. It was\nAT&T's research arm, Bell Laboratories, that introduced the idea of\ncellular communications in 1947.\n\n   ``AT&T wanted to run the whole wireless world,'' Cooper said.\n\n   Back then, Bell Laboratories wanted the first system limited to\ncar phones. Cooper wanted people to be able to carry their phones\nwith them anywhere. While crediting Bell Laboratories with\ntechnical brilliance, Cooper believed that giving them the whole\nspectrum would cause a huge delay in making cellular phones\nportable.\n\n   ``Bell Labs was an extraordinary operation, but we were living\nin the real world,'' he said.\n\n   After some initial testing in Washington, for the FCC, Cooper\nand Motorola took the phone technology to New York to show the\npublic.\n\n   At the time, Richard Frenkiel was the head of systems\nengineering for Bell Laboratories. ``It was a real triumph,'' he\nsaid about Cooper's phone. ``We were using 30-pound units in the\ntrunks of cars. So their ability to package the whole thing into a\n2-pound unit was a great breakthrough.''\n\n   On April 3, 1973 standing on a street near the Manhattan Hilton,\nCooper decided to attempt a private call before going to a press\nconference upstairs in the hotel. He picked up the two-pound\nMotorola handset called the Dyna-Tac and pushed the ``off hook''\nbutton. The phone came alive, connecting Cooper with the base\nstation on the roof of the Burlington Consolidated Tower (now the\nAlliance Capital Building) and into the land-line system. To the\nbewilderment of some passers-by, he dialed the number and held the\nphone to his ear.\n\n   Who did he call for this historic event?\n\n   ``The first call I made was to Joel Engel, the Bell Labs head of\nresearch,'' Cooper said. ``I think they were a little bit annoyed.\nThey thought it was impertinent for a company like Motorola to go\nafter them.''\n\n   Engel, now a telecommunications consultant, does not remember\nthe first call so clearly. ``Marty may very well have given me the\nhonor of being the first recipient of a call from that hand-held\nunit, but I just don't remember it,'' he said.\n\n   nn\n\n   Engel does recall the intense effort by Motorola to make a place\nfor itself in the cellular world: ``Give Marty Cooper credit for\nthe foresight in recognizing that the business was going towards\nhand-helds and not the car. It was as much a marketing insight as\nit was a technological breakthrough.''\n\n   The public demonstration landed Motorola's mobile unit on the\nJuly, 1973 cover of Popular Science magazine, which referred to it\nas a ``new type of computerized, walkie-talkie-size portable.'' It\nalso seems to have had some effect on the FCC, which decided to\ngive more space to private companies to foster competition in\ncellular communications.\n\n   ``I think Ma Bell was impressed that little a could make\nsuch a huge PR flash against that behemoth,'' Cooper said.\n\n   Cooper grew up in Chicago and earned a degree in electrical\nengineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. After four\nyears in the Navy serving on destroyers and a submarine, he worked\nfor a year at a telecommunications company he described as ``100\nengineers in a big room with no air conditioning.''\n\n   Hired by Motorola in 1954, Cooper worked on developing portable\nproducts, including the first portable hand-held police radios,\nmade for the Chicago police department in 1967. He then led\nMotorola's cellular research.\n\n   He left Motorola in 1983, the year that the first cellular\nsystems became commercially available. After starting, then selling\na company that managed billing for cellular companies, Cooper was\nan independent consultant until he founded his current venture,\nArrayComm, in 1992.\n\n   ``Initially, I was supposed to spend a day a month as an\nadviser,'' he said. ``But soon, I was working seven days a week.\nWhen you get involved in a startup, you have to be passionate.''\n\n   The company was originally focused on creating smart antennas\nthat mobile phone providers could install to increase capacity\nwithout building new transmitters. Cooper is now passionate about\ntrying to change the way we use the Internet. Harkening back to\nwhen he worked to move people away from thinking of cell phones as\nanchored to cars, Cooper applies the same thinking to the Internet.\n\n   ``Cellular was the forerunner to true wireless communications,''\nhe says. ``And just as people got used to taking phones with them\neverywhere, the way people use the Internet is ultimately going to\nbe wireless. With our technology, you will be able to open your\nnotebook anywhere and log on to the Internet at a very high speed\nwith relatively low cost.''\n\n   ``At the moment, our story is about what a relatively small\ncompany is doing with high-tech stuff in Silicon Valley.\n\n   ``But when people get used to logging on anywhere, well, that's\ngoing to be a revolution.''\n\n   It is a revolution in which he wants to play an important role.\n``I have trouble going to sleep at night,'' he said, ``because you\nalways get the feeling that there is another thing you could do.''\n","Headline":"\nCELL PHONE RUIN THE OPERA?
