Times News Service   \n\n   Two years ago, as Charles Finnie, an investment banker in San\nFrancisco, was driving home from work, he did what he did nearly\nevery time he got in the car: he picked up his cell phone and\nstarted dialing. Eyes averted from the road, he slammed into the\ncar in front of him. No one was injured, but the impact jammed\nFinnie's door shut. So he climbed out through the sun roof _ still\ntalking on the phone.\n\n   The cell phone is maligned far and wide as an instrument not\njust of rudeness but also of physical harm. People hear about it\nemitting cancer-causing microwaves, disrupting pacemakers and\ncausing navigational confusion in airplanes. Just last week, an\nairline passenger in Britain was sentenced to a year in prison for\nendangering a flight by refusing to switch off his mobile phone.\n\n   But the debate with the most momentum these days is the one\nsurrounding cell phones as potential driving hazards.\n\n   Phoning while driving has been banned in several countries,\nincluding Israel, Spain, Brazil and parts of Australia. After a\nJapanese study found that the number of traffic accidents related\nto car phones increased by 11 percent in Japan from 1997 to 1998,\ndriving with a cell phone in hand was banned there, too.\n\n   Recent fatal car accidents around the nation have been\nattributed to drivers who were distracted because they were using\ntheir mobile phones. Last March, Brooklyn, Ohio, a Cleveland\nsuburb, made it illegal to use a cell phone handset while driving,\nand the phones are now off-limits to New York cabdrivers.\n\n   The concern is understandable. Anyone who has reached for a\nringing cell phone or dialed while at the steering wheel knows the\nphones are distracting. The question is whether they pose such a\ndanger that they should be banished from drivers' hands.\n\n   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation, a trade group in Washington, there are nearly 77\nmillion cell phones in use in the United States, and a new customer\nsigns up every 1.25 seconds. A 1997 survey by the National Highway\nTraffic Safety Administration found that nearly 9 out of 10 cell\ntelephone owners used them at least occasionally while driving.\n\n   ``This is a very rapidly moving field,'' said Mark Burris, a\nresearch associate at the Center for Urban Transportation Research\nat the University of South Florida in Tampa, which recently\nreleased a report on cell phone use by drivers. ``The rapid\ndecrease in cost of a cell phone means a lot more people have\naccess to them, and a lot of people are driving. Put the two\ntogether and this could be a major problem.''\n\n   Cell phones in the car are, of course, a distraction like many\nothers. Reaching for a cell phone is no different, really, than\nstretching for a cassette, unwrapping a cheeseburger or turning\naround to scold a child. But the public image of many cell phone\nusers _ as pushy, self-important multitaskers _ highlights the\noffense.\n\n   Several studies have examined the potential hazards of talking\non a cell phone while driving. The one most widely cited was\nconducted by researchers at the University of Toronto and published\nin The New England Journal of Medicine in 1997.\n\n   While pointing out that cellular telephones could be used in\nemergencies to summon help (eventually they will all be able to\nreport their locations as well), enhancing drivers' safety, the\nstudy concluded that talking on a cell phone while driving was as\ndangerous as driving while at the threshold of legal intoxication.\nThat is, the risk of a collision when using a cell phone was found\nto be four times as high as the risk when a cell phone was not\nbeing used.\n\n   An author of the study, Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a professor of\nmedicine at the University of Toronto, said it was the distraction\nof the conversation itself, not the act of dialing or holding the\nphone, that accounted for most of the increased risk. For that\nreason, hands-free phones do not solve the problem and may even\nworsen it, he said.\n\n   Having a hands-free phone, Redelmeier said, ``might lull drivers\ninto a false sense of security and encourage them to make calls\nthey might otherwise have avoided.''\n\n   Corroborating Redelmeier's conclusion, other studies point out\nthat most accidents occur while drivers are in the middle of\nconversations, not while they are dialing or answering calls.\n\n   The increased risk persisted ``even among those drivers who'd\nowned a cell phone over many years,'' Redelmeier said. ``It's not\ninexperience, but perhaps a more fundamental limitation of driving\nperformance.''\n\n   Like others who have taken a hard look at cell phones in cars,\nRedelmeier was inspired by a personal experience. ``I was in my\noffice at the end of the day returning phone calls and caught up\nwith a patient on his cell phone,'' he recalled. ``We were talking\nand then he said, `I've got to stop talking _ I've just been in an\naccident.'''\n\n   No one was injured, Redelmeier said, but the incident started\nhim thinking about the role he may have played in the accident.\n``It certainly made me think about whether having a conversation\nwith his personal physician distracted him and caused the\naccident,'' he said. ``It brought new sting to the cliche of\n`physician, do no harm.'''\n\n   Findings like Redelmeier's have received widespread attention\nbut have had little effect on legislation so far.\n\n   In several states, bills have been introduced, then have\nfizzled. Mike Pugh, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol,\nsaid the cellular communications industry was too strong in his\nstate for such legislation to win approval. And legislators are\nalso enamored of the technology, Pugh pointed out. ``They'll be in\nthe same room, on their phones, talking to each other from across\nthe room,'' he said.\n\n   New York state has legislation pending to address the problem.\nAssemblyman Felix Ortiz, a Democrat from Brooklyn, is the sponsor\nof several bills related to cell phones being considered in Albany.\nHe said he had introduced his legislation after witnessing an\naccident involving a cell phone. ``It is completely seriously\ndangerous to drive and talk at the same time,'' he said.\n\n   nn\n\n   But officials at the Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation, the industry's main lobbying arm, see no reason to\nsingle out cell phones as a safety hazard. ``Everything in the car\nis a distraction,'' said the association's president, Tom Wheeler.\nWheeler said it was more important to educate drivers on using cell\nphones safely, just as they learn other aspects of safe driving.\n\n   ``You have to make a judgment that no, you're not going to push\ndown on that accelerator and make it through the yellow light, or\ndecide this is not the right time to have some sort of heated\nconversation on a cell phone or dial the phone,'' he said.\n\n   Association officials pointed out that the Toronto study had\nbeen criticized because even though it used cell phone records to\ncorrelate accident times with calls, it was unclear whether the\ncalls had been made immediately before or after the accidents.\n\n   Experts on the use of cell phones by drivers say studies will be\nmore reliable if accident reports are changed to include a specific\nplace for a police officer to indicate whether a mobile phone was a\nfactor in a crash.\n\n   ``Our recommendation is that all the states change their\naccident reporting forms to include whether a cell phone may have\nbeen in use or even the cause of the accident,'' said Burris, of\nthe University of South Florida. ``That way we'd have nationwide\ndata to use in the coming years so that legislation can be based on\nsound accident analysis.''\n\n   Because more detailed information is needed, a spokesman for the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration said, the agency is\npreparing to conduct its own research on cell phones and other\ndistractions for drivers. ``I'm not sure we could ever legislate\nattentiveness to driving,'' said the agency's administrator, Dr.\nRicardo Martinez. ``But when you put things into vehicles, you\nshould focus on how you design it.''\n\n   Martinez said he was concerned about what he called the emerging\ne-car. ``Cars are becoming mobile computers, with GPS and weather\ninformation and voice-activated e-mail,'' he said, making a\nreference to the Global Positioning Satellite system. ``All these\nthings are more and more going to affect a driver's mental\ndistraction.
