Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Last year, when Greta Carl, a 55-year-old lawyer in\nChicago, was told by her doctor that she was nearly 100 percent\nclean from her bout with ovarian cancer, she grew her hair to her\nshoulders for the first time in her life, and dyed her gray hair\nGoldilocks blond. ``I love it,'' she said. ``It's flattering. It's\nsexier. It's a way of shouting, `Hey, I'm alive!'''\n\n   For Ms. Carl, releasing her inner blonde was an act of\nfearlessness. ``I've always been the kind of person who wouldn't\nwant to be noticed,'' she said. Chemotherapy had left her bald. ``I\nhad a bloated, fat face, no eyebrows and eyelashes, and people\nwould not recognize me,'' she recalled. ``So, I bought my Shirley\nMacLaine wig, short and red. That way I had an excuse for how my\nappearance had changed.''\n\n   When she got better, the hair grew back. Having tried red, she\nhad the courage to go blond. Men notice her more now than in her\ngray days; her boyfriend, she said, ``loves to see me playing with\nmy hair in the mirror.'' She added, ``Confronting a\nlife-threatening illness forces you to use parts of your spirit and\nyour brain that you've never used before.''\n\n   Cancer survivors often go through radical life changes. They\nswitch jobs, spouses and friends. And for many women, radical\nchanges in their appearance _ a new hair color, figure or wardrobe\n_ can also mark the transition. After radiation, chemotherapy or\nsurgery, beauty makeovers are often a form of therapy.\n\n   ``Vanity becomes a statement of survival, of living one's life\nin the moment,'' said Michael States, the clinical program director\nat the Santa Monica, Calif., chapter of the Wellness Community, a\nnational support group for cancer patients and their families.\n``It's regaining control.''\n\n   Dr. Eugene Thiessen, an oncologist who in 1976 founded Share:\nSelf-Help for Women With Breast or Ovarian Cancer, an organization\nin Manhattan, said he found that women who survive cancer often\nhave a new sense of urgency to look their best. ``Women come to\ngrips with the fact they are living one day at a time,'' he said.\n``And they don't put off doing things that might enhance them _ a\nmakeover, hair, makeup, clothing. Whatever they feel is\nnecessary.''\n\n   That was certainly true for Peri Wolfman, an owner of the\nWolfman-Gold and Good Company home-furnishings store in SoHo. Ten\nyears ago, she had double mastectomies (and breast reconstruction),\nabout the same time that her youngest son left home for college.\nHer hair, rapidly turning white, was cut short and severe.\n\n   She wanted to remake her image from head to toe. Before her\nillness, Ms. Wolfman had exercised only occasionally. ``I hate\nflab,'' she said, ``and I wanted to make myself toned.'' She\nstarted going to the gym and, with a personal trainer, lost 10\npounds. She let her hair grow so that it tumbled in wavy tendrils.\n``It's tousled, messier hair,'' said Ms. Wolfman, who also dyed it\nwith black streaks, inspired by her new black-and-white Tibetan\nterrier puppies.\n\n   Just as Ms. Wolfman got in touch with a softer (although\ntrimmer) side, Ann Fonfa went in the opposite direction. After\nbreast cancer, Ms. Fonfa, the outreach coordinator at Share, forged\na look to match a tougher new self-image. Every inch of her _ short\nhair, bare tank top, tattoos _ tells the story. For Ms. Fonfa, 50,\nfashion is a form of autobiography. The tank top doesn't hide her\ntwo mastectomies. (Her size 34D breasts are gone.) Before she got\nsick, she had shielded her chest demurely in tailored suits and\nblouses buttoned to her throat. She had long, full, wavy hair.\nAfter chemotherapy, she kept her hair in a crew cut, giving her the\nlook of a middle-aged punk rocker. The effect is that of a militant\nsurvivor.\n\n     \nnn\n\n   ``I didn't feel comfortable being around women with no hair, if\nI had a full head of hair,'' said Ms. Fonfa, who on her left arm\nwears a black elastic pressure sleeve, used by cancer patients to\nprevent swelling after their lymph nodes have been removed. A\ntattoo of a coral snake slithers down her shoulder. Beneath the\nscar on her right breast, she has five more tattoos _ of a gold\nring and four pink rings _ emblems of each cancer-free year. ``A\nlot of survivors have tattoos,'' Ms. Fonfa said, ``because they\ntattoo you when they radiate you. They're measuring where the\nradiation will be. I wanted to reclaim that.''\n\n   At first, Ms. Fonfa's look was an act of defiance, a way of\nexpressing her outrage about what she saw as a ``mutilated body.''\nBut her outlook changed one day last March when she was walking\ndown University Place, on her way back from the Union Square\nGreenmarket. ``I was wearing a leather jacket, a white spandex tank\ntop,'' she recalled, ``and a gay guy came by and said, `Great bod!'\n_ and that did it.'' She began to    like    her new look.\n\n   Kathy Rich, a senior editor at Allure magazine in Manhattan, had\na bone marrow transplant to treat her breast cancer. Afterward she\nwent to spas to ``thank my body for taking me through all that,''\nshe said. She went on a shopping spree for celebratory clothes.\n``I'd been wearing really baggy clothes, loose overblouses and\nleggings,'' said Ms. Rich, who is at work on a memoir, which\nincludes her battle with cancer, to be published next year by\nCrown.\n\n   ``After the transplant, I started wearing more tailored and\ntighter-fitting clothes _ body-hugging sweaters, shorter skirts,''\nshe said. ``There's a sense when you go through this that you're so\nsexless, and in every way, cancer takes away your gender.'' But the\nnew look was short-lived. ``I've returned to my original style,''\nshe said. ``There's a reason your original style    is    your style.\nIt's because it looks good on you.''\n\n   Some makeovers are health-related, said Dr. Deborah Axelrod, a\nsurgical oncologist who specializes in breast cancer at Beth Israel\nMedical Center. ``You don't want to be heavy, because obesity plays\nsome role in post-menopausal breast cancer,'' Dr. Axelrod said. She\nencourages her patients to practice yoga and to stretch and run,\nand she tells them, ``You're not a pariah, you're not an outcast.''\n\n   As for men, they seem to go in for far fewer post-cancer\nmakeovers than women; men change things like unsatisfying jobs more\nreadily than their looks.\n\n   ``Women have a sense that style reflects their lives, but men\ndon't have that,'' said Nick Ullett, 57, a survivor of\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an actor and an occasional commentator on\nNational Public Radio's ``All Things Considered.'' He identified\none external change that some men do make after cancer. ``Men who\ngo through radiation or chemotherapy lose their hair, and go around\nwith semishaven hair,'' he said. ``It's the remission crew cut.''\nHe sports one, himself.\n\n   Whether by men or women, a makeover doesn't have to be an\noverhaul.
