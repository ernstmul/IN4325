Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ After decades of denials, the government is\nconceding that workers who helped make nuclear weapons beginning at\nthe dawn of the atomic age were exposed to radiation and chemicals\nthat produced cancer and early death.\n\n   The new finding _ that radiation exposure led to\nhigher-than-normal rates of a wide range of cancers among workers\nat 14 nuclear weapons plants _ raises the prospect of compensation\nto them. Although officials cautioned that any decision on that was\na long way off, they said a package could total tens of millions of\ndollars for a group that might well include hundreds of families.\n\n   The new conclusion comes from the government's most\ncomprehensive review of studies of worker health and raw health\ndata. The review accepts the conclusion of many of those studies,\nsome of them done under contract for the government, that workers\nwere made sick by their exposure.\n\n   The finding goes far beyond an acknowledgment by the government\nlast July that one substance handled by weapons workers, beryllium,\nhad caused some of them to become ill from breathing beryllium\ndust.\n\n   Of the new conclusion, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in\nan interview, ``This is the first time that the government is\nacknowledging that people got cancer from radiation exposure in the\nplants.''\n\n   The finding is detailed in a draft report prepared by officials\nof the Energy Department and the White House with the cooperation\nof a dozen government agencies.\n\n   President Clinton ordered the study in July, when the Energy\nDepartment concluded that some of the workers at plants that had\nsupplied beryllium to the government for bomb-making had developed\nberyllium disease, an incurable lung ailment. The president asked\nfor a broad study that would include the effects of radiation and\nchemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and other substances.\n\n   He also asked the group to develop a policy on compensation, but\nthat work has not been completed.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Legislation proposed by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., whose\nconstituents include some of the beryllium disease patients, calls\nfor payments to an estimated 500 to 1,000 former workers who either\nhave the illness or are at high risk of developing it. Total\npayments in the beryllium cases could range from $15 million to $30\nmillion a year, officials said.\n\n   One question that Congress would have to resolve in the\nberyllium compensation, and that would have to be addressed in any\ncompensation plan developed as a result of the cancer finding, is\nwhether to make payments to survivors.\n\n   In the 57 years since the Manhattan Project began processing\nradioactive materials to produce bombs, the government has until\nnow minimized the hazards of radiation and chemicals, criticized\nepidemiological studies that raised related questions and spent\ntens of millions of dollars in defending itself against lawsuits\ncharging that the bomb plants had made workers sick.\n\n   ``In the past, the role of government was to take a hike,''\nRichardson said, ``and I think that was wrong.''\n\n   One expert on nuclear weapons manufacturing, Robert Alvarez, a\nformer Energy Department official, welcomed the government's\nconclusion that many of its critics had been correct.\n\n   ``A review of the studies by a body impaneled by the president\nis official recognition,'' Alvarez said. ``That's what makes this a\nbig deal.''\n\n   Daniel J. Guttman, a lawyer for the Paper, Allied-Industrial\nChemical and Energy Workers Union, which represents workers at 11\nweapons factories, said of the draft conclusions, ``That's\nstunning.''\n\n   ``The prior story line is, `What's the big deal, the risks were\nmarginal,' '' said Guttman, former executive director of a\ncommission formed by the Clinton administration to look into\nimproper radiation experiments using human subjects.\n\n   Richard D. Miller, a policy analyst with the union, said the\nchange was remarkable because the Energy Department and its\npredecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, had ``spared no\nresources in seeking to defeat claims'' by employees who said they\nhad been made sick by radiation or chemicals.\n\n   Richardson addressed a related issue last July, describing the\nproblem of workers employed by private companies that had processed\nberyllium for weapons use. They could rarely collect worker's\ncompensation, a program geared to injury rather than illness, and\nin any event their symptoms or diseases frequently did not emerge\nuntil years after their employment ended. Also, he said, the\ncontractors who ran the factories for the government argued that\nthe link to the workplace could not be demonstrated.\n\n   Richardson said then that the government should pay for workers\nmade sick by beryllium, a toxic metal, and that radiation and\nchemical exposures should be studied. That statement led to\nPresident Clinton's request for the task force report.\n\n   At one site that figured in the report's draft, K-25, a\nnow-shuttered Tennessee factory for enriching uranium, Mike Church,\nthe president of the Energy Workers' local, said, ``It would be a\nstart in the right direction, trying to get help for these people,\nthat the government is finally stepping forward.''\n\n   The industrial process used at the plant exposed workers to\nradiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and\nfluorine. The union says workers at the plant have higher than\nexpected rates of leukemia, cancer of the lung and bladder, vision\nproblems and chronic fatigue syndrome, among other health problems.\nThe draft report, though, says only that workers there show more\nlung cancer than the population at large. The study does not list\nanother plant that used the same industrial process, at Paducah,\nKy., where workers recently learned that their exposure included\nplutonium as well as uranium.\n\n   nn\n\n   The government has the names of workers and former employees who\ndied from cancer or other causes. Researchers using government\nrecords have calculated the expected rates of various fatal cancers\nfrom such groups. In some cases these rates are drawn from\nepidemiological studies of general populations, in other cases they\nare drawn from studies of workers in the weapons complex who have\nbeen exposed to lower amounts of radiation.\n\n   Among 14 plants, according to the draft report, a total of 22\ncategories of cancer, ranging from bone to bladder to leukemia,\noccurred more often than expected.     \n\n   The cancers listed in the report, most of them fatal, are\npresumed to be caused by radiation and chemicals, although the\nreport does not address the precise scientific mechanisms and does\nnot clearly divide between chemicals and radiation in some cases.\n\n   It also leaves open the question of how to compensate people who\nworked in the complex and suffered illnesses now found at elevated\nlevels among their co-workers but which may not all be\noccupationally related. It also raises the prospect that workers\nwill get sick in years to come from past exposures. Among the other\nproblems, acknowledged by officials at the Energy Department, is\nthat records of radiation doses and other exposures are poor at\nmany sites.\n\n   The cancers were found among nearly 600,000 people who have\nworked in nuclear weapons production since the start of World War\nII. They range from leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma to cancer of\nthe prostate, kidney, salivary gland and lung.\n\n   In addition to several other operations at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,\nwhere K-25 operated, the draft also says that elevated cancer\nlevels were found at Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford,\nin eastern Washington state, where plutonium was manufactured;\nRocky Flats, near Denver, where the plutonium was shaped into\nweapons components, the Fernald Feed Materials Center, near\nCincinnati, where uranium was processed, and at the Lawrence\nLivermore and Los Alamos national laboratories.\n\n   Some of the findings are drawn from epidemiological studies\nperformed from the mid-1960s onward, some of them disavowed by the\ngovernment at the time they were published. Others are from data\ngathered by the Energy Department, which now owns the plants, its\npredecessor the Atomic Energy Commission, or their contractors.\nNone of the research was done specifically for this study, which is\ndue to be finished in March.\n\n   The report does not sum up the cancers, but a senior government\nofficial familiar with its contents and preparation, said in an\ninterview that ``my guess, we could be talking about hundreds of\ncases, in a population of hundreds of thousands.''\n\n   But Alvarez said that the number of victims would depend on how\nmany diseases are linked to radiation; if, as some epidemiologists\nbelieve, radiation damages the human immune system and thus leaves\npeople vulnerable to a wide variety of diseases beyond those\ncancers usually associated with radiation, then the number could\nrise to the thousands.\n\n   The draft, however, explicitly states that the scientific\nquestions of causation were outside the task force's mandate.\n","Headline":"\nU.S. ADMITS RADIATION PERIL TO WORKERS\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ After decades of denials, the government is\nconceding that workers who helped make nuclear weapons beginning at\nthe dawn of the atomic age were exposed to radiation and chemicals\nthat produced cancer and early death.\n","\n   The new finding _ that radiation exposure led to\nhigher-than-normal rates of a wide range of cancers among workers\nat 14 nuclear weapons plants _ raises the prospect of compensation\nto them.
