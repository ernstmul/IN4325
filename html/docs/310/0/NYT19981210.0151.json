But the risks of surgery are also\nsignificant. A study suggests that many asymptomatic brain\naneurysms _ especially smaller ones _ have a low risk of rupture,\nand doing nothing may be best.\n\n   A report in The New England Journal of Medicine on a sample of\n2,621 patients in the United States, Canada, and Europe concludes\nthat the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits in some people who\nhave brain aneurysms less than 10 millimeters (a bit less than half\nan inch) in diameter. For those who have had previous bleeding in\nthe brain, the risk of another aneurysm bursting is higher and may\nbe a reason for preventive surgery, said the investigators, led by\nDr. David O. Wiebers at the Mayo Clinic.\n\n   More and more aneurysms are being found incidentally during\nbrain scans, and are posing dilemmas, said Dr. John Marler, a\nneurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and\nStroke, who supervised the trial.\n\n   The findings, he said in an interview, ``will come as a\ntremendous relief to patients and physicians advising them''\nbecause they provide more information on which to base a decision.\n\n     \n  \n\n     Lead effects seen to saddle children\n\n        \n  \n\n   Cognitive deficits caused by environmental lead in early\nchildhood are largely irreversible, with children failing to\nimprove very much even when the exposure to lead is reduced,\naccording to a study from Australia.\n\n   The authors of a report in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation said children in families living near a lead smelter in\nPort Pirie, South Australia, have been tested for lead in their\nblood and monitored for cognitive performance beginning in 1979. In\ngeneral, the lead levels in children's blood declined substantially\nafter age 2, though some children still had high levels at 11 to\n13, said the researchers from the Queensland University of\nTechnology in Brisbane.\n\n   The cognitive scores of children who had the biggest drop in\nlead exposure were only slightly better than those of children\nwhose blood lead concentration declined the least, said the\nauthors, suggesting the cognitive damage was largely irreversible.\n\n   The findings, the authors wrote, make it ``increasingly\nimportant'' to reduce exposure to lead from an early age.\n\n     \n  \n\n     Tumor-starving drug to be tested\n\n        \n  \n\n   The National Cancer Institute has agreed to test a drug made\nfrom shark cartilage that starves tumors of their blood supply, and\nwhich is considered an alternative or complementary treatment.\n\n   The drug, known as AE-941/Neovastat, will be given in\ncombination with radiation and chemotherapy to more than 250\npatients with inoperable lung cancer, said Dr. James Pluda, a\nresearch official at the institute, in an interview.\n\n   The drug is made by Aeterna Laboratories Inc. of Sainte-Foy,\nQuebec, and has previously been tested in animals and in patients\nwith cancer in advanced stages.\n\n   Pluda said that part of the funding for the trial comes from the\nNational Institutes of Health's Center for Alternative Medicine.\nThe hope, he said, is that the drug _ one of a promising category\nof agents called angiogenesis inhibitors because they block blood\nvessel growth _ will work in combination with conventional\ntreatments to prolong patients' survival.\n","Headline":"\n_BRAIN DATA ECHOES `FIRST DO NO HARM'   \n _LEAD EFFECTS SEEN TO SADDLE CHILDREN   \n _TUMOR-STARVING DRUG TO BE TESTED  \n","Text":["\n     Brain data echoes `first do no harm'\n","\n        \n  \n","\n   A cerebral aneurysm, sometimes called a ``time bomb in the\nbrain,'' presents one of the most difficult medical questions:\nwhether to operate before it ruptures or to leave it alone.\n","\n   When aneurysms, or the ballooning of weak spots in blood\nvessels, rupture suddenly, they are often fatal or severely\ndamaging to the brain.
