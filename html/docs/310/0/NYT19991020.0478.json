Times News Service   \n\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal District judge ruled Wednesday that the\nuse of secret evidence of alleged terrorist connections to detain\nimmigrants violated the due-process protections of the\nConstitution.\n\n   In a strongly worded decision, the first in the nation to find\nsuch use of secret evidence unconstitutional, Judge William H.\nWalls ordered the immediate release of Hany Kiareldeen, 31, a\nPalestinian who has been held for 18 months in a New Jersey county\njail while immigration officials have sought to deport him.\n\n   But lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service\nquickly obtained a stay from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,\nwhich agreed to hear an appeal of the release order on Thursday.\n\n   That meant that Kiareldeen would remain in the Hudson County\nCorrectional Center for at least another day, said Regis Fernandez,\none of his lawyers.\n\n   ``But we will get him out,'' he said.\n\n   Despite the delay, the judge's ruling delighted Kiareldeen's\nlawyers and other national advocates for detained immigrants, who\nsaid it made it clear that resident aliens have the same rights to\ndue process that citizens have.\n\n   They also said the ruling would help the cases of about 20 other\npeople of Arab descent whom the immigration service is holding on\nthe basis of classified information from undisclosed sources.\n\n   All are considered to have connections to terrorist groups, and\nare therefore deemed threats to national security, according to the\nsketchy summaries of the secret evidence against them.\n\n   In Kiareldeen's case, the summaries of the classified FBI\nreports refer to sources linking him to one of the men convicted in\nthe 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n\n   In his 35-page decision, Walls wrote ominously of ``government\nprocesses initiated and prosecuted in darkness,'' and said the case\nraised ``serious issues about the integrity of the adversarial\nprocess.'' He also took the unusual step of ordering the\nimmigration agency to pay Kiareldeen's lawyers' fees.\n\n   ``This is as strong an opinion as we could have ever hoped\nfor,'' said David Cole, a volunteer lawyer with the Center for\nConstitutional Rights, a Manhattan nonprofit legal services agency.\nAn expert on secret evidence, he has been one of Kiareldeen's\nlawyers.\n\n   William Strasberg, a spokesman for the immigration service, said\nthe agency had sought to prevent Kiareldeen's release Wednesday\nbecause it continues to believe that Kiareldeen is a ``terrorist\nthreat.'' He declined to give any details of the legal basis of the\nagency's appeal of the release order, and added that it was\nconsidering whether to appeal the decision itself.\n\n   Walls' ruling came just five days after administrative law\njudges on the Board of Immigration Appeals, in another rebuke to\nthe government's use of secret evidence in the case, upheld an\nimmigration court judge's April ruling that Kiareldeen should not\nbe deported and that he was entitled to a green card, which grants\nlegal residence in the United States.\n\n   That ruling had not led to his release because the immigration\nagency obtained a stay while it decided whether to appeal the\ndecision to Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\n   In a related ruling late Wednesday, a Board of Immigration\nAppeals panel ordered that Kiareldeen be released on $1,500 bond.\nThat ruling, like the earlier immigration court rulings, does not\ntake precedence over the federal court actions, said Fernandez, but\nit serves to bolster his argument that his client is not connected\nto terrorists.\n\n   Kiareldeen, who came to the United States nine years ago on a\nstudent visa, had maintained throughout his hearings before the\nimmigration judges that the allegations against him were the work\nof a vindictive former wife who was born in Egypt. He had been\nremarried to an American citizen and was applying for a green card\nwhen he was taken into custody by immigration authorities in March\n1998 for having an expired student visa.\n\n   It was only then that he learned that the government had\nevidence that it would not disclose.
