The people\nat the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.\nSo, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the\noffspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even\nsegregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many\nroads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'\nwork. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled\nnine of them.\n\n   The story is embargoed until Sunday, Sept. 10, but will move by\nFriday evening. PHOTOS have moved to NYT.\n\n   Stories include:\n\n   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a\ntypical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police\nshootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was\nconstantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the\nneighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black\nPanther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about\ngrowing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where\nstudents read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this\nswashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a\nchild it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about\ngrowing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights\nmovement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,\noften dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of\nthe movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent\nactivists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The\nChildren of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.\nSome continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to\nforget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.\n(Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS\n\n   WITH THE FOLLOWING PROFILES:\n\n   _ Ericka Brown-Abram _ Daughter of Black Panther Elaine Brown.\n\n   _ Albert Vivian _ Son of Rev.

This summer, there was open water at the North Pole.\nFrom the Andes to the Alps, mountain glaciers are retreating. And\nacross North America, from the fire-scorched West to the\ndrought-parched Southeast, the last year of the millenium has given\nmillions a summer of discontent. As the signs of a warmer world\ngrow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways\nto prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one\nof the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20\nyears ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to\nimplement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under\nthe proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong\nvillains in the global greenhouse mystery.

The people\nat the center of the struggle led dramatic, often dangerous, lives.\nSo, too, did their kids. The children of the movement _ the\noffspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even\nsegregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many\nroads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'\nwork. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled\nnine of them.\n","\n   The story is embargoed until Sunday, Sept. 10, but will move by\nFriday evening. PHOTOS have moved to NYT.\n","\n   Stories include:\n","\n   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a\ntypical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police\nshootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was\nconstantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the\nneighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black\nPanther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about\ngrowing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where\nstudents read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this\nswashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a\nchild it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about\ngrowing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights\nmovement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,\noften dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of\nthe movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent\nactivists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The\nChildren of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.\nSome continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to\nforget their childhood. Here are the stories of eight of them.\n(Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS\n","\n   WITH THE FOLLOWING PROFILES:\n","\n   _ Ericka Brown-Abram _ Daughter of Black Panther Elaine Brown.\n","\n   _ Albert Vivian _ Son of Rev.

As the signs of a warmer world\ngrow more apparent, there are some nagging new questions about ways\nto prevent it. A new analysis by NASA physicist James Hansen, one\nof the first scientists to sound the alarm over global warming 20\nyears ago, suggests that industrialized nations struggling to\nimplement a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions called for under\nthe proposed 1997 Kyoto Protocol, may be pursuing the wrong\nvillains in the global greenhouse mystery.
