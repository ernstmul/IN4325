BIERSDORFER   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Sorting Out All Those Ports On the Back of the Computer  \n\n   Q: I see where the mouse and keyboard are plugged in, but can\nyou explain what the different ports on the back of a computer are\nfor? Are they different between PCs and Macintoshes?\n\n   A: Yes, there are some differences, although the Universal\nSerial Bus, or USB, is closing the gap between the two hardware\ntypes. The types of ports may vary from machine to machine, but\nhere are some general types and purposes.\n\n   The standard PC ports, which have been around for a while, are\nthe parallel and serial ports. The parallel port is most commonly\nused to attach the computer to a printer, and it has a wide, 25-pin\nconnector on the end of the cable.\n\n   The serial port, which usually has a smaller, 9-pin connector\n(although serial ports can also have 25-pin connectors), can be\nused to plug in several different kinds of devices, like modems,\nmice and joysticks.\n\n   To free the serial port for other uses, though, most computers\nhave a PS/2 port, which has a round, 6-pin connector. Most\ncomputers made in the past few years also have at least two\nrectangular USB ports as well.\n\n   USB is now the most common way to connect devices to iMacs and\nnewer Macintosh models as well. Older Macs will have a SCSI port\n(pronounced ``scuzzy'' and sometimes used on PCs as well) on the\nback; it is a wide, 25-pin connector that serves as the parallel\ninterface for Macs. For attaching the keyboard, older Macs also had\na round, five-pin Apple Desktop Bus, or ADB, port, and personal\nprinters and modems were usually connected through either of the\nMac's round 9-pin serial ports.\n\n   Q: What exactly does the term cellular mean in regard to phones?\nAre all portable phones cell phones?\n\n   A: Cellular phones were named that because they use a series of\ncells, or transmission sites, that are spread out to cover each\nservice area. Early cellular phones transmitted low-power analog\nradio signals on an 800-megahertz frequency. (Analog refers to the\nprocess of sending an audio signal in a continuous wave.)\n\n   Analog cellular networks, which are much older than the digital\nnetworks that are currently gaining ground, also offer wider\ncoverage.\n\n   Although any type of mobile telephone is often referred to as a\ncell phone, some people differentiate between phones that use the\nold analog cellular networks and ones that don't. Phones that don't\nare often just referred to as wireless.\n\n   Phones labeled as wireless usually use digital signals to send\nand receive calls. Digital phones also have their own type of\nnetworks, which were built after the old analog networks. Unlike\nanalog phones, which send a continuous sound wave, digital phones\nwork by sampling just parts of the sound wave and then transmitting\npieces of data quickly in bursts.\n\n   Digital networks may not cover as much territory as analog ones,\nbut they boast (in theory) better sound and clearer, more secure\nsignals that are harder to decode by people who may be listening in\non phone calls. (You should note that no type of cellular or\nwireless phone call is completely secure from eavesdroppers.)\n\n   Roaming _ making calls outside the normal coverage area offered\nby your service provider's calling plan _ is often easier on an\nanalog network because of the wider coverage area. A dual-band\nmobile telephone can work with either system.  \n\n   Most large metropolitan areas are covered by digital networks\nalready, and the networks are continuing to expand. If you have a\nquestion about coverage in your area, most wireless service\nproviders offer network maps and coverage options right on their\nWeb sites.  \n\n   Many PCS phones (Personal Communications Services) are based on\ndigital technology and usually operate on a frequency of 1900\nmegahertz. Because of the faster speeds that a digital network can\nprovide for transmitting data, digital phone networks are able to\nhandle such mobile treats as wireless Internet services.\n\n   Nextel is another type of digital wireless phone technology that\ncan combine telephone functions with two-way radio capability.   \n  \n\n   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by\nmail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd\nStreet, New York, N.Y. 10036-3959 or by e-mail to\nQandA(at)nytimes.com.\n","Headline":"\nSORTING OUT ALL THOSE PORTS ON THE BACK OF THE COMPUTER \n","Text":["\n   Sorting Out All Those Ports On the Back of the Computer  \n","\n   Q: I see where the mouse and keyboard are plugged in, but can\nyou explain what the different ports on the back of a computer are\nfor?
