It is supposed to be used as an\nadjunct with an abnormal chest X-ray or CT scan,'' said Dr.\nFlorence Houn, director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation III.\n\n   Patients are injected with a teaspoon-size amount of the drug\nwhich floats through the body searching for basket-shaped receptors\nfound atop proteins that are produced by many types of lung\ncancers. A common nuclear-medicine camera then feeds the image to a\ncomputer screen or an X-ray-like film where the image of the lung\nlights up to show where cancer cells or located. If there are no\ncancer cells, the drug flows through the body.\n\n   Richard T. Dean, president and CEO of Diatide Inc., said that it\nworks with the X-rays and CT scans to if suspicious masses that\nappear could be cancerous tumors or maybe just scar tissue.\n\n   `This takes the technology to the next level. X-rays can tell if\nthere is an abnormal mass in the body, but it can't tell what it\nis. It could be a tumor, a blood clot or a golf ball. With NeoTect,\nif it is a cancer, it will light up and if it is not malignant the\npatient doesn't have to go through invasive procedures like surgery\nand biopsies.''\n\n   Dean said that in addition to detecting cancer cells, NeoTect\ncan also help doctors determine if there are other areas that have\ncancer cells and it can be used as a follow-up procedure with\ncancer patients to see if treatments are working effectively or if\ncancer has spread.\n\n   That is where Dr. Bruce Johnson, Director of Lowe Center For\nThoracicOncology at Dana Farber Cancer Institute said that the drug\ncould potentially be the most helpful.\n\n   The drug could help cut down on the amount of tests cancer\npatients need to determine whether it has spread outside of the\nlung, Johnson said.\n\n   ``We usually do a number of tests to make sure that it hasn't\nspread outside of the lung by doing a CT scan to image the liver,\nbrain, bone scan...about three If you do the test and pick\nsomething up, you could do it in one test,'' Johnsons said. Houn\nsaid that ``We (FDA) think it's an important new diagnostic tool.''\n\n   In fact, the Diatide Inc. had its application put through a\n``priority review'' by the FDA, a fast-tracking approval approach\ndone for only about 10 to 20 percent of drugs.\n\n   Houn said that it is commonly done with drugs that could be of\nsignificant benefit to life threatening diseases.\n\n   Lung cancer is the number one cancer in women and men in the\nUnited States. More than 170,000 have been diagnosed with the\ndisease. Biopsies in which lung tissue is surgically removed allows\ndoctors to diagnose the cancer.\n\n   Houn said the help that it can help patients and doctors make\ndecisions.\n\n   ``If you are wondering, `Could this be cancer or something\nbenign, this test can help,'' ' Houn said. ``If you are not sure if\nit is a scar, this can help when you are stuck.''\n\n   In active NASDAQ trading Diatide stock fell 5/8, to 6 1/8 with\nmore than 253,000 shares _ more than three times its average daily\nvolume _ changing hands.\n","Headline":"\nDRUG THAT IDENTIFIES CANCER CELLS IN LUNGS OK'D \n","Text":["\n   A new drug made by a New Hampshire company that lights up cancer\ncells could help doctors determine if patients with suspicious\nchest X-rays need a biopsy for lung cancer.\n","\n   NeoTect, made by Londonderry-based Diatide Inc., was approved\nWednesday by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n","\n   ``It doesn't replace biopsy.
