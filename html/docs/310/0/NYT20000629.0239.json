On TV, the khaki-shorted Steve Irwin pokes at\nman-eating reptiles and crawls under houses looking for deadly\nsnakes. In his latest travelogue, the tweedy, bearded Bryson visits\na secondhand bookstore and picks up a volume about crocodile\nattacks and tells us the horrifying tale of an American model who\nwas standing under a waterfall in western Australia when she\nnoticed a half-submerged snout swimming toward her. She was last\nseen being dragged beneath the surface, a startled look on her\nface. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)BOOKS-REVIEW-GENDER\n_ Only a Nixon could go to China. Only a Clinton could criticize\nSister Souljah. And only a Stephanie Gutman, a civilian and\n(obviously) woman journalist with liberal credentials from The New\nYork Times and The New Republic, could write a book suggesting that\nthe presence of women in the U.S. military might hinder the\nnation's ability to win wars. (Furnish, Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution)\n\n   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Larry Woiwode's ``What I Think I Did'' is neither\nautobiography nor fiction but rather a memoir in the form of\nmeditation, with past and present changing into one another like\nthe colors of a chameleon. One act describes Woiwode and his family\ntrapped in a blizzard during the winter of 1996-97, the other his\nlife as a young man in New York when he hung around with an\naspiring teenage actor named Robert DeNiro and caught the eye of\nWilliam Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is\noften hypnotic in its imagery (``... a wind hits and streaks of\nsnow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a\nwhite-out.''), the other a recollection of another life and another\nworld entirely. Of DeNiro he writes: ``When he's unhappy his\nparents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly angry, as if the\nresponsibility he takes for keeping in touch with them, in order to\nkeep in touch, identifies him as their cause for being apart. An\nonly child's trial.''

(Warmbold, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.\n\n   BOOK-REVIEW-TS _ From the first days of the Colonies, the United\nStates has been something like a mutt in search of its pedigree.\nNothing illustrates the point more clearly than our poetry. What's\nmore American: W.S. Merwin's ``The River of Bees'' or Langston\nHughes' ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,\nconvinced that it has something to do with time. Some countries, we\ntell ourselves, have thousands of years of tradition. But, in fact,\ntradition starts from zero, and what many of us miss is that we're\nin the process of creating a uniquely American voice. (Martinez,\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution)\n\n   FASHION\n\n   FLOPPY-HATS _ Everywhere you look this summer, people are\nshading their eyes and heads with floppy, flip-brimmed caps that\nresemble buckets.

A legend in its own\nmind, a hotdiggedy, superbad boy on a wet bun, it's the scion of\n66-year-old Lieutenant Stevens, who, in case you haven't heard, is\nthe once and future soda-fountain king of Columbus. But put another\nway, it's just a weiner on a bun, smothered with chili, topped with\npickles, chopped onions, cubes of American cheese and oyster\ncrackers, eaten with a spoon. (Brock/Langhenry, Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution). 15. WITH PHOTOS.\n","\n   ARMLESS LANDSCAPER _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Even among people who\nhave never met him, Marty Ravellette is unforgettable. Past the\ninitial shock, it is amazing to watch the 60-year-old landscaper as\nhe earns a living, without arms. Ravellette, the owner of Hands on\nLandscaping, once tore down houses in Oregon with a hammer and a\ncrowbar. In another job, he drove a truck across the Rocky\nMountains.

On TV, the khaki-shorted Steve Irwin pokes at\nman-eating reptiles and crawls under houses looking for deadly\nsnakes.

She was last\nseen being dragged beneath the surface, a startled look on her\nface. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)BOOKS-REVIEW-GENDER\n_ Only a Nixon could go to China.

(Furnish, Atlanta\nJournal-Constitution)\n","\n   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Larry Woiwode's ``What I Think I Did'' is neither\nautobiography nor fiction but rather a memoir in the form of\nmeditation, with past and present changing into one another like\nthe colors of a chameleon. One act describes Woiwode and his family\ntrapped in a blizzard during the winter of 1996-97, the other his\nlife as a young man in New York when he hung around with an\naspiring teenage actor named Robert DeNiro and caught the eye of\nWilliam Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is\noften hypnotic in its imagery (``... a wind hits and streaks of\nsnow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a\nwhite-out.''), the other a recollection of another life and another\nworld entirely. Of DeNiro he writes: ``When he's unhappy his\nparents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly angry, as if the\nresponsibility he takes for keeping in touch with them, in order to\nkeep in touch, identifies him as their cause for being apart. An\nonly child's trial.''

What's\nmore American: W.S. Merwin's ``The River of Bees'' or Langston\nHughes' ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,\nconvinced that it has something to do with time. Some countries, we\ntell ourselves, have thousands of years of tradition. But, in fact,\ntradition starts from zero, and what many of us miss is that we're\nin the process of creating a uniquely American voice.
