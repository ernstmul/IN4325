(jw) \n By PAUL ZIELBAUER   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It took a quarter-century for the police to\nmake an arrest in the killing of Martha Moxley, the 15-year-old\nGreenwich girl bludgeoned to death with a golf club on the evening\nof Oct. 30, 1975.\n\n   But as lawyers prepare for a Tuesday hearing for Michael Skakel,\narrested at age 39 in a murder prosecutors say he committed as a\n15-year-old, the question is whether those 25 years produced enough\nevidence for a conviction.\n\n   There is no guarantee that the case will ever be tried before a\njury; Skakel has been charged as a juvenile, and a judge must\ndecide whether he should be tried as an adult.\n\n   But if State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict succeeds in getting\nthe trial moved to State Superior Court, he will depend on a mix of\nphysical and circumstantial evidence, incriminating statements and\nsome physical evidence not yet publicly revealed.\n\n   The evidence includes:\n\n   -- Two sections of a bloodied 6-iron golf club, part of a set\nowned by the Skakel family, that the killer used to beat and later\nstab Moxley to death. One segment of the club, the handle, was\nnever found.\n\n   -- Sworn testimony from former neighbors and acquaintances of\nSkakel. Several former classmates from a school for troubled youths\nthat Skakel attended more than 20 years ago have told a Connecticut\ngrand jury that they heard Skakel admit killing Moxley. Neighbors\nof Skakel testified that he told them he had had a sexual\nrelationship with Moxley before her death, according to a retired\nGreenwich detective.\n\n   -- A confidential report from 1995 in which Skakel and his\nbrother Thomas, himself a former suspect in the murder,\nsignificantly changed the accounts they gave to Greenwich\ndetectives in 1975 about where they were when the killing was\nthought to have occurred.\n\n   -- Nine hours of audiotapes subpoenaed from a writer who helped\nMichael Skakel create a 38-page memoir over the last few years in\nwhich he professes romantic feelings for Moxley, according to\npeople who have read a transcript of the tapes.\n\n   Benedict also has physical evidence that is not yet known to the\npublic. In a recent interview, Henry Lee, director of the\nConnecticut State Police and an authority on forensic crime\ninvestigations, said he had ``some forensic evidence'' from the\ncrime, though he provided no details.\n\n   And late last month, a person in law enforcement with detailed\nknowledge of the investigation said prosecutors had other physical\nevidence against Skakel.\n\n   The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the\nundisclosed evidence was not DNA, and on its own would probably not\nbe enough to convict Skakel.\n\n   Though much of the prosecution's case is circumstantial, some\ntrial lawyers say it combines physical evidence tying Skakel to the\ncrime; a motive, jealousy; and a changed alibi that undercuts\nSkakel's credibility.\n\n   Skakel, who now lives in Florida with his wife, child and\nfather, has consistently maintained his innocence and has declined\nto discuss the case. Interviews with legal experts drew a wide\nrange of views about the evidence.\n\n   ``I don't think they can prove this case beyond a reasonable\ndoubt; they don't have the evidence,'' said Alan M. Dershowitz, a\nlaw professor at Harvard and a well-known defense lawyer.\n\n   But Elliot Peters, a former federal prosecutor in New York,\nnoting the origin of the 6-iron used to bludgeon Moxley, disagreed.\n\n   ``Whoever killed this girl was in this guy's house or\nbackyard,'' Peters said in a recent interview. The fact that the\nmurder occurred in Belle Haven, an exclusive and private\nneighborhood in Greenwich where the Moxleys and Skakels lived,\n``limits the universe of people who could have done it to a very\nsmall number.''\n\n   The blood-flecked golf club, which the police believe was\ndeliberately broken into three segments by the killer, who used one\npiece to repeatedly stab Moxley _ is perhaps the most concrete but\nnot the most powerful evidence in Benedict's arsenal, legal experts\nsaid.\n\n   With no fingerprints or other definitive forensic evidence,\nexperts said, the two fragments are not sufficient to incriminate\nSkakel or the two other men who have also been viewed as suspects _\nThomas Skakel, now 41, and Kenneth Littleton, who arrived in the\nSkakel household as a 23-year-old live-in tutor the day Moxley was\nkilled.\n\n   The most incriminating evidence Benedict is expected to bring\nagainst Michael Skakel, aside from any new physical evidence, is\nthe sworn testimony from Skakel's former classmates, according to\nseveral lawyers familiar with the case. Those statements, given to\na grand jury convened 20 months ago, contend that Skakel confessed\nto killing Moxley, said people who have spoken to these classmates.\n\n   Skakel, who attended a school for youths with alcohol and\nbehavioral problems from 1978 to 1980, has denied ever confessing.\n\n   Other sworn statements from former neighbors describe a romantic\nlink between Skakel and Moxley, said Stephen X. Carroll, a retired\nGreenwich detective who investigated the Moxley murder.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Using grand jury testimony and accounts from friends that Moxley\nhad often flirted with Skakel's brother Thomas, prosecutors may try\nto prove that Michael Skakel killed her in a jealous rage, legal\nscholars said.\n\n   Investigators say they have little doubt that Moxley knew her\nkiller. Still, many defense lawyers said a case based largely on\ncircumstantial evidence would not be strong enough to win a\nconviction, especially after so much time has passed. ``It seems to\nfall short of a precise pinpointing of who did it and how it was\ndone,'' Dershowitz said.\n\n   Other lawyers, particularly experienced prosecutors, described\nthe case against Skakel as difficult but winnable.\n\n   ``Cases based on circumstantial evidence can be as powerful as\ncases based on physical evidence,'' said Joan McPhee, a former\nfederal prosecutor in New York who is now in private practice in\nProvidence, R.I. ``The strength of the case turns on how many\ninterlocking pieces of evidence the prosecutor has.''\n\n   If the case goes before a jury, the job of Mickey Sherman,\nSkakel's lawyer, will be to hammer away at the details prosecutors\nare said not to know about the murder. He would be expected, for\ninstance, to focus on uncertainties about the precise time of\ndeath, which the Greenwich police estimated to be 10 p.m. (others\nhave put it at an hour or more later), and on the lack of witnesses\nwho could place Skakel at the murder scene at that time.\n\n   In his original statement to the police in 1975, Skakel said he\nwas at the nearby home of his cousin James C. Terrien at 10 that\nnight watching television with his brothers Rushton Jr. and John\nand with Terrien. Terrien's sister Georgeann corroborated this\naccount. Skakel went on to say that he arrived home after 11 p.m.\nand went to bed, though an edited copy of the Greenwich police file\non the murder shows that no witnesses substantiated that portion of\nhis account.\n\n   But a 1995 report by investigators hired by Skakel's father,\nportions of which were obtained by The New York Times, reveals that\nSkakel, at age 35, changed his account.\n\n   After returning home, according to the 1995 report, he sneaked\nout of his bedroom window around 11:30 p.m. and walked to the\nMoxley home, where he climbed a tree and tossed pebbles at Moxley's\nwindow. When she did not respond, Skakel said, he masturbated in\nthe tree and began to walk home. As he approached the area where\nMoxley's body was later discovered, he told investigators, he heard\na noise, threw something in its direction and ran home.\n\n   Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective who wrote\na book about the Moxley murder suggesting that Skakel was the\nkiller, called the revised story ``a well-crafted attempt to\naccount for everything'' prosecutors might have found at the murder\nscene, including his hair and semen, and to explain his presence if\nany witnesses had seen him running from the scene. Fuhrman said he\nbelieved that the murder occurred closer to 11:30 p.m.\n\n   But if prosecutors want to link Skakel to Moxley's death,\nSherman said, ``it's incumbent on them to change the time of death.\nFor many years the state has known that he has a very solid alibi\nfor where he was at the time of the murder.''\n\n   Moxley's autopsy, conducted a day after her body was found,\nestimated the time of death to be between 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 30,\n1975, and 5 the next morning. Beyond the fuzzy timing of the\nkilling, Sherman would be likely to challenge the use of\ndepositions from Skakel's former classmates as inadmissible, said\nDante Gallucci, a criminal defense lawyer in Fairfield, Conn.\n\n   ``Without those admissions, their case gets a hell of a lot\nweaker,'' Gallucci said. ``They're almost back to 1975 and they got\nnothing.'' The fact that nearly 25 years have passed since the\nmurder would probably also help Sherman create reasonable doubt in\na juror's mind, Gallucci said.\n\n   The absence of physical evidence has hounded the Moxley\ninvestigators from the beginning. For many years, Michael Skakel\nwas not considered a suspect.\n\n   Suspicions fell first on his brother Thomas and then on\nLittleton. Thomas, the last person seen with Moxley, originally\ntold the police that he had left her at 9:30 p.m. the night of the\nmurder and had returned home to write a school paper on Abraham\nLincoln. The police, however, could not find any teacher who had\nassigned him such work.\n\n   In the 1995 investigative report commissioned by his father,\nThomas Skakel also changed his story about his movements that\nnight, saying he had left Moxley about 9:50 p.m., not 9:30 p.m.,\nafter the teen-agers had masturbated together near the area where\nher body was later found.\n\n   The revised account would have put Thomas, 17 at the time, in\nMoxley's company only about 10 minutes before the time the police\nestimate she was killed. It would also account for any semen\nsamples that Lee, the state's forensic investigator, might have\nfound when he reconstructed the killing in 1991.\n\n   Thomas Skakel's attorney, Emanuel Margolis, said his client was\nno longer a suspect.\n\n   The only other suspect investigated by the police was the\nSkakels' former tutor, Littleton, an athletic man who, some say,\nwas the only person near the crime scene physically able to have\nbeaten Moxley so forcefully.\n\n   Questioned continually over the years, Littleton has struggled\nwith drug and emotional problems since 1975 and in 1976 was found\nto be untruthful on major questions about the murder in polygraph\ntests, according to the police file on the Moxley case. He was\ngranted immunity in exchange for his grand jury deposition in 1998\nand is no longer a suspect, investigators say.\n\n   A friend of Michael Skakel's, someone who has heard Skakel\ndiscuss the events of Oct. 30, 1975, time and again, said he was\ninnocent.\n\n   ``They have the wrong person,'' said the friend, speaking on the\ncondition of anonymity.\n\n   ``He didn't do it. If he had done something like this,'' the\nfriend went on, describing Skakel as garrulous to a fault, ``he'd\ntalk about it. He couldn't help himself.''\n","Headline":"\nMOXLEY MURDER CASE IS A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CHALLENGE FOR PROSECUTORS\n","Text":["\n   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It took a quarter-century for the police to\nmake an arrest in the killing of Martha Moxley, the 15-year-old\nGreenwich girl bludgeoned to death with a golf club on the evening\nof Oct. 30, 1975.\n","\n   But as lawyers prepare for a Tuesday hearing for Michael Skakel,\narrested at age 39 in a murder prosecutors say he committed as a\n15-year-old, the question is whether those 25 years produced enough\nevidence for a conviction.\n","\n   There is no guarantee that the case will ever be tried before a\njury; Skakel has been charged as a juvenile, and a judge must\ndecide whether he should be tried as an adult.\n","\n   But if State's Attorney Jonathan C.
