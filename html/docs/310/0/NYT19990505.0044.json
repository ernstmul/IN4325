Melanoma, the deadliest\nskin cancer, has been the most susceptible to cancer vaccines, but\nthe trial will include a variety of other cancers.\n\n   Cancer vaccines enhance the immune system not to prevent a\ndisease, as do most vaccines, but to attack a tumor that already\nexists. While the immune system is designed to destroy any cells\nthat don't belong in the body, it does not recognize cancer cells\nas interlopers, which enables tumors to grow.\n\n   ``Because each patient's malignancy is genetically unique, it is\nour hope that this cancer vaccine will teach the body's immune\nsystem to attack the cancer cells,'' Finley said.\n\n   Each part of his vaccine has been used with some success\nindependently. Finley and other scientists suspect the combination\nwill be more effective.\n\n   Melanoma and colon cancer cells have been destroyed by using\nvaccines with inactive cells from the same tumor, coated with a\nsubstance the immune system can recognize, called a hapten. That\nprocess helps the immune system identify the tumor as foreign to\nthe body.\n\n   Dendritic white blood cells, which Finley called the body's best\ncells for activating the immune system, have been used in treating\nkidney and prostate cancer cells, as well as melanoma.\n\n   ``By pre-exposing those cells to the tumor cells, the hope is it\nwill develop a more robust reaction to the cancer,'' said Dr.\nStuart Merl, Franciscan's medical director for oncology.\n\n   It is rare for community hospitals to conduct Phase I cancer\ntrials, designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of a\ntreatment before it is compared with existing therapies. But Finley\nbegan working on cancer vaccines in 1995 with scientists at Hipple\nCancer Research Center and conducted a small trial of five terminal\nmelanoma patients, two of whom survived.\n\n   ``I went right back to work at my own real estate business and I\nplay golf twice a week,'' said Wally Sweetwater, now 73, who\ncompleted the vaccine protocol in November 1995. ``We carry our own\nbags and walk 18 holes at Miami Valley. I would not be here today\nwithout Dr. Finley.''\n\n   CANCER VACCINE TRIALS\n\n   What: Clinical trial of two-part cancer vaccine using cells from\nthe patient's own tumor and blood.\n\n   Who: Cancer patients with advanced breast, colo-rectal, gastric,\nhepato cellular, nero-endocrine, non-small-cell lung, ovarian,\npancreatic, head and neck carcinomas as well as melanoma and\nsarcoma skin cancers, may be eligible to be treated on this\nprotocol.
