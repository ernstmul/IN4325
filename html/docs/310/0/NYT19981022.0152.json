She felt like an outsider when members spoke of losing\ntheir breasts and how their husbands or boyfriends reacted. She\nhated having to explain her sexuality, instead of having her\nillness explained to her.\n\n   With characteristic verve, Doucher set out to learn as much\npossible about her disease. She found that, far from being an\naffliction only of straight women, breast cancer is thought to be a\ngreater problem for lesbians.\n\n   She also found that healing would take much more than doctors\nand pills.\n\n   Cancer doctors have long suspected that lesbian women are at\ngreater risk for breast cancer, from anecdotal evidence that they\ntend to be heavier, undergo cancer screenings only sporadically and\nhave children late or not at all.\n\n   But no one had tested this hypothesis until September, when\nresearchers completed the first study to compare breast cancer risk\nfactors of lesbian and heterosexual women. The study, which\ninvolved 1,019 women from 1995 to 1997, concluded that lesbians\nindeed have higher weight-height ratios and fewer pregnancies.\n\n   ``It's still too early for us to develop specific mammography\nguidelines for lesbians, but our study shows the importance of\nencouraging lesbians to seek medical care on a regular basis,''\nsaid Dr. Stephanie Roberts, medical director at Lyon-Martin Women's\nHealth Services in San Francisco, where the study was conducted.\n\n   Doctors recommend a mammogram every year for women after turning\n40. Regardless of sexual activity, women 18 and older should have\nannual gynecological and clinical breast exams conducted by a\ndoctor.\n\n   But many lesbians visit a gynecologist rarely or never, thinking\nthe annual exams are for women at risk of getting pregnant or\ncatching a sexually transmitted disease from a male partner.\n\n   ``Many lesbians report that it's been over three years since\nthey had their last Pap smear,'' said Dr. Jocelyn White of the Gay\nand Lesbian Medical Association, a national organization with 2,000\nmembers.\n\n   The Pap smear, which shows cervical abnormalities, and other\nregular tests can detect cancer in its earliest stages, when it is\neasier to treat. Finding cancer at a later stage generally means a\npoorer chance for survival.\n\n   Another breast cancer risk factor is not having children, or\nhaving them at a later age, as many lesbians do. Being pregnant has\nhealth benefits: During pregnancy, the body's levels of the female\nhormone estrogen drop.\n\n   ``Many cancers, specifically breast cancer, are\nestrogen-dependent,'' said Linda McGehee, (cq) a close friend of\nDoucher's and a faculty member at Georgia State University's\nnursing school. ``Lesbians who choose not to have children, or have\nthem later in life, have more exposure to estrogen.''\n\n   Getting lesbians into doctor's offices may take more than\nconvincing them they should go.\n\n   Health care costs are a major barrier. Lesbians generally can't\njoin spousal health insurance plans, and women typically earn less\nmoney than men. Annual gynecological exams cost $125 to $175, and\nmammograms can add $100 or more.\n\n   Also, many lesbians fear discrimination and poor treatment if\nthey reveal their sexual status.\n\n   Bev Baker, executive director of the Mary-Helen Mautner Project\nfor Lesbians With Cancer in Washington, has heard some appalling\ntales.\n\n   ``Lesbians have been abused in the health care system,'' Baker\nbluntly said. ``Once their health care providers find out they're\nlesbians, many women have been left flat on their backs, feet in\nthe stirrups.''\n\n   In interviewing lesbians with cancer about their health care\nexperiences, McGehee found that women felt either very good or very\nbad about how their doctors treated them and their partners.\nSometimes the patient's partner was ignored; in other cases, the\ndoctor made special efforts to talk to the partner and educate her\nabout her loved one's illness.\n\n   ``The medical community needs to address these issues,'' White\nsaid. ``Until physicians can work effectively with lesbians, they\nwon't be able to work with all patients.''\n\n   Physicians also need more information, specifically about the\nincidence of breast cancer among lesbians. Only further studies can\ndetermine this statistic, because current tracking methods such as\nthe National Tumor Registry don't differentiate by sexual\norientation.\n\n   The San Francisco study found that lesbians are more than twice\nas likely as heterosexual women to require breast biopsies\nperformed on lumps, to determine whether they are cancerous.\n\n   Surprisingly, the study didn't find that lesbians were more\nlikely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than straight women _ but\nthe overall average age of the women in the study was 43. The risk\nof breast cancer increases with age, with 77 percent of new\ndiagnoses occurring among women 50 and older, according to the\nAmerican Cancer Society.\n\n   The lead researchers themselves say their study had significant\nlimitations.\n\n   ``Future study needs to be done that gets at different economic\ngroups, different geographic areas,'' Roberts said.\n\n   Roberts and her research team will soon begin a three-year study\nof 5,000 lesbian and heterosexual women, funded by California's\nBreast Cancer Research Program. The study will target women older\nthan 40.\n\n   Lesbian health specialists are anxiously awaiting a report on\nlesbian health research priorities by the Institute of Medicine, a\npart of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, expected in\nNovember, will address the extent of knowledge of rates of cancer,\nSTDs, hypertension and substance abuse among lesbians.\n\n   ``That report is very likely to shape how we look at lesbians'\nhealth over the next decade or two,'' White said.\n\n   Doucher couldn't wait for more research; she needed help and\nanswers immediately. Luckily, she had extraordinary initiative and\nenormous support, from her family and friends.\n\n   But she strongly felt that other lesbians with cancer shouldn't\nhave to struggle to get support and information.\n\n   ``She felt she had had to go through it alone at first,'' said\nfriend Jill Ruhlman. ``She didn't want anyone else to have to go\nthrough that.''\n\n   So Doucher conceived a support group for lesbians with cancer\nand their partners. Co-founded with McGehee and another friend,\nSherry Hale, the Atlanta Lesbian Cancer Initiative began holding\nweekly support groups meetings in October 1996.\n\n   A year later, Doucher was among five national breast cancer\nactivists, including entertainer Rosie O'Donnell, who were\nrecognized for their work by the National Breast Cancer Coalition.\n\n   Now more than 2 years old, the Atlanta initiative is thriving.\nIn addition to the support group, it holds a series of monthly\nworkshops on grief and bereavement.\n\n   Two weeks ago, it published the metro area's first lesbian-,\ngay- and bisexual-friendly physician list.\n\n   ``The physician list goes beyond the scope of AIDS and cancer\nand will hopefully help people in our community make choices about\nhealth care providers,'' said McGehee, the organization's executive\ndirector.\n\n   The group also recently presented its first community award: the\nDennie Doucher Healing Angel Award, to Dr. Janice Galleshaw, a\nmetro oncologist.\n\n   Despite removal of her right breast in 1992, Doucher's cancer\nrefused to go away.\n\n   The second time it appeared, it attacked her bones. Doucher\nunderwent chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. She tried\nalternative treatments, including a macrobiotic diet and Chinese\nherbs. The third time, cancer struck her brain. She underwent\nradiation.\n\n   In the fall of 1997, cancer reappeared in her brain and spread\nto her liver. On Feb. 12, she died, at age 46 _ by all accounts a\nsoul at rest, a healed spirit.\n\n   ``Even some lesbians ask me why we need a separate support\ngroup,'' McGehee said, wryly. ``It's because lesbians don't need to\nface potential negative reactions when they're going through a\nlife-threatening illness.\n\n   ``All their energy needs to go toward healing.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Dennie Doucher was so comfortable as a lesbian, it was\nunthinkable that she would feel uneasy about telling others she was\n(cq she's deceased) gay.\n","\n   But many unthinkable things happen when you have cancer.\n","\n   In 1992, when Doucher was diagnosed with breast cancer, the\nnative Atlantan was thrust into a culture that identifies breast\ncancer with heterosexual women.\n","\n   Support groups, normally nurturing, put Doucher on the\ndefensive.
