The result is a crazy quilt of\nfrequency bands reserved for a variety of civilian and military\napplications, like conventional AM and FM radio, television, ham\nradio, mobile phones, aircraft and ship communications, and\nnavigation systems. Some frequency bands are left unused to avoid\ninterfering with radio astronomy and other scientific efforts.\n\n   The International Telecommunication Union, a U   .   N   .\n   organization that is the intergovernmental rule-making body for\nthe radio spectrum, used to review how radio frequencies were used\nevery 20 years. Since 1992, though, it has stepped up its reviews\nto every two years to keep up with the demand.\n\n   In the United States, the agencies responsible for managing the\nspectrum have never been busier. They are the National\nTelecommunications and Information Administration, which handles\nthe parts of the spectrum reserved for the government's use, and\nthe Federal Communications Commission, which keeps watch over\nprivate use.\n\n   ``As you make more of the spectrum available, more people want\nto use it,'' said Norbert Schroeder, a program manager in the\noffice of spectrum management at the national telecommunications\nagency. Decisions about how to use the spectrum hinge on practical\nquestions _ what it is possible to do _ as well as on public\npolicy, international regulations and economics, Schroeder said.\n\n   Technology has come to play a crucial role. ``It is only because\nof the developing technologies that the spectrum has become\navailable at the higher frequencies,'' Schroeder explained.\n\n   But tapping into ever-higher frequencies has its own problems.\nThe signals at higher frequencies are more easily obstructed by\nbuildings and other structures. To use these frequencies, which\nstart around three gigahertz and are mostly in the microwave part\nof the spectrum, it is necessary to use relays to strengthen and\nretransmit the signals or to build very big antennas. Both\nsolutions are expensive, Schroeder said.\n\n   Dale Hatfield, director of the Federal Communications\nCommission's office of engineering and technology, said an\nalternative approach was to use the lower frequencies more\nefficiently.\n\n   Here, too, technology can help. Digital systems are making it\npossible to compress signals, reducing the width of the frequency\nbands needed for some transmissions.\n\n   For example, the frequency bands allocated for two-way radios\nfor taxis and the police used to be 50 kilohertz wide. Now they are\n12 kilohertz, and technology is becoming available that could\nreduce them further, to 6 kilohertz.\n\n   Still, there are trade-offs. ``With the smaller bands, you lose\ntransmission power,'' Schroeder said. ``But system design can\novercome these problems by using relays or repeaters that\nrebroadcast the signals.''\n\n   Sharing frequencies is another way to manage the demand. The\nradio broadcasts of the Voice of America, for example, share\nfrequency bands that are used by the military for training.\n\n   Reallocating what is already in use is a possibility. The part\nof the spectrum used for UHF (ultrahigh frequency) television\nchannels 60 to 69 ranges from 746 to 806 megahertz. That band is\nnot in use in some parts of the country, so part of that chunk of\nthe spectrum in those areas is being sold at auction to companies\nthat want to provide wireless Internet communications for personal\ndigital assistants, cell phones and personal computers. Other parts\nare being reassigned by the Federal Communications Commission for\nuse by the police and other public safety agencies.\n\n   Even with changes and technological developments, spectrum\nmanagement remains difficult. One strain on the system is\nunlicensed use. The spectrum from 902 to 928 megahertz, for\nexample, is occupied by signals that do not need to be licensed,\nlike those coming from cordless phones and keyless security systems\nfor doors.\n\n   ``People a lot of times are using radio spectrum without\nrealizing it,'' Hatfield said.\n\n   And equipment that makes no use of radio frequencies can also\ncause interference. ``The spectrum is a natural resource that can\nbe polluted,'' Hatfield said. ``A person turning on a hair dryer\ncan cause snow on the TV next door.''\n","Headline":"\nWIRELESS DEVICES ARE CROWDING THE AIRWAVES \n","Text":["\n        It is a growing, although invisible problem.\n","\n   In the past decade, an explosion in the number of wireless\ndevices _ cellular telephones, satellite television dishes and\npagers, to name just a few _ has led to crowded airwaves.\n","\n   So far, the range of radio frequencies, which lie between\naudible sound and infrared radiation on the electromagnetic\nspectrum, has been able to accommodate all the increased uses.\n","\n   More and more, though, ensuring that different devices can be\nused without interference from others is a high-wire act achieved\nonly through technological advances and the careful management of\nthe radio spectrum.\n","\n   Different uses are allotted different portions of the usable\nspectrum, from relatively low frequencies (measured in thousands of\nhertz, or kilohertz) to high-frequency microwaves (measured in\nbillions of hertz, or gigahertz).
