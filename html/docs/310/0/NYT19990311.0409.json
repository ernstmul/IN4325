BRODER   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ President Clinton vigorously denied on\nThursday that the administration had minimized evidence of nuclear\nspying by China and defended his policy of engagement with Beijing\nas the only effective means of restraining Chinese behavior.\n\n   Clinton said that he was under no illusions about China's covert\nefforts to acquire American nuclear weapons technology. He said\nthat when he received persuasive evidence that highly classified\ndata about American nuclear weapons design had been leaked from the\nDepartment of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, he acted\naggressively to contain the damage and prevent further incidents.\n\n   ``We did not ignore evidence. Quite the contrary, we acted on\nit,'' the president said at a news conference at the conclusion of\na summit meeting with Central American leaders. ``I believe the\nrecord is clear that we did respond in an appropriate way.''\n\n   Clinton's comments on Thursday were his first public statements\nsince reports emerged over the weekend that a Chinese-American\nscientist at Los Alamos might have been responsible for providing\ninformation in the 1980s that enabled China to develop a\nminiaturized nuclear warhead similar to the most sophisticated\nweapons in the American arsenal.\n\n   Congress has opened an investigation of the case, including\nallegations that the administration sought to play down the\nseverity of the suspected espionage and delay the investigation so\nas not to jeopardize its policy of reconciliation with Beijing.\n\n   On Capitol Hill on Thursday, Republicans toned down their fiery\ncriticisms of the administration's handling of the Los Alamos spy\ncase, perhaps sensing that undue hysteria was creeping into their\nresponse.\n\n   Speaker Dennis Hastert echoed Clinton's call to remain engaged\nwith Beijing. ``The more we're involved with China, the better off\nwe are _ for us and for China and the Pacific area,'' Hastert said\nin an interview. ``It's also important that we stress our views on\nhuman rights. If we aren't engaged, we can't do that.''\n\n   Clinton said that he did not become aware of the potential scope\nof the technology transfer until July 1997, when he was briefed on\na continuing FBI inquiry into a case of possible espionage at the\nEnergy Department laboratories.\n\n   The initial investigation produced evidence not only of a hugely\ndamaging transfer of American nuclear technology, but of systemic\nleakage of military secrets from the facilities.\n\n   ``At that time, we moved quickly and decisively,'' Clinton said,\n``not only with the continuing FBI investigation and a CIA review,\nbut also with an intense review of the counterintelligence\ncapacities of our Energy Department labs.''\n\n   But American officials have said that the federal government's\ndrawn-out effort to track down the possible leak was plagued by\ndelays, inaction and skepticism _ even though senior intelligence\nofficials considered it one of the most damaging spy cases in\nrecent history. For instance, a recommendation by the FBI in April\n1997 that background checks be reinstated on visitors to Los Alamos\nwas ignored for 17 months by the Energy Department.\n\n   Now, nearly three years later, no arrests have been made. A\nprime suspect in the case, a Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory, was fired on Monday after three days of\nquestioning.\n\n   The president said that beginning in early 1998 he had\nsignificantly tightened security at the weapons facilities,\nincluding requiring polygraph examinations for employees with\naccess to critical information.\n\n   And he asserted that the intelligence committees of Congress\nhave received 16 briefings on the matter since 1997, despite angry\ncomplaints from members that the administration kept them largely\nin the dark about the alleged spying.\n\n   He also rejected calls from some Republican presidential\nhopefuls that he dismiss Sandy Berger, the national security\nadviser, whom some have accused of foot-dragging in the spy case in\norder to protect and justify his support for a policy of close\ncooperation with Beijing.\n\n   ``I think Mr. Berger acted appropriately and therefore I would\nnot release him or ask for his resignation. I just don't think\nthere's any evidence to support that,'' the president said.\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)\n\n   Sen. Craig Thomas, a conservative Republican from Wyoming who\nheads the Foreign Relations subcommittee for Asia, dismissed as\n``premature'' the demands for Berger's resignation. ``I've never\nsupported the idea that every time China does something we don't\nlike we ought to submit a thing to the Senate and get after them,''\nThomas told reporters.\n\n   Clinton met twice with Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, in\nthe fall of 1997 and the summer of 1998, after Clinton learned of\nthe espionage charges but months before they became public. The\npresident plans to meet with the Chinese prime minister, Zhu\nRongji, in Washington in April.\n\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)\n\n   Clinton said that despite this case and other evidence of\nChinese acquisition of weapons-related technology from the United\nStates, it was in America's interest to remain engaged with the\nAsian giant.\n\n   He said that his policy of ``strategic partnership'' with China\nhad already brought benefits, including China's signing of the\nChemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n   He also praised Beijing's cooperation with the United States for\nprogress in non-proliferation programs aimed at Iran, Pakistan and\nNorth Korea. China has also played a constructive role in limiting\nthe damage from the Asian economic crisis of the past 18 months,\nClinton said.\n\n   ``I would argue that our efforts to have an honest and open\npolicy with China, so that they don't think that we have made a\ndecision in advance to try to contain and limit them in their\neconomic growth and their development as a nation, has paid\ndividends,'' the president said.\n\n   ``I do not believe those things would have occurred if we had\nnot had an open, candid, honest relationship with China, aware of\nall the facts,'' he added.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The president pointedly noted that the alleged transfer of\nweapons technology to China occurred in the mid-1980s, when China\nmade rapid strides in its own nuclear program that were detected by\nU.S. intelligence agencies. At the time, there was no clear\nevidence that Chinese technological leaps were the result of theft\nof American weapons secrets.\n\n   But even if the current espionage case proves that Chinese spies\npilfered American weapons design, Clinton said, there remain\nreasons to continue to work with Beijing.\n\n   ``I do not believe that the evidence justifies an isolated\nno-contact relationship with China,'' he said, ``when we have\ngotten the benefits not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the\nworld, of our engagement policy.''\n","Headline":"\nPRESIDENT DENIES IGNORING EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR SPYING \n","Text":["\n   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ President Clinton vigorously denied on\nThursday that the administration had minimized evidence of nuclear\nspying by China and defended his policy of engagement with Beijing\nas the only effective means of restraining Chinese behavior.\n","\n   Clinton said that he was under no illusions about China's covert\nefforts to acquire American nuclear weapons technology.
