Herald-Tribune   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   The paper said that June was the hottest month on record, but\nwhat I want to know is why.\n\n   After all, if June was the hottest month on record, there is no\nreason why July won't be hotter still and August even hotter than\nthat, until, by September, we're all baked down to carbon-based\nlife forms the size of charcoal briquettes.\n\n   And if everybody is reduced to glowing lumps of coal, we will\nnot be able to take advantage of our upcoming ``tax holiday,''\nbrought to us courtesy of the Florida Legislature (motto: No Stunt\nToo Stupid If It Gets Us Re-elected), whereby we can save up to\n$3.50 on the purchase of our next bowling shirt, but not our next\npair of bowling shoes, or perhaps it's the other way around. I'm\nnot sure. (Zippers will be taxed but belts will not, but what use\nis a tax-free belt to someone who's a charcoal briquette?)\n\n   So, you see, it's imperative that we find out why June was the\nhottest month on record and correct the problem by mid-August so we\ncan all drive across town to the mall on congested, potholed\nstreets, past the overcrowded schools and under-funded police\ndepartment, in order to avoid paying the tax on a $50 fur coat.\n(Don't tell the clerk you're going to wear your $50 fur coat as a\nHalloween costume because then you'll have to pay sales tax.)\n\n   I've been trying to think if there was anything I did,\npersonally, to cause June's record heat wave. I know that if my car\nhas been sitting in the sun all day and I open the door, a blast of\nsuper-heated air smacks me in the face like solar wind, singing my\nnose hairs and fusing the frames of my glasses onto my temples. If\neverybody in Florida opened their car doors at the same time, I\nexpect the polar ice cap would melt and people in Iowa would find\nthemselves owning beachfront property.\n\n   But I opened my car door no differently this June than I did in\nJunes past, so I can't see how this could account for the record\nheat.\n\n   It is possible, but not likely, that the tearing down of\nRingling Towers caused the heat wave. Demolishing an historic\nlandmark generates a lot of civic angst, but, to my knowledge, it\nhas not been scientifically proven that civic angst affects the\ndaytime highs or causes any other sort of climatic changes that\nwould lead to record-setting heat.\n\n   Rampant cell phone use could have nudged the thermometer up a\ndegree or two, but, again, the scientific basis for this claim is\ndubious at best. However, cell phone users can be irritating, like\nwhen you're waiting in line at the convenience store to buy a\nlottery ticket and some clown in front of you is calling his\ngirlfriend to find out if she wants the regular Slim Jims or the\nspicy.\n\n   But what part cell-phone-related irritation played in last\nmonth's heat wave is a matter of conjecture, and, to tell the\ntruth, it is probably no greater an influence than the irritation\ncaused by the U.S. soccer team, talk radio or Jerry Springer.\n\n   (Would it be constitutionally permissible to outlaw the\nMcLaughlin Group if it was found that feuding pundits contributed\nto global warming?)\n\n   If push came to shove (and let's hope it doesn't in this heat)\nand I had to choose the one thing that was most responsible for\nlast month's miserable weather, it would be sport utility vehicles.\nNot only do they spew out more heat-trapping emissions than other\ncars, the people who drive them own a disproportionate number of\ncell phones.\n\n   It all adds up to record heat, with no relief in sight.\n\n   (David Grimes is a columnist for the Sarasota (Fla.)\nHerald-Tribune.)\n","Headline":"\nTRYING TO AVOID MELTDOWN \n","Text":["\n   The paper said that June was the hottest month on record, but\nwhat I want to know is why.\n","\n   After all, if June was the hottest month on record, there is no\nreason why July won't be hotter still and August even hotter than\nthat, until, by September, we're all baked down to carbon-based\nlife forms the size of charcoal briquettes.\n","\n   And if everybody is reduced to glowing lumps of coal, we will\nnot be able to take advantage of our upcoming ``tax holiday,''\nbrought to us courtesy of the Florida Legislature (motto: No Stunt\nToo Stupid If It Gets Us Re-elected), whereby we can save up to\n$3.50 on the purchase of our next bowling shirt, but not our next\npair of bowling shoes, or perhaps it's the other way around.
