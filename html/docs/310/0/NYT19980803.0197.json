He shined a light in the infant's eyes\nand pronounced her perfectly healthy.\n\n   But, with the doggedness of a mother convinced something was not\nright, Drummond insisted on a more thorough examination. This time\nthe doctor sat Amy in a darkened room so her pupils would dilate,\nthen took another look.\n\n   ``He looked inside her eye and saw the tumor,'' Drummond said.\n``If I had trusted my doctor the first time, it would have been a\nhorrible thing.''\n\n   Horrible indeed.\n\n   Worldwide, about 8,000 children a year are diagnosed with\nretinoblastoma in one or both eyes, said Dr. A. Linn Murphree,\ndirector of the Ocular Oncology Service at both Childrens Hospital\nLos Angeles and University of Southern California School of\nMedicine, and one of about 20 eye surgeons worldwide who treat\nchildren with this condition. About 7,000 of those diagnosed die by\nage 2, most of them in Third World countries, where they are never\ntreated because of lack of medical facilities or money.\n\n   But as serious as this cancer is, few people had ever heard of\nit until two Los Angeles-area soap opera stars _ Hunter Tylo of\n``The Bold and the Beautiful'' and Matthew Ashford, formerly of\n``General Hospital'' _ announced recently that they had children\nborn with the condition.\n\n   Tylo's daughter, 6-month-old Katya, has had her right eye\nremoved; chemotherapy continues to try to save her left eye, in\nwhich five more tumors were found. Ashford's 1-year-old daughter,\nEmma, is undergoing chemotherapy that has shrunk tumors in both her\neyes.\n\n   Murphree, the only surgeon in the Southwest region of the United\nStates who treats large numbers of retinoblastoma patients, calls\nthe eye cancer an ``orphan disease'' because it is relatively rare\nwhen compared to other childhood diseases, so few major hospitals\nor universities have established centers to fight it.\n\n   But the doctor and some of his patients are trying to remedy\nthat with the proceeds from an Aug. 21 benefit that will honor TV\ntalk-show host Rosie O'Donnell for her work with children. The\nmoney raised will go to expand an eye-cancer research center at\nChildrens Hospital of Los Angeles.\n\n   Murphree, who was recognized as the nation's top surgeon in 1997\nby the American College of Surgeons, is also designing a system for\ndoctors around the world to share via the Internet information on\neye-cancer cases, including diagnosis and treatment.\n\n   He's also campaigning to persuade pediatricians nationwide to\ninclude dilated-pupil examinations as part of newborn and well-baby\ncheckups; it's the only way to diagnose and treat retinoblastoma\nwhile children's lives and sight can be saved.\n\n   Checking a baby's eyes is a simple, inexpensive procedure _ the\nonly cost is a $30 bottle of eye drops that should last a\npediatrician for a month and a half _ but many doctors are\nerroneously convinced that it would be too complicated and\ntime-consuming to dilate the eyes of every baby they see at least\nonce, Murphree said.\n\n   ``You can see why they feel that way when you realize that most\npediatricians will see a tumor like this only once in a 30-year\ncareer,'' said Murphree.\n\n   But Murphree and researchers at Childrens Hospital, who have\npioneered eye-cancer treatment for the past dozen years, see 300 to\n400 young patients a year with retinoblastoma, a cancer that's\ncaused by a single missing gene on chromosome 13, one of the 23\npairs of chromosomes that make up the retina's 3 million cells.\n\n   ``It happens at the time of conception or maybe at the first\ncell division after that,'' Murphree said. ``(Tumors) tend to arise\nin cells that have not finished differentiating ... A child's\nretinas aren't formed completely until he's about 2{. The eyes grow\nand the retina grows. That means there is a window of risk until a\nchild is about 2{.''\n\n   Some cases of retinoblastoma are hereditary; others occur\nspontaneously, with no family history of the disease. Childrens\nHospital researchers, armed with $15 million in private grants,\nhave isolated and cloned the retinoblastoma gene. They're now\nworking on a way to replace the defective gene and on new\nchemotherapy methods.\n\n   When doctors look inside the eye of a child with retinoblastoma,\nthey see tumors that look like blobs of creamy white floating in\nthe eyeball's viscous interior. Of children diagnosed with\nretinoblastoma, 60 percent have tumors in only one eye. Forty\npercent have tumors in both eyes, and 25 percent of those children\nlose both eyes.\n\n   In 7,000 of the 8,000 children worldwide diagnosed with the\ndisease every year, the cancer spreads outside the eye, affecting\nthe brain. Those are the children who die.\n\n   Childrens Hospital doctors save more than 98 percent of the new\nretinoblastoma patients they see each year by administering doses\nof chemotherapy to shrink the tumors, then zapping the remaining\ntumor with a laser beam.\n\n   ``We don't always save the eye, but we usually save the\npatient,'' Murphree said.\n\n   For a parent, a diagnosis of retinoblastoma is a shock.\n\n   ``The idea of babies and cancer just doesn't mix,'' said\nAshford, whose daughter was diagnosed when she was just short of 4\nmonths old. He and his wife, Christina, thought Emma had a lazy\neye; their pediatrician referred them to a pediatric\nopthalmologist.\n\n   ``He took one look and said, `She has tumors in her eyes. ...\nThey're malignant; they're always malignant'.''\n\n   As devastated as the Ashfords were by the diagnosis, they were\nthankful to have caught the disease early.\n\n   ``Most of the time, they don't get children (diagnosed) until\nthey're 13, 15, 18 months old ... and by the time they come in, the\ntumors are just blossoming in their eyes. They have to take the\neyes out and try to save their lives.''\n\n   After Emma had begun undergoing chemotherapy, Ashford was\nlooking through photos taken of the family for their 1997 Christmas\ncards. And in Emma's eyes, he could see the telltale white pupils.\n\n   ``It was just the scariest thing. You realize you're looking at\ntumors.''\n\n   The Ashfords have joined with the Tylos and director Tim\nZinneman (``A Small Circle of Friends,'' 1980; ``Impulse,'' 1984)\nand his wife, who also have a child who was born with\nretinoblastoma, to organize the upcoming benefit.\n\n   ``Someday when Emma grows up, we'll be able to tell her,\n`Because you had this, many children will have sight and will\nlive','' Ashford said.\n\n   Learning that their child's life will likely be spared, parents\nheave a sigh of relief, Murphree said. But when they realize that\nto save that life, one or both eyes must be removed, a new wave of\npanic sets in: Their child will not only be blind, but will be\ndisfigured.\n\n   Murphree explains to frightened parents that the interior of\ntheir child's eye will be replaced by an inert plastic implant,\nwhich will be sewn in place permanently and covered by a thick\ncontact lens-like prosthesis with the color of the pupil matched to\nthat in the remaining eye. The lens, he tells them, will be\nreplaced as the child grows.\n\n   It's a difficult concept to grasp _ until parents meet with\nsecond-grader Amy Drummond. She whips off her glasses and goes\nnose-to-nose with kids and their parents.\n\n   ``I let them look at my eyes and see what their child is going\nto look like,'' Amy said. ``I've had lots of people look at my\neyes, and only one's been able to tell which one's mine and which\none's fake.''\n\n   Amy was 21 months old when she lost her eye; her prosthetic lens\nwas handpainted to match her left eye, which is a brownish green.\n\n   ``Sometimes I forget about it and I feel like I have two eyes,''\nsaid Amy, who attends ballet and gymnastics classes, swims and goes\nbike riding just like any other little girl. The only problems she\nexperiences are a lack of depth perception (that's resulted in her\novershooting the glass when pouring milk) and lack of peripheral\nvision on her right side.\n\n   ``There have been near-accidents on the playground because she\ncan't see people coming at her from that side,'' her mom said.\n\n   Fifteen-year-old Tyler Dumm of Carpinteria, who lost both eyes\nto retinoblastoma when he was 2{ and his right leg from the knee\ndown to bone cancer when he was 10, also offers pep talks.\n\n   ``Not being able to see doesn't bother me a whole lot,'' said\nTyler, who _ with the help of his friends as guides and lookouts _\nbodysurfs, boogie boards, skateboards, skis, rides horses, throws\nthe shot and the discus on the Carpinteria High School track team,\nand plays trumpet and keyboard in a band. In his honors classes,\nwhere he takes notes in Braille and on a special computer, a single\nB-plus marred his record of all A's this year.
