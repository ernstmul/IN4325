But they haven't known\nwhether these initial genetic changes continue to play a role over\ntime in helping tumor cells thrive. Now, they do.\n\n   Writing in the current Nature, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nresearchers have shown that a mutated form of the ras gene not only\ntriggers melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, but\nkeeps melanoma cells growing. It does this in part by stimulating\nvascular endothelial growth factors that cause blood vessels to\ngrow near tumors to supply them with nutrients.\n\n   Working with mice, molecular biologists Lynda Chin and Ronald\nDePinho found a way to turn ras on and off by altering the animals'\ndrinking water. When they turned it on (by adding a compound to the\nwater), the animals developed melanomas in two or three months.\nWhen the compound was withdrawn (in essence, when the genetic\n``switch'' was turned off), the tumors shrank.\n\n   That suggests that ras continues to pump out signals that keep\ncancer growing _ and that anti-ras drugs now under development\nmight be able to stop cancer growth.\n\n     \n   \n   Testing newborns' urine for cerebral palsy risk\n\n       \n\n   Taiwanese researchers writing in the current New England Journal\nof Medicine report that a urine test can help identify newborns at\nrisk for oxygen deprivation in the brain that can lead to cerebral\npalsy. CP is a relatively rare, but devastating neurological\ndisease that affects 3 of every 1,000 babies and can be triggered\nby oxygen deprivation during delivery.\n\n   For 130 years, doctors have tried to find better ways to spot\nthe newborns at highest risk, says Dr. Jeffrey M. Perlman , a\npediatrician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center\nin Dallas, who wrote an editorial accompanying the report. Babies\nwhose blood is acidic, who have sluggish heart rates and\nrespiration, or who need resuscitation seem to be at highest risk.\n\n   Testing the urine within six hours of birth for the ratio of two\nmetabolic products, lactate and creatinine, can help spot babies at\nhighest risk, the study indicates. Research is under way to see\nwhether moderately cooling high-risk babies to 94 degrees\nFahrenheit can minimize brain damage.\n\n     \n   \n   MGH researchers back regular mammograms\n\n       \n\n   Using a computer model based on tumor growth and spread,\nMassachusetts General Hospital researchers confirm what 20 years'\nworth of clinical trials show _ mammograms every one to three years\nreduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 30 percent. It also\nshows the importance of regular mammograms.\n\n   But the model goes further: It suggests that if women had\nmammograms every six months, they could reduce their risk of death\nfrom breast cancer by 80 percent.\n\n   The MGH team, writing in the August issue of Radiology, stops\nshort of recommending mammograms that often, but says this should\nbe tested.
