As I looked up, way up,\nI noted that the driver, cigarette dangling from her lips, was\notherwise occupied talking on her cellular phone. I sounded my horn\nto gain her attention, thus saving me from extensive auto repairs\nand, likely, a visit to the emergency room _ or worse.\n\n   I now know what I fear most: not the giant urban chariots\nthemselves but people in them (and other vehicles) who talk on cell\nphones.\n\n   Last week, a high school honors student who was skating on a\nbicycle path near my home was struck and killed by a car that\nveered off the road and came onto the parallel path. Reports say\nthe driver either was talking on her cell phone or had dropped it\nand was leaning to pick it up. Either way, she was distracted from\nher driving, lost control and someone died.\n\n   The case against using cell phones while operating a vehicle has\nbeen building for some time. Already, laws have been passed in\nseveral states to deal with it. Now, such a movement is under way\nin Florida; a direct result of the death of the young lady.\n\n   There are those who maintain that hands-free cell phones will\nremedy the problem, and there are those who insist that it will\nnot, that the real problem is the distraction of talking; of being\nattentive to something other than your driving.\n\n   Coincidentally, I came upon an old newspaper clipping the other\nday that would tend to agree with those who say it is the act of\ntalking on the phone, more than holding it, that poses the greatest\ndanger.\n\n   Back in 1956, there was a story in the Miami Herald that a local\nauto insurance agent would not write policies for people who had\nradios in their cars. He referred to accidents with which he was\nfamiliar that ``were the direct result of drivers' attention being\ndistracted because they were listening to ball games instead of\nconcentrating on driving safety.''\n\n   Was the agent overreacting? Probably. An All-State sales\nmanager, interviewed in the same article, said there was ``no\nevidence that the driver of a car which carries a radio is either\nworse or better than the driver of an automobile not so equipped.''\n\n   Yet, I can recall quite a few times when I was listening to the\nauto radio _ ball game, talk show, news _ and lost my concentration\non the road. In fact, even today, when one of those heavy South\nFlorida cloudbursts strike while I'm driving, I turn off my radio\nbecause I feel it is interfering with my ability to concentrate on\nthat sheet of water running down my windshield, and beyond.\n\n   Does this relate to cell phones? Yes it does. I have had an\nautomobile with a hands-free phone and ones that require\nhand-helds. In either situation, I sometimes found myself\nconcentrating too much on what was being said, either by me or the\nother party, and needed to take quick action to correct my driving.\n\n   Distraction is a major danger to auto safety. It is not limited\nto cell phones or radios and that's why selective bans may not be\nthe cure-all. There are also many out there who believe roadside\nbillboards can distract a driver from his or her attention to the\nhighway. Others, like me, believe they are a welcome break during\nan otherwise monotonous, sleep-inducing long haul on a turnpike.\n\n   For several years, cellular telephones have been under attack.\nThere's the brain tumor thing, and the driving safety factor, both\npersistent arguments _ whether documented or not.\n\n   I wonder how many cellular calls made from or to automobiles are\nnecessary and how many are just social, passing the time of day\nwhile driving along; the latter to which I often would plead\nguilty.\n\n   A cellular phone is a valuable instrument to have if your car\nbreaks down, if you are in an accident or if you become lost.\nHowever, all three stated necessities can be handled by the\nroadside, while the vehicle is not in motion.\n\n   This is what the cell phone antagonists are contending, and the\ndeath of that lovely girl on the bike path is just the sort of\ntragedy that could lead to more legislative bodies passing\nprohibitive laws about in-motion calls.\n\n   Howard Kleinberg, a former editor of the Miami News, is a\ncolumnist for Cox Newspapers.
