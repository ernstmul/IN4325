In searching for extra-terrestrial life, should we be sending\nlight into space and looking for those same transmissions coming\nback, instead of listening for radio or electric signals?\n\n   H.K., Chelsea, Mass.\n\n   A. As a matter of fact, scientists started looking for bursts of\nlaser light from out there just last October. And they're looking\nfor signals from far away from a spot pretty close by, at the\n61-inch optical telescope in Harvard, Mass.\n\n   Physicist Paul Horowitz is the principal investigator. For years\nhe's run a search for extra terrestrial intelligence, one of\nseveral such SETI projects, listening for radio signals from outer\nspace. The thinking is that any intelligent life that wants\neverybody to know they are out there would use radio waves to make\nthemselves known, because they spread across the universe in all\ndirections.\n\n   But American physicist Charles Townes, who shared the 1964 Nobel\nPrize in Physics for discoveries that led to the laser, has\npersuaded SETI scientists to use light as well, by showing them how\nbright it can be. A laser at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence\nLivermore Lab at Los Alamos can put out a nanosecond (one billionth\nof a second) burst that outshines our sun by 3,000 times.\n\n   If we have something like that, Townes reasons, civilizations on\nplanets that are billions of years older than ours, which would\npresumably be more advanced, would have even more powerful light\nsources. Since light energy isn't absorbed by interstellar gas and\ndust the way radio waves are, Townes and the SETI folks reason that\nadvanced civilizations might use light instead of radio waves to\nadvertise their existence. And those civilizations might be\nadvanced enough to know which planets in other galaxies have\nconditions that are right to support life, and could precisely aim\ntheir narrow beams of light at whomever they want to contact.\n\n   So Horowitz built a device to look for E.T.'s lasers. Since\nOctober, it has detected three dozen events whose electrical\nsignatures are the same as a flash of light.\n\n   Is that a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence? Astronomer\nRobert Stefanik, who runs the observatory doing the work, says,\n``We don't know of any natural phenomenon that creates pulses like\nthis.''\n\n   Horowitz is skeptical, saying ``they're probably just artifacts\nof the detector, radioactive decay particles or something like\nthat.''\n\n   They have trained the telescope back at the same spots but did\nnot see a second signal, which might indicate a pattern and\nintelligent life.\n\n   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence continues. And now\nwe're not just listening. We're looking, too.\n\n    \n\n   (Readers are invited to send science questions to How&Why.
