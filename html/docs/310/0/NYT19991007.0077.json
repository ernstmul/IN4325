Sure, you can slide in a tape or CD to escape it, but\nby and large, you've learned to live with talk as part of the radio\nexperience, especially when you're behind the wheel.\n\n   That's about to change, thanks to satellite radio and its\npromise of channels filled with all music, all the time.\n\n   For consumers willing to plunk down $200 for a new car radio\nreceiver, plus a $10 monthly service fee, both XM Satellite Radio\nof Washington, DC (www.xmradio.com) and rival CD Radio of Manhattan\n(www.cdradio.com) are hoping to change the way people think about\nmusic and driving.\n\n   Currently the only two companies licensed by the Federal\nCommunications Commission to provide satellite radio service, both\nplan to provide largely commercial-free programming using competing\nsatellite networks. Both companies are scheduled to launch their\nservice within a few months of each other at the tail end of 2000\nand the beginning of 2001.\n\n   XM Radio recently filed for an initial public offering and is in\nthe midst of an SEC-mandated ``quiet period'' that prevents its\nemployees from publicly commenting on the company's future. CD\nRadio, which has been public since 1994, recently filed for an\nadditional round of funding, and is also in the midst of a quiet\nperiod.\n\n   Both companies believe consumers not only will like the lack of\nadvertising on many channels, but also will be willing to pay for\nthe high quality sound, coast-to-coast coverage, and wide range of\nchoice that will be available among the approximately 100 channels\nof programming that both CD Radio and XM Radio will offer.\n\n   Of these 100 channels, both companies plan to devote about half\nto all-music formats while offering a range of news, sports,\nforeign language, and more traditional talk programming on the\nremaining channels.\n\n   Consumers will be able to buy a packaged adapter and antenna set\nthat will enable existing car sound systems to receive satellite\nsignals, or they can purchase fully integrated systems to replace\ntheir existing units, much like people currently upgrade car\nradios.\n\n   In late 2000 and early 2001, selected Ford models are scheduled\nto arrive from the factory with CD Radio receivers; XM Radio has a\nsimilar deal with a select, but so far unannounced, number of\nGeneral Motors models.\n\n   Once consumers properly equip their cars with the antenna and\nreceiver, and pay the subscriber fee, they'll be ready to start\nreceiving programming. Beamed in the form of a data stream, both CD\nRadio and XM Radio will uplink programming from their respective\nstudios to a satellite positioned near or above the United States.\nFrom the satellite, the data stream will be bounced back or\nreflected to a car antenna equipped to receive a satellite transmis\n\n   sion. The antenna, in turn, moves the signal to the receiver,\nwhich processes and plays the music in digital quality sound.\n\n   Because satellite radio broadcasts will consist of data streams,\nand not traditional audio waves, each company plans to include more\nthan just music as part of its package. As each song is played, the\nreceiver could display the name and length of the song, the name of\nthe artist, plus information about where to purchase the music or\neven tickets for concerts by that artist.\n\n   Although both companies project relatively inexpensive costs for\nconsumers, each face steep development costs. Programming costs\naside, each company is spending millions to implement a network of\ntwo (in the case of XM Radio) or three (in the case of CD Radio)\nsatellites, enough to ensure that at least one satellite will be\norbiting above North America at all times.\n\n   Additionally, both CD Radio and XM Radio need to develop a\nso-called terrestrial repeater network that will bridge the gaps in\nservice that will exist in the so-called urban canyons in the\ndowntown areas of virtually every major U.S. metropolitan area.\nThese repeaters, which function similarly to the way cell phone\ntowers re-broadcast signals to mobile phone users, will be placed\non existing buildings or towers in upwards of 50 cities to ensure\ncomplete coverage.\n\n   CD Radio and XM Radio will compete in the satellite radio market\n(the receivers will not be compatible, so consumers will likely\nchoose only one service or the other). However, satellite\ntechnology itself won't force listeners to give up their\ntraditional AM or FM habits unless they want to.\n\n   So, as commuting times across the nation creep higher and\nhigher, and as the consumer demand for convergence and choice\ncontinues to expand, will satellite radio strike a chord with\ndrivers? Or will they still be tuned to talk radio, Top 40, or\nclassic rock favorites?\n\n   Maybe someone will do a call-in show to find out.\n\n     \n(Michael Manning is the content manager for boston.com, the Boston\nGlobe's Web site.
