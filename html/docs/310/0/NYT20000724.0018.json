First, Armstrong, who\nhad been diagnosed with testicular cancer in late 1996, became\nknown as ``Tour leader, cancer survivor.'' Then some of the\nEuropean press took it a step further and asked: How could he turn\nin a performance like that without being enhanced by drugs?\n\n   Hounded by the media, Armstrong seemed to be scowling\nconstantly. He tried to ingratiate himself to the Europeans by\nspeaking French, but that didn't work; he said he was\nmisinterpreted. So he went back to English _ and scowling.\n\n   The final zing came when his victory was called hollow because\nnone of his chief rivals were there. Former Tour winners Marco\nPantani and Jan Ullrich were no-shows, as was former fourth-place\nfinisher Laurent Jalabert.\n\n   ``I couldn't control who wasn't here, but I know it made people\ncritical of my performance, and I thought a lot about that,'' he\nsaid. ``A lot. All winter, all spring, all May and June, and all up\nthe mountains. There was a whole list of people who thought they\ncould win the Tour after Lance Armstrong won the Tour.\n\n   ``So, yes, this is a vindication.''\n\n   This year, Armstrong seemed at home in the yellow jersey. He\nfielded questions about his struggle on the last climb; he admitted\nthat ``giving'' Pantani the win one day was a mistake, but laughed\nit off, calling Pantani ``Elephantino,'' as he's dubbed in the\nParis papers.\n\n   Armstrong bided his time the first week as he rode well enough\nto stay up front, but not enough to take the overall lead, choosing\nto let others assume the pressure of wearing the yellow jersey.\n\n   At the beginning of the second week, as the Tour arrived at the\nPyrenees, Armstrong made his move.\n\n   He plowed up the first mountain stage in the cold and rain to\nthe summit at Lourdes-Hautacam. He didn't win the stage, but had\nridden well enough to claim the yellow jersey.\n\n   It was, perhaps, his finest moment of the race, he said later.\n\n   Armstrong never relinquished the yellow jersey, and his lead\nwould grow to six minutes over second-place finisher Ullrich.\n\n   Johan Bruyneel, the director of Armstrong's US Postal Service\nteam, said his star rider is more formidable than he was in 1999.\n\n   ``He's stronger now than last year, and is still improving,''\nBruyneel said. ``He's pretty scary; if he gets stronger, it's not\nlooking good for the others.''\n\n   Armstrong said even though he is glad the talk this year focused\nmore on his racing than on his having survived cancer, he has mixed\nfeelings.\n\n   ``I know I'm still part of that family (of cancer survivors) and\nwill always be part of that family,'' he said. ``And I knew also\nthat the media were not going to talk about it that much this year,\nbecause it was such a story last year that I didn't think it would\ncome about.''\n\n   But the fact remains, he won two Tours after being diagnosed\nwith cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. That's still\nthe message he wants to get across.\n\n   ``I'm still healthy, and it's always a struggle,'' he said. ``My\nhealth is not guaranteed forever, but the fact that I'm still here\nand cancer-free is still the most important thing in my life. That\nwill always be my message.''\n\n   Armstrong said he's not ready to talk about what kind of legacy\nhe'll leave.\n\n   ``With one and two (Tour wins), you don't leave a legacy, and\nwith three, well, I don't know,'' he said. ``And I don't know how\nsomebody wins this five times.''\n\n   But he will be back to go for a third, he said, and to wear\nyellow on the Champs Elysees one more time.\n\n   ``I'll definitely be back next year, I promise you that,'' he\nsaid.''\n","Headline":"\nARMSTRONG REPEATS FEAT \n","Text":["\n   PARIS _ Yellow _ with a splash of red, white, and blue _ was the\ncolor in vogue on the Champs Elysees Sunday as American Lance\nArmstrong won the Tour de France for the second year in a row.\n","\n   His gloves were yellow, his helmet was yellow, and the spokes on\nhis bike were yellow as he made the journey into Paris.\n","\n   Standing alone on the podium after the three-week race,\nArmstrong took off his yellow cap and put it over his winner's\nyellow jersey as ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' played and fans\nwildly waved American flags.\n","\n   Then his wife, Kristin, and 9-month-old son, Luke, joined him on\nthe stage, and the winner put his son _ also in a yellow jersey _\non his shoulders as he waved to the crowd.\n","\n   ``This little guy gave me a lot of motivation in the past\nyear,'' said Armstrong, 28. ``It's been a hard Tour de France, but\nthis is my first as a father, so it's very special.''\n","\n   Armstrong, who earned more than $300,000 for winning the\n21-stage, 2,250-mile Tour by 6 minutes 2 seconds over his nearest\npursuer, was the first rider to win the Tour in consecutive years\nsince Spaniard Miguel Indurain in 1995 (he had won the previous\nfour years).\n","\n   But there was such a difference between Armstrong's two\nvictories.\n","\n   ``I think I arrived in Paris last year mentally tired, and I'm\narriving this year physically tired,'' he said.\n","\n   Last year's win was clouded with subplots.
