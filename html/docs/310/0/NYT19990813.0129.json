HOWE  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ Thousands of folks love to drive around New\nEngland looking for the hot spots. Eugene Giordano, on the other\nhand, racks up 3,000 miles a month looking for the dead spots.\n\n   As wireless telephone companies serving the region battle for\nbest-coverage boasting rights and try to reduce customer gripes\nabout scratchy and dropped calls, Giordano pilots one of Bell\nAtlantic Mobile's key weapons: a Ford Taurus station wagon\noutfitted with $250,000 worth of electronics and a porcupine-quill\narray of antennas on the roof.\n\n   Over the course of eight long days each month, Giordano drives a\n1,700-mile route, plus another 1,300 miles deadheading back to his\nWestborough laboratory, where he spends the rest of his time\nanalyzing and reporting data. As he drives, an on-board computer\nmakes thousands of calls from eight wireless phones housed in\ngun-metal-grey boxes behind the back seat.\n\n   With Global Positioning System receivers charting the car's\nlocation every second, a laptop computer mounted on the dashboard\nrecords and displays how well calls get through, how many calls\neach carrier drops and where, and where Bell and its five rivals\nhave patchy or missing coverage.\n\n   All six wireless companies serving Greater Boston routinely send\ntechnicians on patrol to test their cell networks' calling\nstrength. But Bell Atlantic, with 6.2 million customers around the\ncountry, has been among the most aggressive at marketing its tests\nas a selling point to prospective customers.\n\n   ``Bell Atlantic has really tried to define network quality and\nnetwork coverage as a differentiator for them,'' said Mark\nLowenstein, a leading wireless-industry analyst with The Yankee\nGroup in Boston.\n\n   While wireless calling remains ``the most competitive sector in\nthe telecom industry,'' Lowenstein said, ``prices have rapidly\nconverged, so the cost difference between one carrier and another\nis not significant.''\n\n   However, customers count on being able to make and get calls\nfrom a carrier throughout their region. That makes network coverage\nan increasingly important buying point for the 33,000 Americans who\nsign up for cell phones every day.\n\n   Among Bell's local rivals, for example, Omnipoint has four\ntwo-person teams of ``drive testers'' who are out ``all the time''\nchecking on network reliability and even developing seasonal tweaks\nto account for lost coverage in warm months when foliage grows\ndense, spokeswoman Karin Olson said.\n\n   ``I don't think what Bell Atlantic is doing is anything more\nthan what we're doing here,'' said John Redman of Nextel, which\nmade a special blitz of the Boston Marathon route earlier this year\nto ensure the 325 radio-cell phone units it donated for calling in\nrace updates would have uninterrupted service.\n\n   AT&T Wireless, Cellular One, and Sprint PCS also do the same\nrolling surveillance as Bell Atlantic Mobile, both to measure\nperformance and identify where they need to add towers or rent\nantenna space on rivals' towers to fill service gaps.\n\n   Generally speaking, to ensure clear reception and enough\nchannels to serve demand, wireless companies need a broadcasting\nsite every 4 miles along a highway, many more in cities such as\nBoston and Cambridge and fewer in light-traffic rural areas.\n\n   For wireless companies, knowing exactly where new towers are\nneeded from on-the-road tests, and not just pins on a map, is also\neconomically vital. Local zoning boards throughout New England have\nbeen toughening tower siting rules in response to complaints about\nunsightly antenna proliferation and largely unproven but, among\nsome people, hard-to-shake fears that cell towers' electromagnetic\nradiation is a public health menace.\n\n   Earlier this week, American Tower Inc. of Boston paid nearly\n$381,000 per tower for each of 2,100 sites owned by Vodafone\nAirTouch PLC, which American Tower will lease back to AirTouch and\nuse to install rivals' antennas. ``Towers are becoming a very\nvaluable commodity,'' Lowenstein said.\n\n   In forested parts of Massachusetts, including one spot east of\nInterstate 495 in Bolton, AT&T has pioneered cell towers camoflaged\nas tall, if sickly looking, pine trees. The towers have rubber bark\nand antenna-disguising branches made of a special plastic that lets\nradio waves pass through unimpeded and, seen at 65 m.p.h., blend\ninto the tree line.\n\n   Bell Atlantic has 380 cell sites around the region bounded by\nsouthwestern Maine, Worcester, and Cape Cod, more than two-thirds\nof which have been erected on structures including buildings, water\ntowers, and church steeples.\n\n   In coming years, said Richard B. Enright, northeast network\nengineering director for Bell Atlantic Mobile, the company will\nspend over $100 million beefing up coverage in spottily served\nareas such as Cape Cod, along Route 2 west of Concord, and on Route\n3 in Plymouth. Earlier this week it added coverage in the\nMassachusetts Turnpike extension tunnel under the Prudential\nCenter, using a coaxial cable system already installed in the three\nharbor tunnels.\n\n   Cellular networks operate by constantly determining which tower\nis in the best location to serve a given telephone in use. As the\nconnection to one tower weakens, network computers decide which\ntower should ``take the handoff,'' then transfer the call to the\nnext cell down the road, ideally with the caller hearing _ if\nanything _ only a sudden improvement in clarity.\n\n   Giordano's testing regimen regularly helps engineers determine\nwhether various towers' coverage should be extended or shortened in\ncertain directions to ensure the most efficient distribution of\ncalls among towers, although such ``tweaking'' can only go so far,\nsaid Bell network manager Gian DaGama.\n\n   ``Any wireless carrier that tells you they're not going to have\ndropped calls or other problems is really misleading you,'' said\nNextel's Redman.\n\n   Giordano's job has nice perks, such as the chance to sightsee in\nthe rolling mountains of New Hampshire and Worcester County, and\nthe seashores of southern Rhode Island and Cape Cod. But he spends\nmany hours slogging along considerably less scenic, traffic-clogged\nroads including I-495 and Route 128 and the streets of downtown\nBoston.\n\n   He is also treated to a mind-boggling cacophony of\ncomputer-generated chatter from the Comarco Wireless Technologies\ntesting system. During every 150-second-long simulated conversation\nduring a test session, computer-driven voice modules in the car and\nat the Westborough lab speak a script of pre-recorded nonsense\nphrases designed to include hard-to-decipher phonetic sounds and\ndifferent male and female voices.\n\n   ``Chicken leg is a rare dish,'' one phone might say. ``Fill the\nink jar with sticky glue,'' the lab computer responds. ``He smokes\na big pipe with strong content,'' adds another voice.\n\n   ``It will drive you crazy if you listen too hard to all of it,''\nGiordano said with a laugh as he cruised up I-495 toward a ``dead\nspot'' near the Route 2 interchange in Harvard that Bell Atlantic\nis trying to fix.\n\n   ``I don't mind the driving,'' said Giordano, but when he is\nparked running tests, he does find that ``I seem to be a target''\nfor police officers who want to know what he is doing _ and\nsometimes ask whether he is an FBI agent or a spy.\n\n   And if he happens to stop along a highway to check cellular\ncoverage, he said, ``Traffic slows down to a crawl because they all\nthink I'm a state trooper,'' thanks to the 13 antennas on the roof.\n","Headline":"\nBELL ATLANTIC SLEUTH FIND THE FADE IN CELLULAR\n","Text":["\n   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ Thousands of folks love to drive around New\nEngland looking for the hot spots.
