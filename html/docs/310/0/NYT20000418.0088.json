With CELL-LAWS and CELL-DATA. For release Sunday,\nApril 23.\n      By CHARLES W. HOLMES\n      c.2000 Cox News Service\n\n   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ Take heed in this working-class burg on the\nsouthern outskirts of Cleveland. Motorcycle cop Rick Hovan has a\nsharp eye out for motorists who dare to gab on their mobile phones\nwhile cruising through town.\n\n   Brooklyn (pop. 11,000) welcomes visitors at its city limits with\na stern reminder on roadside signs: ``Park 2 Talk. It's the Law.''\n\n   It was the first municipality in the nation to ban the use of\nhand-held cellular telephones while driving, a law created last\nyear after a city employee changing a tire was nearly run down by a\ndriver with a phone to his ear.\n\n   Driving and talking is a social epidemic nearly everyone seems\nto complain about, yet nearly everyone with a cell phone does.\n\n   Every two seconds in America, a new customer signs up for mobile\ntelephone service, and the total number of subscribers is already\nmore than 91 million. As many as 85 percent of drivers with phones\nuse them at least occasionally while on the road, according to a\nrecent survey.\n\n   Some law enforcement officials and safety policy experts fear\nthat the risks will only grow as car manufacturers and the wireless\ntelecommunications industry team up on designs for a generation of\n``smart'' cars offering built-in telephones, computer mapping\ndisplays, Internet access and voice-activated e-mail. Ford and GM\nare set to offer digital services in selected luxury models next\nyear.\n\n   ``Should drivers keep both hands on the wheel? Any reasonable\nperson would say, 'Of course,''' said Fran Bents, a researcher who\nco-authored a 1997 study of wireless devices and driving by the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\n   Yet despite proposals introduced in at least 34 states since\n1995, including Georgia and Texas, no state legislature has managed\nto pass meaningful restrictions on cell phone use by motorists.\nOnly a handful of small cities have enacted such laws.\n\n   ``Unlike other transportation safety issues like drunk driving\nand seat belt use, you don't have a strong, well-organized national\ngroup behind this issue, but you've got the telecommunications\nindustry lobbying hard against it,'' said Matt Sundeen, a policy\nspecialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n   Brooklyn, a town of trim, suburban bungalows and several robust\nfactories _ home of American Greetings, the greeting card maker _\npassed its law in March 1999 and began enforcing it last September.\n\n   The law bans hand-held phones, but allows hands-free devices.\nAbout 300 tickets have been issued. With a fine of just $3 per\ncitation, less than a parking ticket, the law is intended to raise\npublic awareness, not fill the city's coffers.\n\n   ``I think people are tired of seeing drivers weave in and out of\ntraffic, paying more attention to their conversation on the phone\nthan what's in front of them on the road. It's a nuisance,'' said\nPolice Chief Jack Murphy.\n\n   In Pennsylvania, Patricia Pena knows first-hand the danger. Her\n2-year-old daughter, Morgan Lee, died last November from injuries\nsuffered in an accident in Hilltown Township, near Philadelphia,\nwhen a driver on a cell phone ran a stop sign and broadsided Pena's\ncar.\n\n   In suburban Gwinnett County near Atlanta, Lisa Duffner, 35, had\na similar experience as she and her family took a walk on their\nquiet street. A teen-age driver on a cell phone ran up onto the\nlawn, killing her 2-year-old son Ryan and the family dog in March\n1999. Duffner was in a coma for three days, only to awake to the\nnews from her husband that Ryan was dead.\n\n   Pena and Duffner are leading a grassroots crusade to warn of the\ndangers of cell phones and driving. Pena has made appearances on\nnational television, including the ``Oprah'' show, and before state\nlawmakers in Pennsylvania.\n\n   Duffner appeared before a Georgia legislative committee earlier\nthis year to support a bill. She is distributing bumper stickers\nthat read: ``Hang up and drive _ cell phone abuse kills,'' and\nplans to create a Web site and lead a drive to convince the Georgia\nlegislature to act in next year's session.\n\n   ``I think people think we're trying to take away their freedoms.\nWell, my son had rights, too. He had the right to live,'' said\nDuffner.\n\n   ``I'd go anywhere. I'd do anything to talk about this issue. I\nfeel I owe it to my daughter,'' Pena said in a telephone interview.\n``My goal is to make this socially unacceptable, to make drivers\nembarrassed to have a phone at their ear and to make people on the\nother end threaten to hang up if they know the person they talking\nto is behind the wheel.''\n\n   Since Pena's accident, three Pennsylvania towns have created\nlaws restricting cell phone use, and some 300 municipalities around\nthe country are considering similar ordinances.\n\n   Tom and Ray Magliozzi, hosts of the popular ``Car Talk'' show on\nNational Public Radio, also have taken up the cause. They\ndistribute bumper stickers declaring: ``Drive Now, Talk Later.''\n\n   Few state and local governments keep statistics on cell phone\nuse as a contributing factor in traffic accidents. With a lack of\nhard evidence, state legislators have been reluctant to impose\nrestrictions that could provoke the fury of constituents who enjoy\nthe convenience of cell phones.\n\n   The mobile telephone industry and automobile manufacturers\noppose laws restricting the use of phones and other electronic\ngadgets, contending that drivers simply need to be educated in\norder to prevent accidents. When radios began appearing in the\nfirst production automobiles in the early 20th century, critics of\nproposed cell phone restrictions point out, some officials wanted\nto ban them.\n\n   ``Every single state has laws that address careless driving,\ninattentive driving, reckless driving. Police know it when they see\nit, whether the driver is using a radio or putting on makeup or\nusing a wireless telephone,'' said Lisa Ihde, who runs the public\neducation program for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation.\n\n   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)\n\n   The industry association has created a safety-awareness campaign\non its Web site and with a toll-free number (1-888-901-SAFE). The\nindustry also points to statistics that suggest that cell phones in\ncars save lives. The ability of motorists to make 911 calls to\nreport accidents has reduced paramedic response times.\n\n   Yet a controversial 1997 Canadian study published in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine concluded that the risk of an accident\nincreases fourfold if a driver is using a cell phone, about the\nsame risk as driving while drunk when measuring factors such as\nreaction time and susceptibility to being easily distracted.\n\n   The study's authors have since pointed out, though, the drinking\nand driving is far more dangerous for a long list of other reasons,\nsuch as the lingering effects of alcohol in the bloodstream.\n\n   A National Highway Transportation Safety Administration report\nof 1998 crash data showed that driver distraction was a factor in\nabout 1 of every four fatal accidents. Cellular phones were a\nfactor in at least 57 deaths, compared with only seven in 1991.\n\n   But experts consider the data to be weak because of the lack of\nnationwide reporting. For the most part, an eyewitness or police\nofficer must see a driver on the phone to record it as part of the\naccident report. Drivers involved in accidents can easily slip the\nphone into a pocket or glove compartment.\n\n   From the vantage point atop his Harley Davidson, patrolman Hovan\nsees the dangers nearly every day as drivers with phones drift\nacross lanes and roll through stop signs.\n\n   On a recent rainy spring day in Brooklyn, Hovan pulled over a\nluxury sedan to write a ticket to a man on his cell phone. The\ndriver protested, saying he was a vascular surgeon who needed to\nuse his phone to deal with medical cases and operating-room\nschedules.\n\n   With the ticket, Hovan issued his bottom-line warning: Is\ntalking on the phone worth risking taking a life? Why not pull over\nto finish your call?\n\n   ``He didn't want to hear it. He's got a hectic lifestyle,\nemergencies, kids with him in the car,'' Hovan said. ``Everybody\nthinks they have no time and they've got to be on the phone while\nthey drive.''\n\n   To hammer home his message, Hovan now carries a picture of\nMorgan Lee Pena, sent to him by her mother, and explains the story\nof the dead Pennsylvania girl to the drivers he stops.\n\n   ``I tell people, 'The city doesn't want your three dollars.\nDamn, I'll give you three dollars to pay the fine. Just please be\naware of the danger,''' said Hovan. ``Some tell me they think it's\nstupid, and you know what I say to people like that? 'I wonder if\nyou'd say the same thing if it had been your daughter.' ``\n\n   On the Web:\n\n   National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:\nwww.nhtsa/gov/people/injury/research/wireless/index.html\n\n   National Conference of State Legislatures:\nwww.ncsl.org/programs/ESNR/phonauto.html\n\n   New England Journal of Medicine:\nwww.nejm.org/content/1997/0336/0007/0453.asp\n\n   Patricia Pena's campaign for cellular phone legislation:\nwww.geocities.com/morganleepena/\n\n   Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association safety\ncampaign: www.wow-com.com/consumer/driving/safety/cfm\n\n   Charles W.
