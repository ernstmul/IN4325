The scan found that the lump was not\ncancerous. But it did discover that the cancer had spread to her\nhips _ something that had not been detected by MRI and CT scans.\n\n   Although the news was not good, the diagnosis bought O'Rourke\ntime. Without the scan, it might have taken months for doctors to\ndiscover the cancer had spread. But as soon as the cancer was\nconfirmed, she started taking aredia, an experimental medicine\ndesigned to help bones retain calcium and block the disease.\n\n   ``You need to know these things,'' said O'Rourke, a Peachtree\nCity mother of a 13-year-old. ``Time becomes so precious. And this\nscan gave me a head start in trying to fight back.''\n\n   PET, a pricey technology that has traditionally been confined to\nacademic centers, could soon make its way into community hospitals.\nAnd that means more patients like O'Rourke, who was scanned at the\nEmory Center for PET, could get a clearer picture of how sick they\nare.\n\n   More than two dozen Atlanta doctors attended a symposium\nsponsored by Northside Hospital this week to learn about PET, short\nfor positron emission tomography. And depending on their level of\nenthusiasm, hospitals might show more interest in buying the\nmachines, which can cost as much as $3 million.\n\n   Northside Hospital, for example, is conducting a cost analysis\nof PET. ``I would like to try and get a PET scanner by the year\n2000,'' said Dr. James B. Weinstein, director of nuclear medicine\nand co-director of diagnostic ultrasound at Northside Hospital.\n\n   There's little argument that PET is a valuable clinical tool.\nFrom heart disease to cancer to mental illness, studies have shown\nthat the scanner has an impressive track record of finding disease\nthat other scanners have missed.\n\n   ``The bottom line is PET is a clinical tool that community\nhospitals should be using,'' said Ernest V. Garcia, physicist and\ndirector of the Emory Center for PET, the only center in Georgia\nthat conducts PET scans.\n\n   Unlike X-rays and other imaging technologies that essentially\ntake pictures of organs, bones and blood, PET scans provide images\nof how the body is actually working or being affected by disease.\nFor example, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT-scan would\nshow ``beautiful'' anatomical pictures of a dead patient's brain,\nGarcia said. But it would take a PET scan to show that the brain is\nactually dead.\n\n   PET relies on chemical tracers injected into patients to track\nbody processes. A glucose tracer, for instance, is used to detect\ncancer cells with PET. Cancer cells are particularly voracious in\ntheir consumption of the base sugar. So as the glucose travels\nthroughout the body, a radioactive marker remains where it is most\nused _ allowing physicians to pinpoint regions of cancer undetected\nby other scan.\n\n   O'Rourke said the procedure was ``stress-free.'' It wasn't like\nan MRI, where she was confined with ear plugs in a cylinder with\noxygen pumped in. The PET required O'Rourke to lie very still on a\ntable after she was injected with the glucose tracer. And then the\nmachine scanned her from head to toe, taking images from above.\n\n   PET has much better cancer detection rates than other forms of\nscanners, according to the Institute for Clinical PET and the UCLA\nSchool of Medicine. For example, abstracts and studies published\nsince the early 1990s have found:\n\n   PET has an 81 percent detection rate for lung cancer, compared\nwith a 52 percent rate with a CT scanner; a 95 percent rate for\ncolon cancer, compared with 68 percent with CT; and an 85 percent\nrate for breast cancer, compared with 67 percent with mammography.\nThe scanner also can detect whether a cancer has spread beyond\ndoctors' abilities to treat it. That prevents patients from going\nthrough surgery, or rigorous radiation and chemotherapy treatments,\nthat will not save them.\n\n   More importantly, it can also show how well treatment is\nworking, Weinstein said.\n\n   PET is useful in heart attack cases because the scanner is able\nto detect how much heart tissue is damaged. That is critical\nbecause it can help a surgeon determine whether the patient should\nhave bypass surgery, or perhaps be listed as an organ transplant\ncandidate. And it has been extremely effective in diagnosing\nseizure disorders, such as epilepsy, and mental illnesses such as\nAlzheimer's disease.\n\n   But PET suffers from its own image problems. Because private\ninsurance and Medicare, the government health care plan for the\nelderly, have traditionally refused to reimburse for PET use,\ncommunity hospitals have had little motivation to invest in the\nscanners. It is also about twice as expensive as other scanners -\ncosting $2,000 a scan, compared to $1,000 for a standard MRI.\n\n   In addition, PET does not give a clean image of the body like\nmore traditional machines, but merely pinpoints hot spots of cancer\ngrowth or other disease. ``Surgeons like to deal with things that\nlook like what they see in surgery,'' Weinstein said. ``PET gives\nyou a fuzzy picture that doesn't directly correspond to the anatomy\nand a lot of surgeons don't like that.''\n\n   In addition, MRI, CT and ultrasound technologies are starting to\nuse some of the same principals of PET. A new enhanced MRI\ntechnology _ that can distinguish between benign and malignant\ntumors _ is being tested in clinical trials in Chicago. And there\nare discussions on how to combine PET with more traditional\nscanners, said Jennifer Keppler, director for the Institute for\nClinical PET.\n\n   Recently, PET has become more attractive to community hospitals\nbecause Medicare, the government health plan for the elderly,\nagreed this year to pay for the scans on a limited basis. And more\nmanaged care companies have approved its cost _ mostly because of\ndata that reflects its accuracy in detection and its ability to\nhelp doctors pick the most appropriate course of treatment, which\nin advanced cases of disease, may be no treatment at all.\n\n   Wayne Hoffman, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia vice\npresident, said the insurer covers PET in such cases as epileptic\npatients who are candidates for surgery and certain lung cancer\npatients. However, many others are still considered\ninvestigational, he said, and may not be covered.\n\n   ``Our medical policies are always under review,'' said Hoffman.\n``And our staff is constantly reviewing medical literature to learn\nabout new technologies, which includes PET scanning.''\n\n   And with that nod of approval, community hospitals are\nre-evaluating such a purchase.\n\n   ``It's very impressive,'' said Dr. Ron Steis, an oncologist with\nAtlanta Cancer Care, who attended the symposium. ``But here's the\nbottom line: It might be the best thing since sliced bread, but if\npatients can't pay the price, and insurance companies won't, it\nends up being a nice tool that's not very useful.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Barbara O'Rourke learned last year she had an advanced\ncase of breast cancer that could take her life within 18 months.\nBut the 42-year-old mother is trying to stay alive as long as\npossible to see her teen-age daughter grow.\n","\n   Which is why when she discovered a lump under her arm, O'Rourke\nwanted to know if it too was cancerous.\n","\n   Her doctor ordered a PET scan, one of the most cutting-edge\ndiagnostic tools in medicine.
