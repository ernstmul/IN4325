Neither does the\nhandshake with which Mucci greets a visitor at the front door of\nhis family's home in Castleton, south of Albany.\n\n   Eight years after beating a brain tumor, cancer no longer claims\ncenter stage in Philip Mucci's life.\n\n   Mucci is part of the first big wave of childhood cancer\nsurvivors to reach adulthood.

The researchers questioned\n13,254 former patients who were treated between 1970 and 1986. They\ncollected detailed treatment histories, including the total amounts\nof drugs the children had been given and what health issues the\nsurvivors have faced since they finished treatment. It is clear\nthat for many survivors, cancer and the harsh therapies it took to\nbeat it exact a toll later in life.\n\n   Daniel Green, a childhood cancer specialist at the Roswell Park\nCancer Institute in Buffalo, has spent 20 years studying cancer\nsurvivors and the effects of various cancer treatments.\n\n   Many cancer therapies leave patients sterile, Green said, but\nfor both men and women who have remained fertile the resulting\npregnancies have largely been normal. Some women who've had\nradiation to the pelvis have premature babies. And others who were\ntreated with certain chemotherapy drugs hit menopause 10 to 15\nyears early as their diminished egg supplies run out.\n\n   Childhood cancer survivors who have been in remission for 15 or\nmore years are four to five times more likely to develop fatal\nhealth problems than the rest of the population, Green said. The\nhigher mortality rates are mainly due to recurrences of the\noriginal cancer, treatment-induced cancers and treatment-induced\nheart diseases.\n\n   The role of genetics in childhood cancer is a big unanswered\nquestion, said Green.\n\n   ``One thing that is still unknown is whether the offspring are\nat greater risk of developing childhood cancer,'' Green said.\n``It'll probably be another two to three years before we have data\non cancer in offspring.''\n\n   These days Mucci spends more time thinking about his new job at\na summer camp in Maryland than worrying about his odds.\n\n   Mucci spent years staring cancer down. After he got healthy, he\nreturned to Albany Medical Center to work as an intern, spending a\nlot of time with radiologists. He read his medical files something\nhe wouldn't recommend to everybody. It was hard to come face to\nface with his own numbers, the high levels of radiation, the\nchanging odds of survival. But Mucci read on.\n\n   ``It was hard reading all the technical terms that they were\nusing and reading that I might have died,'' he said. ``But if you\nunderstand something, it is really hard to be afraid of it.''\n\n   Mucci went to college and majored in biology, thinking he would\ngo into cancer research. That has changed in the last year or so as\nthe urge to stare down the monster has given way to the desire to\nget on with his life.\n\n   Sometime during college, cancer loosened its grip on Mucci. He\nstarted wearing his shoulder-length hair in a ponytail because he\nlikes the style even though you can now see the wide horizontal\nscar, low on the back of his head, where hair no longer grows. He\nrecently had surgery to try and correct the damage radiation did to\nhis hearing.\n\n   He has decided to hold off on fertility testing, leaving the\nfuture to sort itself out.\n\n   Ask him about whether he thinks about the cancer coming back and\nMucci looks you in the eye and with a little smile quotes dialogue\nfrom ``The Empire Strikes Back.''\n\n   ``It's like Yoda says,'' Mucci explains. ``Always in motion is\nthe future.''\n","Headline":"\nCANCER NO LONGER TAKES CENTER STAGE IN YOUNG MAN'S LIFE \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's the room of a college kid come home for a\nfew days in between school and a summer job.\n","\n   A black Star Wars T-shirt sits on top of a pile of clothes to be\npacked.
