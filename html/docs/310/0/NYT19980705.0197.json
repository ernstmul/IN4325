Times News Service   \n\n   MIMS, Fla. _ Ed Callahan, who served all over the world with the\nArmy Special Forces and has the tattoos to prove it, stood in front\nof a pile of melted glass, scorched metal and blackened wood and\ntalked tough about the wildfire that leaped out of the Florida\npalmettos and consumed his house.\n\n   ``It don't bother me,'' he said of the once-immaculate,\nmiddle-class house with a pool that he and his wife had filled with\nmemories and treasures from his postings in Asia and elsewhere.\nLike dozens of others in central and northeast Florida last week,\nhe and his family left their house when the wildfire threatened,\nand returned to find it in ashes.\n\n   ``It's all insured,'' said Callahan, a retired master sergeant.\n``We'll re-do it. Make it even better.''\n\n   As he talked, his wife, Setsuko, squatted in the ruin of the\nhouse. A small woman, she had a smudge of soot on her face as she\ncarefully poked and sifted through a powdery ash, digging up wine\nglasses that had melted into misshapen lumps, uncovering shards of\nchina, then moving on, foot by foot.\n\n   She was looking for something in particular.\n\n   ``I lost my wedding ring,'' she said, and kept on digging.\n\n   Even as wildfires raged in counties in northeastern and central\nFlorida, firefighters, blessed with a few scattered rain showers,\nless dry wind and a higher humidity over the weekend, began gaining\nground in fire-ravaged areas instead of just grimly holding it. As\nthe smoke cleared, those here returned to find the result of the\nroaring, popping orange flames that had forced evacuations in\nscenes that have haunted the state since May.\n\n   In Mims, a small town in Brevard County near Florida's east\ncentral coast, hundreds of people returned to their homes this\nweekend. A dozen or so, like the Callahans on Golden Shores Drive,\nlost everything they could not hurriedly stuff into their car.\nOthers, like Frank Kirkland in the Hog Valley neighborhood near\nInterstate 95, came home to find some yards and outbuildings\nburned, but found with relief that firefighters had killed the\nblaze just as it touched their homes.\n\n   ``If they hadn't been standing right there,'' almost with their\nbacks to his mobile home, ``it wouldn't be here,'' said Kirkland,\nwho used to work at the Kennedy Space Center and now raises deer\ndogs and pot-bellied pigs.\n\n   And still others, like the Mayhew family just outside Mims,\ndefied evacuation orders and fought the wildfire themselves,\npumping water from a nearby pond and saving a cluster of mobile\nhomes, although, as 21-year-old Donnie Mayhew said, it almost\nseemed as if the fire was determined to have them.\n\n   ``We'd put it out in one place and it would come at us from\nsomeplace else,'' Mayhew said. ``I've never seen fire like that.''\n\n   No one has, at least here.\n\n   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 1,946 fires have\nburned 458,288 acres since June 1, causing an estimated $276\nmillion in damage _ the worst disaster since Hurricane Andrew _ and\ninjuring 95 people, mostly firefighters.\n\n   In the area around Mims and nearby Scottsmoor, about 15 miles\nsouth of the Kennedy Space Center, at least 30 houses have been\ndestroyed, as about 60 fires continued to burn in the surrounding\ncounty.\n\n   To the north, in Flagler County, a mandatory evacuation of\n30,000 people remained in effect, as people waited in shelters and\nwondered what they would find back home.\n\n   People here hope for rain, maybe even a tropical storm, but any\nheavy rain _ if it comes at all _ is still days away, forecasters\nsay.\n\n   In Mims, a part of Florida where orange groves, dense scrub and\ngreen inlets provide scenery for U.S. Highway 1, retirees,\nblue-collar workers and charter boat captains have watched for days\nas the flames threatened five-bedroom dream homes and double-wide\ntrailers, which were dream houses, too, for some here. Black smut\nstreaked several roofs of the houses still standing, and vinyl\nsiding hung wrinkled and warped from others.\n\n   Bedsheets, tied to fences and mailboxes, flapped softly in the\nfaint breeze. ``Thank You, Firefighters,'' they say.\n\n   And here and there are big piles of ash, where the flames either\nattacked houses before firefighters could get there, or, in the\ncase of a few, drove them away when they did. That is what happened\nto the Callahan house, where it got so hot firefighters had to\nthrow down their hoses and run. They returned a while later, to\napologize. But they did not have to.\n\n   Callahan, who served in Vietnam, said he did not want anyone to\nget hurt trying to save things that could be replaced. He and his\nwife and daughter, 21-year-old Naomi, were fine. So were their two\ndogs, two cats and a bird.\n\n   ``We're luckier than other people,'' said Callahan. Some\nmaterial things, of course, could not be replaced. ``All my\nmedals,'' he said. ``But hell, I know what I did.''\n\n   ``The lesson in it, is not to get attached to material things,''\nhe said, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses.\n\n   His wife called to him, a few minutes later.\n\n   ``I found an angel,'' she said, holding up a glass figure that\nhad once sat on their mantel.\n\n   As he plans the rebuilding, he sounds like the old sergeant,\nreclaiming an overrun firebase.\n\n   ``I'm going to get us a used motor home, and we will establish\nourselves again on this property,'' he said.\n\n   Then, they will start on a new dream house.\n\n   ``It's good to go through something like this,'' said Callahan.\n``It toughens you up.''\n\n   In Hog Valley, a more rural road where acres of palmettos are\nnow blackened nubs, Donnie Mayhew sat in deep shade and described\nthe wildfire that left the landscape this way.\n\n   ``We fought it ourselves,'' he said, but he wasn't bragging.\n``We were lucky.''\n\n   It began, last week, as a glow in the distance. Then, quickly,\nit was racing toward the cluster of mobile homes where Mayhew, his\nfather, Bill, and other family and friends live.\n\n   ``You could hear it coming, crackling and roaring,'' he said.\n\n   But this was no steadily marching line of flame. It burned\nerratically as the wind shifted and swirled, and new fires sprang\nup.\n\n   His family had a pond, a pump and a generator to run it. The\ngenerator saved them, after the fires burned down the power poles.\n\n   They sprayed the houses and then focused on the fire line\nitself, but every time it would seem like they had won, ``the wind\nwould shift, and it would come at us from the other end.''\n\n   Like a lot of people here, everything they have is contained in\nthe aluminum walls of those mobile homes.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   ``We were going to stay until we couldn't stay no more,'' said\nMayhew.\n\n   A few miles away, Frank Kirkland dumped a bucketful of water\nover the head of a pot-bellied pig named Little Bit. The fire had\nreached up to the wire of the pen she shared with three babies,\nand, apparently, just stopped. She snorted gratefully as the cool\nwater trickled over her ears.\n\n   His emotions were mixed. The firefighters saved his mobile home\nat the very last minute but the flames destroyed a building he\ncalled ``my pavilion.''\n\n   ``I had a TV, five picnic tables, a jukebox,'' he said. He had\nplanned a big party for the Fourth of July, and had stored two\nwhole hogs in a refrigerator, planning to barbecue them.\n\n   He opened the refrigerator and gazed down at the meat that had\nsizzled inside the freezer as the flames roared around it.\n\n   ``Didn't get good and done,'' he said, as the stench of rotting\nmeat filled the air.\n\n   For others, there were no mixed blessings, only a feeling that\nsomething terrible had passed them by.\n\n   In the shade of a tree near U.S. 1, three firefighters from\nOkeechobee _ part of the hundreds who have come here from around\nthe state and country _ rested between emergencies.\n\n   A man they had never seen walked up and thanked them. ``You guys\nsaved my house, twice,'' said Chet Richards, shaking their hands.\n\n   The firefighters, Steve Weeks, Jim Fusco and Herb Smith, said it\nis something that happens a lot to the firefighters here.\n\n   A woman drove up and asked them if they were hungry, and left\nthem with bags of food and a giant tub of chocolate chip cookies.\n\n   ``You can't walk around the corner without somebody bringing you\nfood,'' Smith said.\n\n   It makes it worthwhile, the men said, when it seems like the\nground underneath is about to melt their feet.\n","Headline":"\nIN FLORIDA, STOICISM AND THANKFULNESS FOR WHAT'S LEFT \n","Text":["\n   MIMS, Fla. _ Ed Callahan, who served all over the world with the\nArmy Special Forces and has the tattoos to prove it, stood in front\nof a pile of melted glass, scorched metal and blackened wood and\ntalked tough about the wildfire that leaped out of the Florida\npalmettos and consumed his house.\n","\n   ``It don't bother me,'' he said of the once-immaculate,\nmiddle-class house with a pool that he and his wife had filled with\nmemories and treasures from his postings in Asia and elsewhere.\nLike dozens of others in central and northeast Florida last week,\nhe and his family left their house when the wildfire threatened,\nand returned to find it in ashes.\n","\n   ``It's all insured,'' said Callahan, a retired master sergeant.\n``We'll re-do it.
