For information about purchasing this\nphoto call 202-383-7824.\n By MARGIE WYLIE  \n c.2000 Newhouse News Service  \n\n   (UNDATED) The incessant ringing was bad enough, but when patrons\nof the Whiteley Shopping Centre's cinema in London began answering\ntheir cellular telephones mid-movie _ shouting to be heard above\nthe dialogue _ Nasser Ahmadi knew something had to give.\n\n   ``Some people were getting so angry that they were leaving the\ncinema,'' said Ahmadi, a consultant to Universal Cinemas\nInternational, which operates the multiscreen movie house. ``People\nwere asking why we didn't do something about it.''\n\n   Across the globe, cell phones disturb plays, concerts and films.\nPhones ring out during funerals and weddings. They bleep and buzz\nin trains, restaurants and bathrooms. Cell-phone-free zones, polite\nrequests, even icy glares can't seem to stop the ringing and\nconsequent jabbering.\n\n   But Ahmadi found something that does: a cellular telephone\njammer.\n\n   Five months ago, he installed the C-Guard cellular telephone\nfirewall and complaints stopped. Made by an Israeli company called\nNetLine, the C-Guard is one of a handful of cell phone jammers\ncommercially available today.\n\n   But don't go looking for one at your neighborhood electronics\nstore.\n\n   ``The technology is illegal in the U.S. and it's our position\nthat it should be,'' said Travis Larson, spokesman for the Cellular\nTelephone Industry Association, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n   Within their operating radius, jammers prevent wireless phones\nfrom contacting a cellular radio tower. The affected phone behaves\nas it would any place where reception is too poor to carry a call.\n\n   Users ``don't complain because they don't know what's going\non,'' Ahmadi said. ``There are lots of places where there are\nblackouts, anyway. They think it's the construction of the\nbuilding, so they come out in the foyer to make their phone\ncalls.''\n\n   ``It's very Machiavellian but perfectly harmless,'' said\nJonathan Lemel, managing director for Special Electronic Security\nProducts, U.K. Ltd. of Manchester, England, which manufactures\njammers.\n\n   Not everyone agrees. The devices are banned in most\nindustrialized countries, which don't take kindly to disruption of\nlicensed radio services.\n\n   ``Obviously, spectrum is licensed by the FCC (Federal\nCommunications Commission) and purchased by broadcasters of all\nkind to transmit information,'' said Larson, the cellular industry\nspokesman. ``And those pieces of spectrum become the property of\nthose using them for the length of the licenses. So using a jammer\nis analogous to taking someone else's property.''\n\n   Gil Israeli, NetLine's CEO, counters that if anything's being\nstolen, it's the peace and quiet of those of us forced to endure\nloud cell phone conversations.\n\n   Regulators have no beef with people installing expensive metal\nshielding around rooms to block cell phone usage, Israeli observed.\n``Our only argument with the FCC is whether people should be\nallowed to defend their space actively as well as passively, using\nan inexpensive device,'' he said.\n\n   Richard DiSabatini, director of Intelligence Support Group,\nLtd., a jammer maker based in China Lake, Calif., agreed. ``This is\na whole gray area,'' he said. ``If you were in my home and I didn't\nwant you using your cell phone, why shouldn't I have the right to\nblock you?''\n\n   DiSabatini's firm does not advertise its jammers. It sells them\nonly for export, to the military, or to those law enforcement\nagencies exempted from FCC rules, he said.\n\n   At its simplest, jamming any radio device involves transmitting\na signal on the same frequency and at high enough power that the\ntwo signals collide and cancel each other out. The effect is\nsimilar to what happens when you drop two pebbles in still water\nand rings of waves radiate out from them. Where the rings meet, the\nwater becomes smooth.\n\n   Cellular telephones, however, are more challenging to jam than\nmost radio transmissions. Different cellular systems operate over a\nwide range of frequencies. Within those frequencies, any single\nphone may ``spectrum hop'' to find a band free of interference.\nPlus, phones can notch up their power to try to overcome\ninterference.\n\n   Cell phone jammers have to be sophisticated enough to squelch\nphone signals without interfering with other devices, from garage\ndoor openers to medical equipment. In addition, they must operate\nat power levels high enough to overcome cell phone signals, but not\nso high that the jamming effect leaks outside the intended coverage\narea.\n\n   In fact, leakage is a key reason the FCC and other regulators\nrefuse to license jammers, Israeli said. But if governments set\nspecific rules for exactly how much leakage could be tolerated, he\nsaid, NetLine could meet them.\n\n   ``You don't expect someone in an apartment complex not to use\nhis TV. We accept that some noise will come from our neighbors, but\nwe have some idea of what is a reasonable standard,'' Israeli said.\n\n   To the cell phone industry, however, leakage isn't the only\nproblem. Larson noted that more than 118,000 emergency calls are\nmade each day from cell phones. And what if a doctor in a theater\nmisses an emergency call because of a jammer?\n\n   Surreptitiously cutting off cellular telephone access is like\nsnipping off the burning tip of a cigarette because you object to\nsecondhand smoke, jammer foes say. ``The answer is etiquette,\neducation, making sure people are using their cell phones in ways\nthat don't invade other people's space,'' Larson said.\n\n   Larson's association and many of its member companies, including\ncell phone manufacturer Nokia and service provider U.S. Cellular,\nare pouring money into public education campaigns to encourage cell\nphone users to be more considerate.\n\n   The FCC has fielded enough queries about the legality of cell\nphone jammers that it issued a notice last year. In it, the agency\nwarns that jammers violate federal laws that broadly prohibit\ninterfering with licensed radio spectrum. Owning, manufacturing,\nmarketing, offering for sale or operating a cell phone jammer is\npunishable by an $11,000 fine and up to a year in prison for each\noffense, the notice states.\n\n   Stern warnings to the contrary, the agency has never seized a\nsingle jammer or prosecuted an operator to the best of his\nknowledge, said Richard Welch, associate chief of the FCC's\nEnforcement Bureau.\n\n   ``We haven't taken any actions because nobody has complained,''\nWelch said, adding that it was possible jammer users were simply\nflying under the FCC's radar.\n\n   Lemel agreed. When a cell phone doesn't work, he said, ``the\nfirst thing you think isn't, `I'm being jammed.'''\n\n     (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)  \n\n   It's not because they're not in use, if sales are any indicator.\nLemel says the United States is his firm's biggest market for cell\nphone blockers. And NetLine, Israeli says, also sells many devices\nin the States, though Europe is its largest market.\n\n   Both companies sell liberally in Latin America, the Middle East\nand Asia, where jammers are used for personal and corporate\nsecurity. For example, many South American banks jam cell phones to\nprevent robbers from guiding outside accomplices to mug people\nwho've just made large withdrawals, Israeli said.\n\n   Cell phone jammers are readily available on the Internet. Many\ncan be battery-powered and fit in a pocket or briefcase for people\nwho would like to enjoy a meal, movie or church service in peace.\n\n   A portable C-Guard sells for about $900 and can cover the area\nwithin a 450-foot radius. Lemel's company offers the $890 M2\nJammer, which comes in a briefcase and can block phones within a\nmaximum radius of 50 feet. It's advertised as ``ideal for the\nexecutive interested in keeping meetings and working lunches free\nfrom external distractions.'' Hubgiant of Taipei, Taiwan, sells its\nWAC1000 personal jammer, which has an operating radius of up to 30\nfeet, for $169. And Uptron of Lucknow, India, offers a full range\nof jammers with coverage ranging from 20 feet to over one mile.\n\n   Despite cellular industry fears, the majority of jammer sales\naren't to revenge-seeking Luddites, Israeli said. Most go to\nbusiness owners, government and police. Law enforcement officers\ncan use jammers to throw a net of silence over hostage takers.\nCorporations use jammers to protect trade secrets. Ahmadi said\nthree British hospitals evaluated the C-Guards in his theater\nbefore installing them to prevent interference with crucial medical\nequipment.\n\n   At least one company offers a technological alternative to\njamming, and others are working on them.\n\n   Zetron Inc., based in Redmond, Wash., manufactures a system that\ncan detect cell phones and warn users to turn them off. It can\ncover up to a 90-foot radius. BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., is\nworking on Q-Zone, a system that will turn off cell phones or\nsilence their ringers when they enter a protected space. It relies\non shortwave technology called Bluetooth that hasn't been widely\nadopted by cell phone makers and may not be on the market for\nanother three to four years. NetLine is developing a similar system\nthat will work with existing European digital cellular telephones,\nbut not American devices.\n\n   In some countries, jammers are gaining currency as a legitimate\ndefense against cell phone abusers. In Japan, Tokyo-based Medic\nInc. sold thousands of its Wave Wall jammers to restaurants,\nfuneral directors and others before the government limited their\nsale. Now jammers must be licensed for use in Japan, and used only\nin spaces such as live-performance theaters where cell phones are\njudged by the government to be a nuisance.\n\n   But even that's a victory, says Israeli, who thinks such uses\nhelp governments see that cell phone ``firewalls'' can serve a\nlegitimate market under controlled conditions.\n\n   ``Legislators and government bodies have not yet realized that\n(jammers) can fulfill a useful role in society,'' Lemel said. ``One\nof these days, they'll wake up to it.''\n","Headline":"\nCELL PHONE JAMMERS, ILLEGAL IN U.S., CAN CREATE SILENT ZONES \n","Text":["\n   (UNDATED) The incessant ringing was bad enough, but when patrons\nof the Whiteley Shopping Centre's cinema in London began answering\ntheir cellular telephones mid-movie _ shouting to be heard above\nthe dialogue _ Nasser Ahmadi knew something had to give.\n","\n   ``Some people were getting so angry that they were leaving the\ncinema,'' said Ahmadi, a consultant to Universal Cinemas\nInternational, which operates the multiscreen movie house. ``People\nwere asking why we didn't do something about it.''\n","\n   Across the globe, cell phones disturb plays, concerts and films.\nPhones ring out during funerals and weddings.
