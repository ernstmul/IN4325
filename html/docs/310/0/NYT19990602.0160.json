Times News Service   \n\n   Americans bought more than 58 million radios for the home last\nyear. In fact, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association\nreports that most homes have at least eight of them. If car radios\nare included, that number rises to 9 or 10 per home, with 82\nmillion sold annually, making radios easily the most ubiquitous\nconsumer electronics device in the nation.\n\n   The average price for the home radios purchased last year was\nabout $17. So why on earth is the Bose Corp. selling a clock radio\nfor $349 _ or $499 for the model with an integrated CD player? The\nanswer, Bose says, is that it sounds better than other radios _\nlots better. In fact, Bose calls it ``the world's best-sounding\nradio.''\n\n   It's hard to escape advertisements for the Bose Wave Radio, in\nmagazines and newspapers and on local television _ and of course on\nthe radio, where Paul Harvey, the pitchman, croons appreciatively\nabout the wonders of this little device. The basic clock radio has\nbeen on sale since the summer of 1993; the new version with CD\nplayer has been available only since February.\n\n   Curious about whether the Wave Radio sounds good enough to be\nworth an extra $332 (or an extra $482 for the CD model)? Bose more\nor less requires you to take it on faith, because for people who do\nnot live near one of the 57 Bose company stores nationwide, the\nonly way to buy a Wave Radio is by phone, mail or over the Internet\n_ direct from the company.\n\n   ``You have to have confidence,'' acknowledged Steve Kingsbury,\ngeneral manager of direct marketing for Bose. If you're not\nsatisfied, the company allows you to send it back within 30 days.\nBut buying direct from the company insures that the price will\nreally be $349. No Fourth of July discounts, no special deals from\nmail-order houses.\n\n   Amar Bose, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology who is the founder and president of the company, said he\nchose to sell the radio directly because he was certain that\nhigh-end audio-video stores would see it as a threat. ``Who wants\nto show something like this _ a $300 hi-fi system?'' he asked.\n\n   The sale of home radios actually increased by 5 percent last\nyear, suggesting that Americans, by and large, were not convulsed\nwith concern about the quality of the sound pouring forth from the\nlittle speakers.\n\n   The explanation seems to be that Americans generally are inured\nto radios and put them in the same class as refrigerators _\nsomething so taken for granted that you seldom think about it any\nlonger.\n\n   As a result, most people have forgotten, or never knew, that FM\nradio can actually be a high-fidelity source, capable of\nreproducing music with nearly the sonic range, or frequency\nresponse, of a compact disk. They have forgotten, or never knew,\nbecause nearly all of the radios Americans purchased last year and\nover the previous few decades were capable of reproducing only a\nnarrow slice of this musical range.\n\n   So to many people, the Bose Wave Radio seems like a new product\ncategory: a radio that sounds good. And while the Bose radio is not\nthe only one _ Cambridge Soundworks, among others, sells a similar\nproduct _ the Wave Radio is probably the best known.\n\n   The Bose Corp. makes high-fidelity speakers, and the company has\nreveled in producing unconventional products ever since introducing\nits first product, the Bose 901 speakers in 1968 _ the first\nsuccessful speaker that projected the music both forward, as\ntraditional speakers do, and against the rear wall to expand the\nsound field, producing room-filling sound.\n\n   Bose, an engineer and inventor, has also from the beginning\npursued a quest to produce rich, deep bass through engineering,\nobviating the need for the 12-inch woofers that have traditionally\nbeen the minimum prerequisite for satisfying, full-range bass. That\nhas made Bose speakers easier to place in the living room. And that\nhelped lead to the Bose Wave Radio. It produces far deeper bass\nthan its tiny, 2.5-inch speakers ought to be capable of.\n\n   But Bose said that when he introduced the product, ``I just went\non a hunch that people would want something that gives you the full\nbenefits of a hi-fi but be as simple as a refrigerator.'' And in\nfact, Bose is selling as many of these $349 radios as it can make,\nhundreds of thousands of them a year.\n\n   nn\n\n   Normally speakers that size are able to produce only a narrow\nswath of sound in the middle of the frequency range, where human\nvoice falls. If voices sound nasal, or tinny, it is largely because\nthe bass frequencies are missing.\n\n   These frequencies are not missing on the Bose Wave Radio. Bose\nsays it has solved the problem by designing a complex, twisting\nsound baffle that wends around for 27 inches, back and forth,\nthrough the body of the small tabletop radio, whose exterior\nmeasurements are only about 14 inches wide by 9 inches deep by 4\ninches high. Looking at a diagram of this ``wave guide,'' as Bose\ncalls it, brings to mind high-school biology class diagrams of the\ninner ear.\n\n   The wave guide works the same way a pipe organ does, noted\nWilliam R. Short, a Bose fellow. It uses a precise volume of air to\namplify the vibrations of the speaker cone. The vibrations of the\ncone vibrate the air in the baffle, too. ``It matches the motion of\nthe air with the motion of the speaker,'' Short said.\n\n   In practice, the wave guide seems to work. I've had a Wave Radio\nfor review for several weeks, and I've listened to FM radio and to\na variety of CDs I already knew to be sonically (as well as\nmusically) pleasing. And the clear, visceral impression is that the\nmusic is richer and fuller than anyone would normally expect from a\nradio, of all things _ especially one this size.\n\n   No, the Wave Radio does not produce thunderous bass that shakes\nthe cabinet doors. On the top end of the spectrum, the high treble\nthat comes from cymbals, bells, triangles and some strings sounds a\nbit muted. But the truth is, on most home radios you probably\nwouldn't even know that the high treble was there. And the bass\nwould be a mere suggestion, not an appreciable part of the music.\n\n   Accurate music production is not the result just of frequency\nresponse. Most full-range audio systems also play certain\nfrequencies at higher volumes than others, leading to overblown\nbass or harsh, strident treble. But the Bose radio manages to\nreproduce fairly smooth sound across the spectrum. I was not able\nto measure it, but the music sounded relatively uniform _ or\n``flat,'' using the jargon of the trade _ from low bass to high\ntreble.\n\n   The result is a radio that sounds quite pleasing _ surprisingly,\ngiven its size. It was also able to play at higher volumes than\nmost other small radios, without distortion, or ``clipping,'' from\nthe speakers.\n\n   The Bose Wave radio cannot compete with any serious stereo\nsystem with separate speakers and an FM tuner: housing both\nspeakers in one 14-inch cabinet greatly diminishes the stereo\neffect. But this is a clock radio with all the functions of one,\nincluding a snooze button. It is intended primarily for use in the\nbedroom or the kitchen, where high-quality sound is not usually\nfound.
