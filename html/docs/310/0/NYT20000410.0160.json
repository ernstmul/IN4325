After spending about 11 days at\nthis altitude, the craft is to take another downstep on its way to\nsettling in at a height of 31 miles for months of closeup\nobservations of the pitted, tumbling, rocky mass below.

But without irrefutable proof,\nastronomers refused to admit that it might be commonplace closer to\nhome. Now, sadly, they have that proof. The Milky Way is a chronic\ncannibal. It consumes other galaxies and makes their stars its own.\n(550 words)\n\n   SCI-FRUIT-FLY (Undated) _ The Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome\nwas just decoded, has attained vast prominence in human affairs\nbecause it is one of the principal model organisms studied by\nbiologists as a means of understanding the general design of life.\nBecause of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of\npeople overlap considerably. Their advocates, who call themselves\nfly people, are easily provoked into confessing that they think of\npeople as large flies that lack wings. And over the past 93 years,\nthe fly has a long and celebrated history in biology and genetics.\nBy Nichols Wade.

Now, some contend that\naggressive treatment, which can be painful and cause side effects,\nshould be used in almost all cases.

Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan\ninstitutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,\nusing remote sensing from satellites and aircraft and electronic\ntrackers on the ground to create a vastly expanded, instantly\naccessible record of the gorillas and their habitat in digital\nform.

In a recent symposium, an expert described\nhow the artist metaphorically conveyed some of the most\nrevolutionary and complex scientific theories of the age, from\nEinstein's special theory of relativity and Darwin's theory of\nevolution by natural selection to the premise that humans are the\nstuff of stars.
