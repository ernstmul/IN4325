FISHER    \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted\nunanimously Wednesday to approve the use of a drug, tamoxifen, to\nreduce women's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n   If the drug, which is already on the market, is approved for\nthis purpose, it will be a milestone in efforts to prevent cancer,\nsome experts said. Although it is intended only for women at high\nrisk of breast cancer, it would nonetheless be the first drug that\ncould prevent cancer in healthy people.\n\n   ``As far as I know, this is the first drug approved for the\nprevention of cancer,'' said Dr. Leslie Ford, the associate\ndirector for early detection and community oncology at the cancer\ninstitute.\n\n   Wednesday evening, the advisory panel unanimously recommended\napproval for a new drug for women with advanced breast cancer.\nOfficials say that the drug, Herceptin, made by Genentech, is\nintended for use by the estimated 30 percent of breast cancer\npatients who have a defective gene called HER2/neu that makes their\ncancer spread aggressively through the body.\n\n   Herceptin is not a cure, but has been shown in clinical trials,\neither alone or with chemotherapy, to delay the progression of the\ndisease.\n\n   The agency typically follows its advisers' recommendations.\n\n   Tamoxifen is already on the market as a treatment to prevent\nrecurrences of breast cancer in women who have had the disease.\nSince doctors can prescribe drugs for other than their approved\nuses, they could give tamoxifen to healthy women even without the\nFDA's approval. But approval of tamoxifen as a drug to reduce\ncancer risk would allow the company to advertise and market it\nwidely for this purpose and would mean that health insurance\ncompanies would be more likely to pay for it for women who have\nnever had cancer.\n\n   Supporters expressed delight that women would have a new avenue\nto prevent one of the diseases they dread the most. ``We're very\npleased,'' said Susan Braun, the president and chief executive of\nthe Susan G. Komen Foundation, an advocacy group for women with\nbreast cancer.\n\n   But tamoxifen is not a panacea, experts warn, and the 11-member\nadvisory panel said it did not yet have enough information to\ndetermine which women are at high enough risk of breast cancer to\nmake the drug's hazards, including potentially fatal blood clots as\nwell as cancer of the uterine lining, worth its benefits.\n\n   Critics say they fear that the drug will be overpromoted and\nthat more women may be harmed than helped.\n\n   ``The message we try to get across is that not everyone is at\nhigh enough risk to make this worthwhile,'' said Cindy Pearson,\nexecutive director of the National Women's Health Network. ``It\nisn't like putting iodine in your salt or chlorine in your drinking\nwater. Women have already died taking this drug,'' she said, adding\nthat it was still not clear that, in the long term, it would save\nlives.\n\n   Alan Milbauer, who is vice president for external affairs at\nZeneca Pharmaceuticals, the Wilmington, Del., firm that makes\ntamoxifen, said the company plans to advertise the drug directly to\nwomen in 1999, after first educating general practitioners about\nits use. Milbauer said tamoxifen costs $80 to $100 a month.\n\n   Dr. Robert Justice, who is acting director of the division of\noncology drug products at the FDA, said ``potentially tens of\nmillions of women'' could be candidates for tamoxifen. He said\nZeneca applied to market the drug for the prevention of breast\ncancer at the behest of the agency and the National Cancer\nInstitute and called the advisory committee's decision to recommend\nthat the drug be approved for this purpose ``courageous.''\n\n   Already demand for tamoxifen is starting to build. Dr. Barbara\nWeber, who directs the breast cancer program at the University of\nPennsylvania, said that ``more and more women are calling me,''\nasking about the drug and that other doctors have had the same\nexperience.\n\n   Cancer experts had long hoped that tamoxifen might prevent\nbreast cancer. Its biochemistry was promising, since it prevents\nthe hormone estrogen from stimulating breast tissue. ``It's holding\nup across the board _ in any setting where you get reduced exposure\nto estrogen, you get less breast cancer,'' Dr. Weber said.\n\n   For example, women who start menstruating late or who reach\nmenopause early are less likely to develop breast cancer. But the\nnotion of testing tamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative in\nhealthy women was controversial because it would mean exposing\nwomen to the known risks of the drug to provide a possibly elusive\nbenefit.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Nonetheless, the cancer institute went ahead, with a large study\ninvolving 13,388 women who had at least double the average risk of\nbreast cancer. Half took tamoxifen and the others took a placebo.\nThe institute ended the trial abruptly in April, six years after it\nbegan, announcing that it was unethical to continue because the\ndata had become so clear that women who took the drug were less\nlikely to develop breast cancer. Eighty-five women taking tamoxifen\nhad gotten breast cancer as compared to 154 women taking a placebo,\na 45 percent reduction.\n\n   But 33 women taking tamoxifen developed cancer of the uterine\nlining, as opposed to 14 of women taking the placebo; 17 women in\nthe tamoxifen group had blood clots in their lungs, as against 6\ntaking the placebo.\n\n   And the tamoxifen picture soon became muddied. While the cancer\ninstitute's study still awaits publication in a medical journal,\ntwo European groups published results from their own studies in the\njournal Lancet in July, and the data were not so encouraging. A\nBritish study of 2,471 women and an Italian study of 5,408 women\nfound no reduction in breast cancer risk in women who took\ntamoxifen.\n\n   Perhaps, many said, the European studies were too small to see\ntamoxifen's benefit. In addition, noted Dr. Ford, who directed the\ntamoxifen trial for the cancer institute, the women in the European\ntrials were at lower risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n   But, wrote Dr. Kathleen Pritchard of the University of Toronto\nin an accompanying editorial, ``The failure of these trials to\nconfirm the results of the U.S. study, however, casts doubt on the\nwisdom of the rush, at least in some places, to prescribe tamoxifen\nwidely for prevention.''\n\n   By that time, momentum was already building for the approval of\ntamoxifen for healthy women at increased risk of breast cancer. In\nApril, shortly after the U.S. tamoxifen study ended, officials from\nthe FDA, the cancer institute, and the U.S. tamoxifen study met and\ndecided that the agency should consider allowing Zeneca to market\ntamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative, Justice of the FDA said.\n``They were encouraged to submit an application to us as soon as\npossible,'' he added. Wednesday's meeting was the result.\n\n   The expert panel, headed by Dr. Janice Dutcher, a professor of\nmedicine at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was unhappy\nwith the wording of the agency's questions, which asked if\ntamoxifen should be approved as a way to ``prevent'' breast cancer.\nThat had not been demonstrated, the group said, noting that it\nremained possible that the drug merely staved off cancers that\nwould eventually occur. So it changed the works to ``reduce the\nrisk'' of breast cancer and voted unanimously to recommend approval\nfor that purpose.\n\n   Dr. Ford said that the cancer institute and its tamoxifen\nresearchers have been preparing for this day, developing a computer\ndisk that will be available to women and doctors and that can\ncalculate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer as well as\ncompare her risk to that of the women in the large tamoxifen study.\nThose who want the disk can order it through the cancer institute's\nclinical trials Web site, Dr. Ford said.\n\n   If Herceptin is approved, it will be the first genetically\nengineered drug for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.\n\n   Herceptin has not yet been tested in earlier-stage breast\ncancer, but some specialists said they believed it could also\nprevent or delay the spread of the disease.\n\n   Although Herceptin potentially delays tumor progression in less\nthan one-third of patients whose breast cancer has spread, or\nmetastasized, cancer specialists said it represents an important\nstep toward a new method of treatment. Unlike chemotherapy, which\nkills fast multiplying cells, healthy as well as cancerous,\nHerceptin targets a specific genetic alteration linked to the\ncancer. Thus Herceptin has relatively few side effects.\n\n   Dr. Debu Trepathy, director of clinical trials at the breast\ncare center of the University of California at San Francisco and a\nprincipal investigator of the drug, called the drug a breakthrough.\n``There is no doubt in my mind that this is the beginning of a\nwhole new wave of biological drugs that modulate the causes of\ncancer,'' he said.\n\n   Herceptin is a genetically engineered copy of an immune system\nprotein known as a monoclonal antibody. It was developed by\nGenentech Inc., based in South San Francisco, Calif., which is 67\npercent owned by Roche Holdings Ltd., of Basel, Switzerland.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Herceptin was recommended for the treatment of patients with\nadvanced metastatic breast cancer whose tumors produce excessive\namounts of a gene known as HER2, for human epithelial growth factor\nreceptor-2. When several copies of a HER2 gene exist in a cancer\ncell, excessive amounts of a protein are produced on the surface of\ncells.\n\n   About 25 to 30 percent of metastic breast cancer patients\nproduce too much HER2. In turn, too much HER2 often means the\npatient's cancer will spread faster and kill sooner than in\npatients producing smaller amounts of HER2. Patients in clinical\ntrials of Herceptin were screened using laboratory tests to\ndetermine who produced large amounts of HER2.\n\n   ``The ability to ask functional questions about cells, and about\nwhat causes a normal cell to become malignant, and then to\nintervene to fix what is broken, that has been the promise,'' of\nmolecular biology in cancer, said Dennis Slamon, director of the\nRevlon UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program in Los Angeles. ``HER2\nand Herceptin, in that context, represent to my mind the first\nreal-world realization of that hope,'' he said. Slamon was a\nprincipal investigator of Herceptin.\n\n   In clinical trials of patients with metastatic disease who had\nnot received chemotherapy, those treated with Herceptin and\nchemotherapy experienced tumor progression later than those treated\nwith chemotherapy alone. The median time to disease progression\nincreased from 4.6 to 7.6 months, or about 65 percent. About 28\npercent of women treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy did not\nshow tumor progression at one year, compared with 14 percent who\nwere treated with chemotherapy alone.\n\n   A second trial, of women who were not helped by chemotherapy,\nshowed that Herceptin alone delayed tumor progression to some\nextent in a fifth of the patients.\n\n   For most patients, the main side effect of Herceptin was a\nfever, treatable with Tylenol. In a minority, however, who received\nHerceptin along with a class of chemotherapy drugs called\nanthracyclines, the combination caused cardiac problems, such as\ncongestive heart failure. These effects typically ceased when the\ndrug was withdrawn.\n\n   ``It's a very big advance,'' said Larry Norton, medical director\nof the breast center at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer\nCenter. ``All by itself, it's definitely going to help a lot of\npeople, and it dramatically augments the Taxol effect,'' he said,\nreferring to a chemotherapy drug that has been particularly\neffective in breast cancer.\n\n   ``The key issue is not the efficacy, although that's very\nexciting,'' he said. ``The key issue is that this is the beginning\nof the whole new approach in the treatment of cancer.''\n","Headline":"\nFDA ADVISERS RECOMMEND 2 BREAST CANCER DRUGS \n","Text":["\n   An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted\nunanimously Wednesday to approve the use of a drug, tamoxifen, to\nreduce women's risk of developing breast cancer.\n","\n   If the drug, which is already on the market, is approved for\nthis purpose, it will be a milestone in efforts to prevent cancer,\nsome experts said.
