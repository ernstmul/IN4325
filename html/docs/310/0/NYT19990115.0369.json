The procedure, commonly referred\nto as LASIK, involves the use of an excimer laser. Typically,\ntreatment costs about $2,000 per eye.\n\n   But light, in one form or another, is also used in myriad other\nprocedures, many of which _ such as LASIK and other cosmetic\nsurgery _ are not covered by insurance.\n\n   Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are using ruby lasers that\nbreak up pigmented skin or dye to eliminate birthmarks, freckles\nand tattoos.\n\n   And at the Vein Center of Georgia, doctors use a machine called\na ``PhotoDerm,'' which relies on pulsating waves of light, to\nremove small ``spider'' varicose veins, discolorations and hair.\n\n   ``I think the No. 1 advantage is it's not painful,'' said Dr.\nMark Mittenthal, a vascular surgeon at the Vein Center. ``And we\nare able to truly customize the treatment because the settings\nchange on the basis of the pigmentation of an individual's skin.''\n\n   Diane Davis said she started going to the Vein Center for spider\nveins, but she decided to try the PhotoDerm for a birthmark about\nthe size of an orange on her leg.\n\n   ``I could never wear white hose,'' said Davis, 51, of College\nPark (Ga.). ``It would magnify that dark spot.''\n\n   After two treatments, the birthmark turned extremely dark,\nflaked off and vanished _ ``sort of like when you get a sunburn and\nyour skin peels,'' she said. ``No one would ever know it was there.\nI was truly amazed.''\n\n   In the dental field, most patients now find a laser lurking\nsomewhere near their chair.\n\n   At Garber's practice _ Goldstein, Garber, Salama & Gribble _\ndifferent lasers are used for different jobs. Carbon dioxide lasers\ncut away gum tissue. Argon lasers are used to cure new white\nfillings, bleach teeth and bond cavity-preventing sealants to\nchildren's teeth.\n\n   In addition, a new ``hard-tissue'' laser prepares teeth for\nrestorations. Although still not as good as a conventional\ndentist's drill, this laser is expected to be refined and become\nmore convenient in coming years.\n\n   ``In the future, we do believe the hard-tissue laser has\nenormous potential, enormous promise,'' Garber said.\n\n   Lasers, however, have had the biggest impact in the field of\nsurgery.\n\n   They were introduced in medicine about two decades ago after eye\nsurgeons discovered they were extremely effective in retinal\nreattachment.\n\n   And since then, lasers' ability to cut tissue precisely and\ncleanly has made them nearly as common as the scalpel in the\noperating room. ``We found that laser light was a source of energy\nwe could control much better and focus on very small spots,'' said\nMostafa El-Sayed, director of the Laser Dynamics Laboratory at\nGeorgia Tech. ``And we found that, unlike a knife, a laser carried\nno bacteria _ dramatically reducing the chance of infection.''\n\n   Lasers also cause less scarring and swelling, and often require\nfewer follow-up stitches. Procedures using lasers often need less\npostoperative time, which results in cheaper operations and faster\nhealing.\n\n   Lasers are now commonly used to vaporize cancerous tumors,\ncauterize ulcers and open blocked arteries. And as doctors become\nmore familiar with the technology, they become bolder in their use\nof light.\n\n   Emory Heart Center(Emory University (Ga.)), for example, is one\nof 14 centers nationwide chosen to evaluate whether ``punching''\ntiny holes in the heart via laser _ as an alternative to\nconventional bypass surgery, where new arteries are implanted to\nreplace clogged ones _ may prove the best treatment for patients\nwith intractable angina, associated with chronic chest pain.\n\n   The treatment, called transmyocardial revascularization, or TMR,\ncreates new channels in the heart to facilitate blood flow.\n\n   Dr. W. Morris Brown III, an Emory cardiothoracic surgeon leading\nthe study, said about 85 percent of the patients who have the\ntreatment get relief, although ``we don't completely understand the\nmechanisms that make this work.''\n\n   A laser is basically a beam of photons _ energized atoms _ that\nare focused into a stream or pulse of light that can be used to\ncut, melt or vaporize the material it hits.\n\n   But the nifty thing about lasers is that they have different\ncharacteristics depending on the type of crystal or gas used to\ncreate the photons. A ruby laser is different from a carbon dioxide\nlaser, which is different from an argon laser.\n\n   And each laser responds differently to the various types of\ntissue it encounters.\n\n   Think of a laser like a painter's brush: Not only does the\nartist have a spectrum of colors to mix and combine with the brush,\nbut each color he creates will react differently to the surface\nbeing painted: The same color will look slightly different on a\ncanvas, a woodcarving or stone sculpture.\n\n   That's why lasers are so effective, for example, in reattaching\nretinas. Light passes harmlessly through the eye's lens but melts\nretinal tissue, which is a different color and type than that of\nthe lens, reattaching it to the back of the eye.\n\n   That boundless potential is making researchers seek new ways to\nuse the tool.\n\n   El-Sayed, for example, is studying whether the laser could be\nused as a diagnostic instrument in detecting ear infections. Light\ncould be bounced into the ear, and depending on the ``fingerprint''\nof reflected light, physicians could tell exactly what type of\nbacteria was causing problems _ and the best course of treatment.\n\n   The same principle is being examined by other researchers who\nare studying whether lasers could be used in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of cancer. In particular, doctors are examining lasers'\neffectiveness in throat, brain and breast cancers.\n\n   Physicians are also examining lasers' effectiveness with other\nchronic illnesses, such as arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. In\na few studies, researchers have found that some lasers are able to\npass harmlessly through the skin, but relieve pressure at joints, a\n``type of light acupuncture,'' El-Sayed said.\n\n   All of it is wondrous to 83-year-old Townes, who said he has\nbeen fortunate enough not to need any health care that requires his\ninvention.\n\n   ``I'm really delighted that it turned out this way,'' he said.\n``You're pleased when you learn (lasers) are useful for a normal\nengineering function. But it's a very different feeling when you\nknow you've helped people in such a direct way.''\n\n   Diane Lore writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Let there be light.\n","\n   In dental chairs, doctors' offices and surgical wards, more\nmedical professionals are harnessing the power of light and lasers\nto diagnose and treat everything from cancer to cavities.\n","\n   ``I think the public thinks a laser is a laser is a laser,''\nsaid Dr. David Garber, an Atlanta dentist who routinely uses lasers\nin his practice. ``But it's really a multitude of different\ninstruments _ allowing doctors to have tremendous control over what\nthey want to do.''\n","\n   Lasers and other tools that emit light have become critical\ninstruments of mainstream medicine.\n","\n   Charles Townes, who won the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics for\npioneering uses for the laser, did not foresee such a bright future\nin health care for his invention, officially known as light\namplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\n","\n   Townes, a professor emeritus at the University of California at\nBerkeley, said he knew it would be useful in communications and\nastronomy, but he produced only one short scientific paper on its\npossible use in surgery in the 1960s.\n","\n   ``I simply didn't know enough about medicine to envision how\nuseful it could be,'' said Townes, a native of Greenville, S.C. ``I\nhad never heard of a detached retina _ so there wasn't much of a\nchance that I would predict that the laser could fix it.''\n","\n   At more than a dozen local vision centers, for example, lasers\nare being used to reshape the lens of the eye, allowing nearsighted\npeople to toss their eyeglasses.
