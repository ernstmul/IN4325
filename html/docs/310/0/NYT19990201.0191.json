KNOX  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n\n  \n\n   Boston scientists have abolished the mouse version of menopause,\nopening a new window on the mechanisms of female aging.\n\n   The researchers report Monday that they have engineered mice\nwhose ovaries grow viable eggs and secrete estrogen into advanced\nold age _ the mouse equivalent of human centenarians.\n\n   Dr. Jonathan L. Tilly of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led\nthe project, said his team is nowhere near trying the same thing in\nhumans and isn't sure whether that would even be a good thing. But\nthe genetically engineered mice offer ways to study what happens to\nfemale blood vessels, bones, brain cells, and other tissues when\none of the normal mainsprings of aging is suspended indefinitely.\n\n   ``To extend ovarian lifespan is unbelievable,'' Tilly said in an\ninterview. ``With sustained ovary function, we would expect various\norgan systems to benefit, and overall lifespan to be extended.''\n\n   The new mouse strain does not open the door to geriatric\nmotherhood, possibly because the aged animals lack the pituitary\nhormones necessary to sustain pregnancy.\n\n   However, Tilly and his colleagues hope their findings will lead\nto treatments to preserve fertility in women who undergo premature\nmenopause due to an inborn disease or cancer chemotherapy.\n\n   The researchers' main aim is to better understand\nmenopause-driven disorders so scientists can devise treatments to\nbenefit menopausal women. For instance, the ovaries secrete other\nsubstances besides estrogen that might affect aging.\n\n   ``This provides us with a model that will allow us to tease out\nthe molecular and cellular mechanisms of menopause, and beyond\nthat, the mechanisms that link menopause to the diseases of aging\nin women,'' added Dr. Frank Bellino of the National Institute on\nAging, which partially funded the research.\n\n   Dr. Wulf Utian of Case Western Reserve Medical School in\nCleveland, a leading menopause specialist, said the mouse strain\ncould help solve such enigmas as why some middle-age women have\nyouthful-appearing ovaries while those of others at the same age\nare shriveled.\n\n   ``This work has opened new vistas, but the end of the rainbow is\nstill far away,'' Utian said in an interview.\n\n   The mouse experiments are reported in the current issue of\nNature Genetics. They were carried out by Tilly and his colleagues\nat the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology at MGH along with\nStanley J. Korsmeyer of Dana Farber Cancer Center and co-workers at\nWashington University in St. Louis and the University of Maryland.\n\n   The group was able to arrest what had seemed an immutable law of\nmammalian nature, the inexorable depletion of ova or egg cells.\nOvaries in all mammals obey a strict genetic command that causes\nova to die at a steady rate throughout life until the supply is\ndepleted.\n\n   The ovaries of human fetuses contain several million eggs, but\nfor unknown reasons the number dwindles to about 1 million at the\ntime of birth. At puberty, girls have about 400,000 egg cells, but\nby menopause (age 51 on average), nearly none remain, even though\nonly one ovum is normally released from the ovary each month during\nthe 450 or so menstrual cycles a normal woman will have.\n\n   Because ova are the females' main source of estrogen, their\nexhaustion starts a chain of events linked to diseases as diverse\nas osteoporosis and dementia.\n\n   The MGH researcher said he doesn't ``want anyone to think this\nwill have immediate application in humans.''\n\n   ``This is the first time anyone has proved this can work, and if\nit can work in a mouse, perhaps it will in humans,'' he said. ``Now\nwe can ask the question for the first time: Do we even want to\nsustain ovarian function? We couldn't test that before.''\n\n   One potential problem is that perpetual estrogen output could\nraise the risk of cancer, just as current postmenopausal estrogen\nsupplements do for uterine cancer and possibly for breast cancer.\nSo far, the researchers have seen no cancers in their aged mice,\nbut relatively few animals have been studied.\n\n   Indications are that the geriatric mice maintain a strikingly\nyouthful character without evidence of harmful estrogen-related\neffects. Their uteruses resemble those of much younger animals\ninstead of the shrunken organs of normal aged mice.\n\n   The researchers were surprised to find that all it took to\nforestall the normal aging of ovaries was to disable a single\nmaster gene that controls the rate of cell death.\n\n   The gene, called bax, controls the rate of programmed cell\ndeath, a self-destruct mechanism scientifically known as apoptosis\nthat allows the body to rid itself of flawed or extraneous cells.\n\n   The researchers knocked out the bax gene in mouse embryos,\ncreating a gene defect that seemed to produce no harmful effects in\nthe animals later in life. In fact, they live longer than normal\nmice.\n\n   Egg follicles continued to develop in the ovaries of the\nbax-less mice as late as 22 months, ancient by mouse longevity\nstandards. However, the females did not become pregnant when caged\nwith male mice, which Tilly thinks is due to shutdown of sex\nhormones from the pituitary gland in the animals' brains.\n\n   When the researchers removed the eggs from their geriatric mice,\nthey found they were capable of being fertilized in the test tube\nand of growing into normal-appearing embryos.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   Boston scientists have abolished the mouse version of menopause,\nopening a new window on the mechanisms of female aging.\n","\n   The researchers report Monday that they have engineered mice\nwhose ovaries grow viable eggs and secrete estrogen into advanced\nold age _ the mouse equivalent of human centenarians.\n","\n   Dr. Jonathan L.
