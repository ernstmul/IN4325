Times News Service    \n\n   PARIS _ Scientists studying the heavens have long been bothered\nby the more mundane activities of other earthlings. They have fled\nto remote mountaintops to escape the light of the cities. They have\nadjusted their radio instruments to cope with the growing avalanche\nof television towers, cell phones, pagers, microwave ovens,\ngarage-door openers and the many other ground-based gadgets that\nemit radio waves.\n\n   But radio astronomers around the world say they cannot escape\nthe overhead ``pollution'' beamed down nonstop from the growing\nfleet of communications satellites.\n\n   At observatories like Nancay Radioastronomy Station in France\nand the famed Jodrell Bank in England, where pulsars were\ndiscovered, astronomers complain that the enormously powerful\nsignals emitted by the low-orbit satellites are drowning out the\nfaint whispers coming from the universe. And these manmade\nconstellations, they complain, are increasingly invading the\nfrequencies assigned to radio astronomy.\n\n   The satellites are a boon to communications companies and\ncustomers, allowing people to make calls from mobile telephones,\nsend faxes or transmit data from anywhere in the world.

The new zones of several hundred square miles would be like\nprotected ``parks'' in different parts of the world where satellite\nemissions or other broadcasts would be restricted or banned at\nfixed times.\n\n   Such quiet zones would be designated in remote parts of the\nworld with few customers so that satellite operators could turn off\ntheir emissions and radio astronomers could set up their\ninstruments there.\n\n   ``Radio telescopes are extremely sensitive and search for the\nmost subtle radio signals,'' said Michael Michalowski, a physicist\nwho attended the meeting. ``What's going on now is like a neighbor\nturning on a boom box while you are listening for the sound of an\ninsect.''\n\n   Among suitable candidates, which according to satellite records,\nare still reasonably ``radio quiet,'' are regions of Australia,\nChina and South Africa.
