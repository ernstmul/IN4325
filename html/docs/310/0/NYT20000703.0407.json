Collins.\n\n   Actually, those are just a few of Hendrie's many alter-egos _\nmen, women and children _ and if you listen long enough, it becomes\nplain the host is doing ALL the talking.\n\n   In other words, Hendrie is getting paid to carry on seamless,\nartful and often overheated conversations with himself. Hendrie's\nmeticulously crafted act reaches from a high-tech studio in Sherman\nOaks to 61 cities across the country.\n\n   By holding a telephone about seven inches from his face and\ndisguising his voice, Hendrie interviews Wireman, Gray, Bozell and\nall the rest during what's probably the most theatrical and\nsubversive program on the radio waves.\n\n   In fact, Hendrie's daily three-hour performance art piece\ncontinually draws uncomprehending callers who haven't figured out\nthe show's plain- as-day secret: that it's Hendrie and only Hendrie\nbehind the microphone.\n\n   The show hinges on those listeners from places like Tampa, Fla.;\nAtlanta; Culver City; and Long Beach who are angered at the crazed\nopinions Hendrie (as Gray or Bozell, etc.) puts on the air. Call it\ninteractive improv.\n\n   During a recent show, for example, Hendrie, playing the part of\nfavorite made-up character Colleen Christen Brewster, a Laguna\nBeach travel agent, argued that Darva Conger, the woman who married\nTV's multimillionaire and recently took her clothes off for\nPlayboy, was actually a pretty good role model for women.\n\n   ``She's a wonderful role model,'' Hendrie-as-Brewster said.\n``She gives me the strength to go on. She's a highly intelligent\nwoman who took control of her own life and called the shots.''\n\n   In a cramped control room at the Premiere Radio Network's\noffices on the fifth floor of a Ventura Boulevard high-rise,\nHendrie's producer, Mike Schaefer, fields calls.\n\n   ``Darva Conger's not a role model,'' a 34-year-old Manhattan\nBeach female insists. ``She's a gold digger.''\n\n   Schaefer hears and smiles: ``Those are the people we want on the\nshow _ the ones who don't understand.''\n\n   When a caller listening on a new affiliate in Tampa asks the\nscreener if it really is Hendrie doing all the voices, Schaefer\nkeeps the woman off the air but lets the cat out of the bag: ``It's\nPhil talking to himself.''\n\n   Hendrie, who rarely gives media interviews and never allows TV\ncrews in the studio, developed his act while working at Ventura\ntalk station KVEN-AM, where the biggest struggle involved getting\nlisteners to pick up their phones _ a major problem when you're\nrunning a call-in show.\n\n   ``So, I launched into uncharted territory and decided to make up\nmy own calls,'' Hendrie explained a few hours before his Thursday\nshow.\n\n   Born in Pasadena, the squat but powerfully built Hendrie spent\n15 years in music radio before moving into talk. He arrived in Los\nAngeles after handling morning-drive in Miami, starting at KFI the\nfirst time in 1989 before relocating to San Diego, Minneapolis and\nback to Miami. In the fall of 1996, he rejoined KFI and was moved\nin March into afternoon-drive against top-rated motor-mouth Tom\nLeykis on talk rival KLSX-FM (97.1).\n\n   ``No calls are set up,'' Hendrie explains. ``We don't pay people\nto call, and there are no other character voices. I've had George\nCarlin, one of the great mimics and comedians, offer to do a\ncharacter on my show. And for me not to get back to him on that was\npainful. I've politely declined all these offers because I learned\nthe hard way the only way I can be successful is to have complete\ncontrol.''\n\n   Unlike Howard Stern's legion of copycats, there have been no\nknown Hendrie imitators. Speaking of Stern whose business agent\nHendrie and Leykis, incidentally, share the superstar morning jock\nwas so taken by tapes of Hendrie that last year he visited the\nSherman Oaks studio to see for himself how it's done.\n\n   ``I was flattered he liked my work,'' said Hendrie, 47, who\nlives in Westlake Village with his wife and four stepkids. ``He\ncame to L.A., and we had lunch, and he watched the show. But if my\nact could spawn imitators, it would have by now. It's a tough act\nto rip off. They would have to do it better than me, and that's a\ntough thing to do. I know it angers Howard when people rip him off,\nbut for me it hasn't happened yet.''\n","Headline":"\nTHE MANY VOICES OF PAUL HENDRIE\n","Text":["\n   Phil Hendrie talks to himself for a living.\n","\n   Chances are, you know what that entails if you've ever flipped\nover to news-talk radio KFI-AM (640) any weekday from 4 to 7 p.m.\nand heard Hendrie jawing with such outrageous guests as Harvey\nWireman, Margaret Gray, Steve Bozell or R.C.
