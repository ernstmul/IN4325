Several tests later, Valle got the bad news that\nexplained his problem: He had prostate cancer.\n\n   ``I knew I had a prostate, but I wasn't even sure what it did,''\nValle said, recalling his reaction back in 1992.\n\n   After learning his options, Valle elected to have the cancerous\ngland surgically removed. But during surgery, it became apparent to\nthe doctors that the malignancy had already spread.\n\n   So Valle took the most drastic step possible to stop the cancer\nfrom spreading. He had himself surgically castrated to halt the\nproduction of testosterone, which is produced by the testes,\nbecause that male hormone fuels prostate cancer growth.\n\n   ``I want to shock men. I tell them, `If you don't pay attention\nto this disease early on, these are the things that can happen,'''\nsaid Valle, 65, of Phoenix, Ariz., a Cuban-born manufacturing\nexecutive.\n\n   This year, 184,500 American men will get the news that they have\nprostate cancer. Many will need to choose a treatment that may\nlengthen their lives but that also may end their sexual function\nand cause urinary incontinence.\n\n   Two-thirds of these newly diagnosed prostate cancer victims will\nbe over 65 years old. Most of the others will be in their 50s and\nearly 60s, at the peak of their working careers. A minority will be\nin their 40s, although some major medical institutions are\nreporting a spike in the number of younger men with prostate\ncancer.\n\n   ``It seems like we are seeing more younger patients with\naggressive disease in their 40s and 50s,'' said Dr. Howard Scher,\nchief of genito-urinary oncology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering\nCancer Center in New York.\n\n   This year, some 39,200 American men, many in hospices or at home\nand attached to morphine pumps, will die from a cancer that began\nin a gland a little larger than a golf ball. The prostate gland,\nnestled under the bladder adjacent to the rectum, produces the\nseminal fluid that carries sperm.\n\n   Prostate cancer contained in the gland itself isn't fatal. Death\ncomes if the cancer spreads beyond the prostate to bone, lungs,\nliver or brain.\n\n   Next to highly curable forms of skin cancer, carcinoma of the\nprostate will be the most diagnosed cancer in the United States\nthis year, according to the American Cancer Society. Nearly one in\nsix men will get the disease sometime in their lives.\n\n   In Texas alone, an estimated 11,900 men this year will learn\nthat they have prostate cancer, according to American Cancer\nSociety statistics, and 2,500 will die from it. Like the national\ntrend, prostate cancer is expected to be the most diagnosed\nmalignancy in Texas in 1998.\n\n   Most patients will die with the disease rather than from it\nbecause prostate cancer usually is slow growing. Nonetheless, it is\nthe second leading cancer-killer of men after lung cancer, killing\nin 1995 about 24.9 percent of men who got it, a death rate similar\nto breast cancer.\n\n   For mysterious reasons, there is a perplexing racial element to\nthe cancer. Mortality rates for black Americans with prostate\ncancer are more than twice as high as those for whites. Researchers\nspeculate that this may be caused by a combination of genetics,\ndiet and a reluctance to get medical checkups.\n\n   According to statistics compiled by the National Cancer\nInstitute, 150.3 non-Hispanic white men per 100,000 and 104.4\nHispanic men per 100,000 developed prostate cancer from 1990\nthrough 1995 compared with 224.3 black men per 100,000.\n\n   During the same period, 55 African American men per 100,000 died\nfrom the cancer, while the disease claimed the lives of 24.1\nnon-Hispanic whites per 100,000 and 16.8 Hispanics per 100,000.\n\n   Overall, the number of prostate cancer diagnoses has skyrocketed\nover the last 20 years. Medical scientists say the main reason is\nthe growing use of a new diagnostic tool known as the prostate\nspecific antigen (PSA) blood test.\n\n   A contributing factor is that men are living longer _ and\nprostate cancer afflicts older men more than younger men.\n\n   The average life expectancy of a non-Hispanic white American\nmale is almost 80 years, and the average diagnosis of prostate\ncancer is around 65 years. As a result, men are now being diagnosed\n15 to 20 years before their life expectancy is up.\n\n   ``They are around longer for the cancer to develop and spread,''\nsaid Dr. William Catalona, director of urologic surgery at\nWashington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\n   The combination of better early detection and longer life\nexpectancy has made prostate cancer ``a very significant\nhealth-care problem,'' said Catalona.\n\n   Prostate cancer rates have more than doubled between 1973 and\n1995 _ from 64.2 men per 100,000 to 137.2 men per 100,000,\naccording to the National Cancer Institute. The mortality rate\nduring the same period has shot up more than 20 percent.\n\n   Thanks to the PSA test, about 58 percent of new cases this year\nwill be caught in the early stages when the disease hasn't spread\nbeyond the prostate and the men are potentially curable. However, a\ncure is not certain even under the best conditions.\n\n   The most favorable scenario for a newly diagnosed patient is\nthat the disease is confined to the prostate, which is then either\nsurgically removed or radiated. Both treatments commonly result in\nimpotence or reduced sexual potency and urinary incontinence.\n\n   However, in about 20 percent to 30 percent of cases where a\ncancerous prostate gland is surgically removed, it later turns out\nthat cancer cells had escaped into the body before the surgery. The\nresult: The surgeon who ``got it all'' actually didn't _ and the\npatient later develops the cancer elsewhere in the body.\n\n   This stubbornness is why prostate cancer victims swapping\ntreatment experiences in Internet chat rooms have nicknamed the\ndisease ``the beast.''\n\n     MORE     \n\n   ``It may not grow as fast as breast cancer, but it is\nrelentless,'' said Dr. Michael Manyak, chief of urology at George\nWashington University in Washington, D.C.\n\n   The good news is that when confined to the prostate and treated,\nfive-year survival statistics are 100 percent. And over the past 20\nyears, the survival rate for all stages of the cancer combined has\nrisen from 67 percent to 89 percent, thanks to early detection and\ntreatment.\n\n   Survival starts to fall off after five years. According to the\nAmerican Cancer Society's most recent data, 67 percent of all men\ndiagnosed with the cancer survive 10 years while 50 percent survive\n15 years.\n\n   Early detection is imperative. By the time symptoms appear _\nlike Ralph Valle's frequent urination during the night, painful\nurination or pelvic pain _ the cancer may have already spread\noutside the gland, making it difficult, if not impossible, to cure.\nIf the disease spreads to the bones, death usually results within\n18 months to two years.\n\n   And death does not come peacefully.\n\n   ``Prostate cancer has the tragic distinction of being a death\noften protracted, always associated with severe pain, debilitation\nand psychological distress, and a death for which no effective\nintervention now exists,'' wrote Drs. Andrew Von Eschenbach and\nChristopher Wood of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, two\ntop prostate cancer researchers.\n\n   ``There is no cure for prostate cancer, once systemic\nprogression beyond the gland has occurred,'' they said in a 17-page\n``Agenda for Prostate Cancer Research.''\n\n   Men have been famously reluctant to talk about prostate cancer,\nmainly because the disease and its treatments often curtail sexual\nand urinary function.

There's no feelings or concerns\nexpressed,'' said Jerry Donohue, a prostate cancer patient from\nLong Island, N.Y.\n\n   That's beginning to change, thanks to publicity campaigns by\nwell-known prostate cancer patients. People like Bob Dole, Norman\nSchwarzkopf, Andy Grove and Michael Milken have told the public\nabout their own experiences with the disease in an effort to\nencourage more men to get tested.\n\n   Most recently, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Randy\n``Duke'' Cunningham, R-Calif., who in August had his cancerous\nprostate removed, held a press conference in front of the U.S.\nCapitol to urge men to get tested for prostate cancer.\n\n   ``Just as breast cancer is something every woman should know\nabout ... similarly, men I think should learn from Sen. Dole and\nfrom Congressman Cunningham, that if you will take the preventive\nsteps, if you will do the screening, if you will worry about\nwellness, you will live longer, and you will live healthier,''\nGingrich said.\n\n   One result of the touchy reticence surrounding the disease is\nthat men have been absent from the political wars that determine\nfederal funding for cancer research.\n\n   ``Men have not been organized into groups like the women have\nbeen,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the chairman of the Senate\nAppropriations Committee and a prostate cancer survivor.\n\n   The result: Federal funding for prostate cancer research has\nbeen dramatically less than funding for such other killers as AIDS\nor breast cancer. Breast cancer kills about the same number of\nAmerican women annually as prostate cancer kills of American men.\n\n   From this flows the reality that, compared to other major killer\ndiseases, less is known about prostate cancer. As a result, medical\npractitioners disagree over such basic issues as which treatment is\nbest.\n\n   ``Breast cancer is a pretty clean shot _ there is pretty much a\nconsensus about how to treat it,'' said Dr. Harold Freeman,\nPresident Clinton's top cancer adviser. ``Prostate cancer is not\nthe same.

Quite often, the patient\nwill die of something else.\n\n   The general rule of thumb among prostate specialists is that if\nthe man has a life expectancy of at least 10 years at diagnosis and\nthe cancer is suspected of being organ-confined, physicians will\ntry to cure the patient.\n\n   Lurking in the background will be such effects as impotence,\nincontinence and scarring of the rectum.\n\n   As Dr. Mark Litwin, of the UCLA Medical Center, puts it: ``Once\nprostate cancer is diagnosed and treated, the patient's life is\nnecessarily and permanently altered.''\n\n   The message from patients like Valle is that men should seek out\nas much information as possible about their disease and the side\neffects of treatments so they can make the best treatment\ndecisions.
