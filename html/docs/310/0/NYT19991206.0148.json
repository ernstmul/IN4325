Times News Service    \n\n   Opinions about cell phones in cars are running high these days.\nSales people, investors and soccer parents say they cannot manage\nwithout their electronic links. But the safety of talking on the\nphone in the flow of traffic is coming under question.\n\n   Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known on National Public Radio as Click\nand Clack, the Car Talkers, are so adamantly against the\n``scourge'' of chatting drivers that they are giving away bumper\nstickers saying, ``Drive Now Talk Later.'' In two months, according\nto Douglas Berman, their producer, 60,000 have been requested.\nApparently independent of this campaign, elected officials began\nstirring in two places last month, in one case as a result of a\nfatal crash.\n\n   Since the introduction of cellular phones in 1983, their use has\nbeen one of the fastest-moving and most visible changes in the\ncountry; the government estimates that by next year, there will be\n80 million cell phone users in the United States.\n\n   The AAA has been watching cell-phone legislation since 1992, but\ndespite outcries that there ought to be a law, no state or province\nhas so far outlawed wireless conversation while the driver's foot\nis on the accelerator. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation has likewise seen no looming state law.\n\n   Last month, an alderman in Chicago offered an ordinance that\nwould outlaw drivers' use of hand-held cell phones when the car was\nmoving on the road. In Pennsylvania on Nov. 3, a 2-year-old died of\ninjuries after her mother's car was struck by another whose driver\nsaid he did not see a stop sign while dialing. This caused State\nSen. Joe Conti to press again for a bill he introduced in the\nlegislature to outlaw drivers' use of handheld phones.\n\n   The little town of Brooklyn, Ohio (population 11,000), adjoining\nCleveland, is the only place on record as having enacted an\nordinance. Mayor John M. Coyne says that in 1966, Brooklyn adopted\nwhat he calls the country's first mandatory seat belt law. The\nmayor, who is leaving office on Jan. 1 after 52 years as an elected\nofficial, is proud of the new step.\n\n   Except for emergencies, the rule bans driver use of a cell phone\nheld in the hand while the car is in motion. It does not forbid use\nof no-hands devices or use while the car is parked.\n\n   The ordinance took effect in March. Up to Sept. 1, the mayor\nsaid, 150 warnings were issued, and since then, the police\ndepartment has issued 70 summonses, payable without a court\nappearance. A fine of up to $100 and court costs of $45 are\nprovided for, but Mayor Coyne said that fines of only $2 are being\nissued now.\n\n   The council acted after the police chief ``saw a guy using a\ncell phone strike a senior citizen,'' Coyne said. ``Fortunately, no\none was injured.''\n\n   Alderman Burton F. Natarus of Chicago introduced his legislation\nNov. 17. It, too, exempts emergency calls and does not rule out\nconversation if both of the driver's hands are on the wheel or the\ncar is parked. The fine would be $25, or $100 if an accident is\ninvolved.\n\n   ``Cell phones are part of our lives,'' Natarus said. ``However,\nwe must adhere to the rules of safety when driving an automobile.''\n\n   Every driver has personal experience of drivers acting unwisely\nwhile holding a cell phone. But it is more difficult to notice\nthose behaving similarly who have both hands on the wheel, using a\nno-hands model.\n\n   Two major bodies of research on this topic exist. On Feb. 13,\n1997, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study, made\nin Toronto, of links between collisions and car-phone use. The\nauthors studied 699 drivers who owned cell phones and had been\ninvolved in collisions resulting in substantial property damage.\nThe authors analyzed calls on the day of the collision and for the\nweek before, using billing records. The risk of collision was found\nto be four times higher during a call.\n\n   The study found it made no difference whether a driver used a\nhand-held or no-hands model, concluding it is the distraction that\ncounts.\n\n   The other major assessment, published by the National Highway\nTransportation Safety Administration in 1998, rounds up data, from\nstate police reports to scientific studies.

The\nstudy concluded in a general way that cellular phone use while\ndriving increased crash risk. ``What remains unknown is the\nrelative contribution of cellular phone use, per se, and\ncharacteristics of the involved drivers,'' the summary said, citing\nthe possibilities of ``greater propensity for risk-taking,''\nfatigue and inability to divide attention.\n\n   Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the safety agency, said that as a\ngeneral rule, ``distraction causes fatalities.''\n\n   The summary and study are on the agency's web site,\nwww.nhtsa.dot.gov.
