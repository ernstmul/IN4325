The U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency estimates that the Virgin Islands\nproduce 9.2 pounds of garbage per person per day, more than double\nthe U.S. mainland average. One reason is all the tourists who\nvisit, many making day trips from cruise ships. But the problem is\nthat the only landfill, Bovoni, can no longer absorb all the\ngarbage, and there's no money to clean up the mess. Why? Because\napparently the Virgin Islands is nearly broke. As a result of\nhurricane damage, declining tourism revenue and mismanagement, the\nVirgin Islands is saddled with a $1.2 billion debt, a stupefying\nsum for a population of just over 100,000.
