And some of them will.\n\n   But others are getting bigger and heavier, as designers cram\nthem with advanced features that might almost make you forget to\nphone home.\n\n   Now that half of us have computers at home and the Internet is\npart of our way of life, it's not enough for cell phones to be just\nphones.\n\n   People need ``smart phones'' capable of exchanging data with\ntheir desktop machines and even communicating over the Internet.\n\n   At least, this is what the phone makers think. So they're\nchurning out a lot of high-powered hardware that could give your\nbriefcase a higher IQ than your brain.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   One of the smartest and biggest portable phones comes from the\nFinnish firm Nokia (www.nokia.com). Their 9000IL Communicator isa\ncell phone that wants to be a laptop.\n\n   The telephonic face of the device flips open to reveal a cramped\nbut serviceable keyboard and a small black-and-white liquid crystal\nscreen. From here you can keep track of your appointments, type\nnotes, and send faxes.\n\n   And as you'd expect, the Communicator has address book software\nthat links up nicely with the cell phone. Just look up the name of\nsomeone you need to call, press a button, and the Communicator\ngives that person a ring.\n\n   The Communicator also boasts full-service Internet access _ or\nas full service as you can get with a slow, wireless modem. If you\nalready have an account with an Internet service provider, you can\npeck your way through a rather gnarly set-up procedure, and wind up\nwith a device that will collect your e-mail, send replies, and even\ndo a bit of Web surfing.\n\n   You wouldn't want to spend much time browsing on the\nCommunicator, with its small monochrome screen and tiny keyboard.\nBut the device has its uses.\n\n   It works well enough to let you download news headlines, for\ninstance. Or you could pop over to the MapQuest Web site and get\ndriving directions to your next appointment.\n\n   Of course, by the time you download them, using a modem with a\ntop speed of 13,200 bits per second, it'd probably be easier to\nfind out by calling instead.\n\n   All this comes in a package that weighs about a pound. Carry\nthis in your suit jacket and you'll be walking sideways. Then\nagain, the reduced weight of your wallet may compensate _ the\n9000IL goes for around $700, with cellular activation.\n\n   But tuck the Communicator in a briefcase or purse, and you've\ngot an acceptable laptop substitute for light-duty road trips.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Soon, you'll be able to get your hands on a device that does\nmuch the same stuff as the Nokia Communicator, but which will fit a\nlittle more comfortably in a pocket.\n\n   That's because cell phone maker Qualcomm (www.qualcomm.com) has\nteamed up with 3Com (www.3com.com), maker of the popular Palm Pilot\nelectronic organizers. The result is the PDQ, a phone with a\nbuilt-in Palm Pilot.\n\n   Judging by a prototype we've seen, the PDQ is a sleeker, lighter\nalternative to the Nokia phone. It's been cleverly designed with a\nthin phone keypad that flips down to reveal a standard Palm Pilot\ndevice.\n\n   Qualcomm's PDQ will have a strong advantage over rival products\nwhen it comes to market. There are more than 3 million Palm Pilot\nusers who are already comfortable with that pen-operated device, so\na PDQ will feel like coming home.\n\n   In addition, there are lots of auxiliary software programs\ndesigned especially for Palm devices, as well as Web sites that\nhave created special content for the new Palm VII wireless Web\nsurfing device. All this stuff will work with the PDQ as well.\n\n   Still, the PDQ can't match the crowd-pleasing proportions and\nlight weight of a Palm Pilot. Just having to include a hefty\nbattery to power both cell phone and Palm device turns the PDQ into\na brick. A small, light, rather pretty brick, to be sure, but not\nthe easiest device to tote.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   The engineers at Motorola (www.motorola.com) opted for a\ndifferent approach _ less brains, but also less strain.\n\n   Like Qualcomm, they decided to add an existing pocket computer\nto one of their phones. But Motorola picked the smallest, simplest\ndevice of its kind _ Franklin Electronics's Rex (www.franklin.com)\npocket organizer.\n\n   The Rex is far less sophisticated than a Palm. You can't enter\ntext by writing on the screen with a pen, or download new software.\nAll the Rex will do is store your address book, appointments, and\nother such housekeeping data. Attach the Rex to a computer, upload\nthe data into it, and slip it into your shirt pocket.\n\n   Motorola bought Starfish Software (www.starfish.com), the firm\nthat made the underlying software for the Rex. But then they got\nreally clever. Instead of designing a new kind of cell phone with a\nRex built in, they designed a clip-on device that lets you attach a\nnew version of the Rex to one of Motorola's ultra-small StarTAC\nflip phones.\n\n   It's called the StarTAC Clip-On Organizer and it sells for $250,\nnot including phone. A StarTAC phone will run around $300 or so\nwith activation.\n\n   It won't surf the Internet or check your e-mail, but it will\ndial any phone number in the Rex address book at the touch of a\nbutton. It has limited data entry features that let you add more\nnames, numbers, or appointments.\n\n   And the Clip-On Organizer lets you keep all this important data\nright where it will do the most good _ clipped to the side of a\nphone so small you could lose it in a well-stuffed purse.\n\n   Even with the Clip-On attached, the Motorola weighs only about 6\nounces _ by far the lightest of this trio.
