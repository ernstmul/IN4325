There are keyboard, mouse, and printer connections,\nand probably a link to the corporate network or the Internet.\n\n   Take a good look, because in a few years many of those wires\nwill likely be gone. Keyboards and mice will invisibly broadcast\ntheir commands to the computer. The computer will communicate with\nthe printer in the same way. In many businesses, the corporate\nnetwork will be completely wireless. Even Internet service will be\nbroadcast to the computer, at speeds rivaling today's high-speed\ndata wires.\n\n   Get ready for a wireless world, where electronic devices of\nevery type _ laptops, palmtops, PCs, even cars _ talk to each other\nwithout any sort of physical hookup. New data broadcasting systems\nalready are on drawing boards, or beginning to appear in new\nproducts. When all of these new systems are finally in place, a\npower cord may become the only wire many of us ever need.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Imagine being in a meeting, your laptop on the table in front of\nyou. Suddenly you realize that you forgot to bring a vitally\nimportant document. But just as the shock hits you, a message pops\nup on your computer screen: ``Never mind. I brought it.''\n\n   It's your business partner, seated in front of her laptop, 10\nfeet away. She saw the look on your face, guessed the reason, and\nfired off a message to ease your mind.\n\n   Of course, she might have typed: ``Didn't YOU bring it?'' It\ndoesn't matter. The important thing is how two people sitting 10\nfeet apart can send messages to each other's computers.\n\n   It's possible thanks to Bluetooth, a new technology that'll\nbegin appearing in electronic devices later this year. Bluetooth is\na short-range radio data networking system that enables devices to\ntalk to each other at speeds approaching 800,000 bits per second\nover distances of up to 30 feet.\n\n   It might seem absurd to design a broadcasting system with such\nshort range. But consider the distance between a keyboard or mouse\nand a computer, or the distance between the computer and the\nprinter. Bluetooth was designed to link all of these devices to one\namother without ever having to plug in a wire.\n\n   Says Mike McGuire, a wireless networking analyst at the research\nfirm Dataquest: ``It's going to be very cool for a lot of people.''\n\n   Bluetooth could also allow quick data connections between all\nkinds of electronic devices. A Bluetooth chip in a car, for\ninstance, could allow the driver to pump gas and drive away; the\nBluetooth-equipped pump would ``talk'' to the car and arrange\npayment. Add Bluetooth to a palmtop computer or cell phone, and\nthere'd be no need for a credit card. Your chip would just\nbroadcast the data to a chip in the store's cash register.\n\n   ``If Bluetooth evolves the way we think it will, it'll be a very\nubiquitous technology,'' says Jeff Clark, program director for\ntechnology development at IBM Corp.'s Personal Systems Group, based\nin Raleigh, N.C.\n\n   It's hard to exaggerate the tech industry's eagerness to bring\nBluetooth to market. Since the technology was first proposed in\n1997, more than 1,800 of the world's top hardware and software\nmakers have banded together to create a global standard to ensure\nthat all Bluetooth products will be compatible.\n\n   Companies ranging from IBM to a tiny British start-up, Cambridge\nSilicon Radio, are designing Bluetooth chips and the software to\nmake them work. Wireless titan Motorola has begun making Bluetooth\ndevices that can be plugged into the PC Card slots of existing\nlaptops, or installed in automobiles at the factory. International\nData Corp. recently predicted that nearly 450 million devices\nworldwide will use Bluetooth by 2004.\n\n   But Bluetooth won't catch on overnight. As a network technology,\nit faces the standard chicken-and-egg problem. Bluetooth is of\nlittle use until millions of people have it, but those millions\nwon't buy it until other millions already own it.\n\n   Meanwhile, the system suffers from a rather ironic technical\nproblem: Bluetooth signals may be scrambled by signals from a more\npowerful wireless networking system, one that could be used to link\nall of the computers in an office or home.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Nobody's coined a clever name for this networking system; it's\nsimply called by its technical name, IEEE 802.11. But this\ntechnology, which is already widely available, offers ordinary\npeople a simple alternative to costly and confusing wire-based\nlocal area networks, or LANs.\n\n   By adding 802.11 network transceivers to a group of computers,\nthey can all begin talking to one another at speeds of up to 11\nmillion bits per second. That compares to the 10 million bits per\nsecond found in many wired office LANs.\n\n   Companies with wired networks have no reason to switch to\n802.11, especially since upgraded network hardware now allows\ntransmission speeds of 100 million bits or even 1 billion bits over\nwired networks. But a company setting up a new office might use\n802.11 to create a quick, cheap wireless LAN. And homeowners with\nno desire to string ethernet wire all over the house might find\n802.11 a happy alternative.\n\n   Apple Computer Inc. has already staked out the home networking\nmarket. The company's AirPort wireless LAN system uses the 802.11\nstandard to let a houseful of Macintosh computers communicate\ncordlessly at distances of up to 100 feet. On the PC side, a number\nof companies, including Boston's Zoom Telephonics Inc., are making\nadd-on 802.11 adapters for home and business use.\n\n   It's been a tough sell so far.\n\n   ``The market did not take off as fast in 1999 and even 2000 as\nwe had anticipated,'' admits Zoom spokesman Larry Hancock. He\nblames an upgrade in the 802.11 software standard that boosted its\nspeed but caused potential buyers to wait for the dust to settle.\n\n   Hancock now expects surging demand for 802.11 products, based on\nhis company's estimate that more than a quarter of all American\nhomes now have two or more machines and thus an incentive to hook\nthem up.\n\n   Unfortunately, 802.11 and Bluetooth don't always get along. Both\nservices use the same general region of the radio spectrum, but\n802.11 signals are far more powerful than Bluetooth waves. As a\nresult, 802.11 networks can sometimes disrupt Bluetooth signals.\n\n   Engineers are working the problem at both ends, looking for ways\nto make the two systems play nicely together.\n\n   ``That's a major design challenge for some of the guys,'' says\nDataquest's McGuire. And one that'll put a damper on the market for\neither Bluetooth or 802.11 _ or both.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   Meanwhile, there's another major wireless technology on the\nhorizon, spurred by demand for high-speed Internet access. Millions\nof Americans still can't get access to high-speed cable modem or\nDSL telephone service. So a number of companies are moving to bring\nthem fast Internet service via the airwaves.\n\n   Martin Cooper helped invent the cellular phone when he worked\nfor Motorola. Now Cooper is chairman and CEO of ArrayComm Inc.,\nwhich has designed a cellular-type system called iBurst that can\ndeliver megabits of digital data to mobile computer users or\nstay-at-home types.\n\n   ``We don't do voice,'' says Cooper. ``The system is designed\nspecifically for the Internet. . . . We're using all of the\nbandwidth for data.''\n\n   That's one reason the iBurst system can pump data so much faster\nthan the 9,600 or so bits per second provided by today's cell phone\nmodems.\n\n   iBurst divides an area into multiple cells, each with a total\ndata capacity of 40 million bits per second. The amount available\nto each user varies by the number of users logged on to a cell at\nany given time. In heavy-demand areas, more cells can be added to\nboost available bandwidth. And because the system uses the cellular\napproach, subscribers aren't tied down to a single location.\n\n   Cooper said the service isn't intended to be used by someone\nmoving quickly, such as a commuter train passenger. But it would\nenable a laptop user to go from his home to the public library and\ninstantly get high-speed Web access when he arrives. The system\nwould also enable a new generation of cell phones that could easily\ndownload videos or music recordings for later use.\n\n   Cooper believes his system could make a profit while charging\nconsumers just $25 a month. But for now, iBurst remains vaporware,\nconfined to ArrayComm's San Jose labs. It'll cost billions to\ndeploy such a system nationwide. But at least one major corporation\nthinks it can be done. In April, Sony Corp. invested $6 million in\nArrayComm. Then, in June, the FCC granted the company a trial\nlicense to test its service in San Diego next year. If it works\naccording to plan, Cooper hopes to deploy iBurst in 100 US cities\nby 2004.\n\n   For people who need Internet speed but not mobility, the\nsolution could be MMDS, or multipoint multichannel distribution\nservice. Basically it's broadcast Internet, with high-speed data\nstreams radiated from towers scattered all over a city. Customers\ninstall receiver antennas similar to those used by satellite-TV\nsubscribers, and instantly get access to 1 million bits of data per\nsecond.\n\n   The wireless phone company Sprint is a leading proponent of\nMMDS, and has deployed the service in Phoenix and Tucson, where\nconsumers pay $40 a month.\n\n   Evan Conway, vice president of marketing and product development\nat Sprint's broadband wireless group, says 5,000 Phoenix residents\nhave signed up since May, even though the company has not\nadvertised the service. Conway credits word of mouth as well as\n``broadband envy,'' an ailment that afflicts Internet users who\ncan't get cable modem or DSL service.\n\n   WorldCom Inc., Sprint's erstwhile partner in a merger recently\nblocked by the federal government, is conducting its own MMDS trial\nin the Boston area. If the system pans out, customers won't need to\nwait for the phone or cable company to plug them into the Internet.\nAnd if they add Bluetooth and an 802.11 wireless LAN, they won't\nneed to plug in much of anything.\n","Headline":"\nFIRMS MOVE US TOWARD WIRELESS WORLD \n","Text":["\n   Look in back of any computer and you'll see a bird's nest of\ntangled wires.
