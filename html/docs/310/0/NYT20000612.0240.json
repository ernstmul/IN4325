Story will include how\nvaccine has been received in the year it has been approved. By\nHolcomb B. Noble.\n\n   SCI-LIFE-ORIGINS (Undated) _ Everything about the origin of life\non earth is a mystery, and it seems the more that is known, the\nmore acute the puzzles get. By Nicholas Wade.\n\n   (With graphic.)\n\n   SCI-STARS-COLLIDE (Undated) _ With most of the universe being\nempty space, astronomers once thought the chance of stars colliding\nwas roughly once in an eternity. But in recent years, astronomers\nhave realized that collisions are not uncommon within dense\nclusters of stars. ``We believe there are several hundred every\nhour somewhere in the universe,'' said Dr. Michael Shara, curator\nof the astrophysics department at the American Museum of Natural\nHistory. By Kenneth Chang.\n\n   (With graphic.)\n\n   SCI-HOMOCYSTEINE (Undated) _ Recent evidence has implicated\nelevated blood levels of homocysteine, an unhappy byproduct of\nnormal metabolism, in conditions ranging from miscarriages and\nbirth defects to strokes, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders\nthat afflict older people, including osteoporosis and presbyopia,\nthe eye changes that force the middle-aged to acquire reading\nglasses. And since hostility and stress raise blood levels of\nhomocysteine, it may explain why these emotional states are linked\nto heart attacks. By Jane Brody.\n\n   SCI-SEA-DRAGON (Undated) _ Update. With one week to go before\negg-hatching time, Mr. Mom, the pride of the Long Beach Aquarium of\nthe Pacific, was set to become the first captive weedy sea dragon\nin the United States to give birth successfully. Sea dragons always\nbreed through the male, but rarely in captivity. But last Tuesday,\nMr. Mom could fight the odds no longer. Lethargic and weak, the sea\ndragon died, leaving premature hatchlings still attached to their\negg sacks.

And now their\ndefoliating skill is being put to constructive use. Large flocks\nare being deployed in woods and fields from Florida to California\nto help reduce forest fire danger, cull thick brush without\nhazardous herbicides or smoke-belching mowers, and protect native\necology by devouring invading foreign weeds that have no natural\nenemy on American shores. By Andrew C. Revkin.\n\n   (With photo.)\n\n   SCI-NEANDERTHALS (Undated) _ Questions of Neanderthal\nfood-gathering behavior have long divided paleontologists. But an\ninternational team of scientists reported Monday that new chemical\ntests of 28,000-year-old Neanderthal bones may have settled the\nissue. The tests revealed that these now-extinct members of the\ngenus Homo lived almost exclusively on animal protein and so must\nhave been accomplished hunters. ``This research puts an end to the\nargument about whether the Neanderthals were primarily\nscavengers,'' said Dr. Erik Trinkaus, an anthropologist at\nWashington University.

By Emily Yellin.\n\n   SCI-BREASTCANCER-DENIAL (Undated) _ Though all cancers provoke\ndenial, there is something about breast cancer that drives some\nwomen into such extreme denial that when they first come to see a\ndoctor, tumors are literally growing out of their breasts. The\nliterature on the subject is massive and has been accruing for at\nleast thirty years. Exactly what provokes this response is not\nclear, although studies show that fear of disfigurement,\ndependency, death plays a big role. A 1991 study of over 2000\nNigerian breast cancer patients, for example, showed that fear of\nmastectomy was the most common reason for extreme delay in\npresenting to a doctor.
