Times News Service   \n\n   Through a rare glimpse inside the human brain, a team of\nAmerican and Swedish scientists reported Thursday that they have\ndiscovered the generation of brain cells in adult humans for the\nfirst time, opening an important area of investigation into\npossible new treatments for such debilitating neurological\ndisorders as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.\n\n   The finding is one of a series of recent discoveries that have\noverturned years of conventional wisdom about the human brain:\nthat, after birth, once brain cells died off they could never be\nreplaced. In one such finding last spring, scientists reported\nsubstantial new cell growth in the brains of developing children\nunder age six.\n\n   Now with the discovery in adults that cells are continually\ndividing and producing mature new cells, the potential arises that\nthis regeneration may be used to mend a brain damaged by disease,\nor to treat a disease caused by a damaged brain.\n\n   ``The door has been opened,'' said Dr. Fred Gage, the team\nleader, at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla,\nCalif, where the research was conducted in conjunction with\nSahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. It will be published in\nthe November issue of the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n   Gage cautioned that much more research is needed to learn\nwhether new cell creation can be put to work. But, he said, ``the\nnew research should prove interesting.''\n\n   The new growth was discovered in the hippocampus, a center of\nlearning and memory in the brain. Dr. Bruce McEwen, a\nneurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York, called the\ndiscovery an ``exciting development _ the isolation of a specific\npart of the human brain where you actually caught a glimpse of new\ncells being produced.'' McEwen and Dr. Elizabeth Gould of Princeton\nUniversity published findings last March on the discovery of\nneurogenesis, as brain cell growth is called, in adult marmoset\nmonkeys. Gage and others had previously recorded it in rodents.\n\n   The new study was done in post-mortem brain tissue taken in\nautopsies on five cancer patients at Sahlgrenska Hospital. In a\nrange of between three weeks and two years before their deaths, the\npatients _ ages 55 to 70, in both early and advanced stages of the\ndisease _ were given injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a\nchemical marker, or tracer to help determine later what was\nhappening in the hippocampus. This chemical-tracing technique is\nnow often used in cancer patients to determine whether malignant\ntumors are proliferating, which prompted the Gage team to use it to\nsearch for healthy cell production.\n\n   After the patients died, the researchers used advanced imaging\ntechniques to find the markers, and confirmed that undeveloped\nprimitive cells were in fact dividing and continuing to divide, and\nwere producing new mature neurons as well. They also found\nindications that this process continues until death. It is not\nclear whether these primitive progenitor cells are actually stem\ncells, which have a powerful capacity in the formative stages of\nbrain development for generating neurons that have a wide variety\nof functions, or whether their capacity is more limited.\n\n   Dr. William Greenough, a neuroscientist at the University of\nIllinois at Urbana-Champaign, called the Gage team's work ``\nincredibly clever.'' ``It provided science its first real\nretroactive look at a live human brain in the process of creating\nnew cells,'' he said. ``And because of the presence of the\nbromodeoxyuridine markers in the DNA, the conclusions are\nabsolutely credible.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   McEwen, like Gage, pointed out that future projects will have to\ndetermine the precise functions of these new mature brain cells. In\ngeneral, neurons play a wide range of roles in directing the\noperations of the body and the mind. Scientists still do not know\nwhen they are produced, why they are produced or how long they can\nsurvive.\n\n   The conventional thinking that humans could not grow new brain\ncells was based on the lack scientific evidence: no one would\nchoose to cut open the brain of a living person to prove it. But 30\nyears ago, a Purdue University neurobiologist, Dr. Joseph Altman,\nfirst reported cell birth in the hippocampus of adult rats. Because\nof the strength of the thinking of the day his work was ignored.\nThen in the '80s Dr. Fernando Nottlebohm at Rockefeller found that,\nin the brains of adult birds that learned new songs to attract new\nmates, new cells were being created. When he tried to push the\nnotion that the adult brain in animals and humans could potentially\nform new neurons, colleagues dismissed the notion as borderline\nfantasy.\n\n   But in the 1990s, with one animal study following another, the\nrace was to determine why the adult human brain could not perform\nas effectively in this manner as those of rats, mice, tree shrews\nand monkeys.\n\n   Before his collaboration with the Swedes, Gage and his group\nfound that if they enhanced the living environments of the mice _\nby giving them more space, more toys and fellow mice to play with _\nthe mice produced more new brain cells and performed better in a\nseries of behavioral tests.\n\n   This, Gage and others said in interviews Thursday, indicates\nthat there may be a way to manipulate the new cell growth in humans\nas well and make some difference in their physiology and brain\nfunction. ``We have to try to determine whether we might be able to\nhave some positive control over how the human brain cells divide,''\nsaid Gage. ``Once you know the chemicals and modulators that\ncontrol division, you can imagine that under disease or trauma\nconditions you might be able to control with beneficial results.''\n\n   The scientists emphasized that the hippocampus is one small area\nof the cerebral cortex where a vast number of brain functions\noccur. But it is the area where cell loss occurs in Alzheimer's\npatients, so its importance is real. Why this disease, and other\nneurological disorders, would occur despite the creation of new\nneurons replacing the old is one of the many questions now to be\ninvestigated.\n\n   An editorial in Nature Medicine said the discovery ``opens the\npossibility of autologous repair and regeneration'' in the brain.\nIt noted that Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and\nAlzheimer's disease all share a gradual loss of certain categories\nof neurons, and that ``these losses might reflect not only the\ninsult that causes the neurons to die, but a failure of an\notherwise expected regeneration that ordinarily repairs the loss.''\n\n   Last spring William Shankle, a neurologist at the University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, reported in the Journal of Theoretical Biology\non his analysis of hundreds of autopsies studied in Boston by J.L.\nConel in the 1940s and 1950s: Shankle said the studies indicated\ntremendous growth in the number of cells in a child's brain from\nbirth to age 6: adding some 400 billion. To him, that phenomenon,\ncoupled with the Gage study, indicates that new cell growth may\nwell be found in other areas of the adult brain outside of the\nhippocampus.\n\n   Shankle said experimentation might now begin with attempts to\nuse the newly created hippocampus cells in treating asphyxia,\ncaused by oxygen deprivation to hippocampus brain cells in drowning\nor smoke-inhalation victims or to treat some forms of memory loss.\n\n   Gage added: ``What may be as important as a new use for\ntherapeutic medicine may be a whole new way of thinking about how\nhealthy humans may respond or be made to respond to interactions\nwith our environment and improve or alter our contact with it.''\n","Headline":"\nADULT HUMANS CAN GENERATE NEW BRAIN CELLS, RESEARCHERS FIND \n","Text":["\n   Through a rare glimpse inside the human brain, a team of\nAmerican and Swedish scientists reported Thursday that they have\ndiscovered the generation of brain cells in adult humans for the\nfirst time, opening an important area of investigation into\npossible new treatments for such debilitating neurological\ndisorders as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.\n","\n   The finding is one of a series of recent discoveries that have\noverturned years of conventional wisdom about the human brain:\nthat, after birth, once brain cells died off they could never be\nreplaced.
