Times News Service    \n\n   The trouble began when Bobbie Gallagher noticed that her\n2-year-old daughter was behaving strangely, obsessively spinning\nand scrupulously setting her toys in rows. Alanna Gallagher turned\nout to have autism, a rare neurological disorder of unknown cause.\n\n   So did Alanna's little brother. So did about 40 other children\nwho lived in the Gallaghers' town of Brick, N.J., near the\nseashore.\n\n   The parents in Brick were alarmed. On average, 1 child in 500 is\nautistic; in the town, the figure is about three times that.\n\n   But what does it mean? Does Brick have toxic chemicals in the\nwater, pollutants in the air?\n\n   The problem, scientists say, may be impossible to resolve. It\nwas yet another instance of a phenomenon that makes many\nstatisticians shudder. It was a disease cluster _ the Boy Who Cried\nWolf of epidemiology.\n\n   Every time a disease cluster turns up, communities worry,\nscientists scramble for a cause and, as in the new movie based on\nJonathan Harr's 1995 book, ``A Civil Action'' (Random House), about\na leukemia cluster in Woburn, Mass., lawyers start suing. Yet over\nand over again, despite years _ sometimes decades _ of efforts to\nlink the disease with a cause, scientists usually come up empty\nhanded.\n\n   It can sound paradoxical. Here are unusual numbers of people\nwith a disease. Toxic chemicals are everywhere, and many of them\ncause cancers and other diseases in laboratory animals. Why should\nit be so hard to find a cause?\n\n   Some disease clusters have been successfully linked to toxins:\nCoal miners got black lung disease; asbestos workers got\nmesothelioma. Workers cleaning containers where polyvinyl chloride\nwas synthesized, breathing in fumes, got cancer of the blood\nvessels of the liver until machines replaced them.\n\n   But these examples of proven cause and effect are the rare\nexceptions, statisticians say. And they have two things in common:\nThe chemical exposure was enormous, and the disease was\nextraordinarily rare.\n\n   Most disease clusters are very different. Autism, breast cancer\nand leukemia are fairly common. And even when there does seem to be\nan unusually high incidence of a disease, the search for a chemical\nbasis usually turns up minute amounts of toxic substances that also\nare found in other places where there are no clusters. In other\nwords, linking the suspect chemicals to the disease can be very\nhard. It can also be difficult to know if a cluster is anything\nmore than a chance occurrence. And chance is hard to ignore.\n\n   Clusters will naturally appear even when events occur at random,\nsaid Dr. Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University.\n``There was a famous example of this when bombs were hitting London\nduring World War II,'' he said. ``People were sure they were\ntargeting individual places and they made up the most elaborate\nscenarios'' to explain how the bomb targets were selected. But in\nthe end, when the pattern was analyzed, the bombing turned out to\nbe random.\n\n   Another problem is how to draw the boundaries of a cluster.\n\n   Dr. James Robins, a statistician at Harvard University's School\nof Public Health, said it is a natural tendency to draw boundaries\naround groups of events to make clusters happen. If there are three\nchildren with cancer on a single block, you may draw your circle\naround the block _ making that a cluster _ rather than around the\ntown as a whole, which may show no cluster.\n\n   Say you do find a cluster. Unless you identify, say, black lung\nor mesothelioma, statisticians say, the next question is: How can\nyou decide if the cluster was caused by blind random clumpings of\ncases, with no environmental cause, or by a toxin in the\nenvironment?\n\n   Why would only one town have a disease cluster, some experts\nask, while other places with the same pollutants in the air or\nwater do not? One possibility might be an unidentified chemical in\na mix of pollutants that is unique to the town. But that, of\ncourse, raises questions of how to find it.\n\n   Finally, there is the indirect exposure problem. If there is no\ndirect link between chemicals and a disease, the tendency is to\nlook for other exposures. Could the fathers, for example, have had\ntheir sperm affected when they were growing up? Or could the\nmothers have been exposed to chemicals during pregnancy? Some\nstatisticians say that if people look hard enough and slice the\ndata enough ways and an association will emerge. What it means is\nanother question.\n\n   Others are optimistic. Suzanne Condon, the director of the\nbureau of environmental health assessment at the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Public Health, said that in an unpublished study her\ndepartment found that in the Woburn case, women who drank water\nfrom certain wells when they were pregnant were more likely to have\nchildren who developed leukemia. ``We believe this sheds a lot of\nlight on what happened in Woburn,'' she said. W.R. Grace, which was\naccused along with Beatrice Foods of dumping chemicals in a way\nthat allowed them to reach the water supply, paid $8 million into a\nsettlement fund. Both companies agreed to finance an expensive\ncleanup plan.\n\n   The Massachusetts' health department, however, warned on its Web\npage, ``Findings should be interpreted with caution due to the\nlimitations of conducting statistical analyses on small\npopulations.''\n\n   That may not be what people want to hear, statisticians concede.\n``People _ and I, too _ find it hard to accept that it is just\nrandom chance that brought this horrible consequence,'' said Dr.\nDavid Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at\nBerkeley.\n\n   Some statisticians ask whether it is worthwhile to keep pouring\nmoney and effort into searches for clusters and searches to explain\nthem.\n\n   ``The question is, at what point do you say we've see too many\nlike this?'' Robins asked. ``Huge amounts of money'' have gone to\nstudy disease clusters where the suspected cause was tiny amounts\nof chemicals, he added, and so far, ``nothing has come of it.''\n","Headline":"\nPROBING DISEASE CLUSTERS: EASIER TO SPOT THAN PROVE\n","Text":["\n   The trouble began when Bobbie Gallagher noticed that her\n2-year-old daughter was behaving strangely, obsessively spinning\nand scrupulously setting her toys in rows.
