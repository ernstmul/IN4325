Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York\nCity's 2.37 million Catholics and the Vatican's most forceful\nspokesman in the United States, died Wednesday night at his\nresidence around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral. He was\n80.\n\n   O'Connor died of cardiopulmonary arrest, said his spokesman,\nJoseph Zwilling. But he added that the cardinal's death was ``the\nresult of the tumor and the cancer that he was suffering from.''\nLast August, O'Connor had a tumor removed from the surface of his\nbrain.\n\n   The cardinal's failing health diminished his public appearances\nin recent months but did not diminish his stature as one of its\nmost powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov.\nGeorge W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican nomination for\npresident, expressed regret on Feb. 27 for not speaking out against\nracial and anti-Catholic intolerance during a campaign visit to Bob\nJones University in South Carolina, he did so in the form of a\nletter to O'Connor.\n\n   Word of the cardinal's grave condition spurred speculation over\nhis possible successor. This week, the name of Bishop Edward\nMichael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., flew to the top of a list of\ncandidates that has included William F. Murphy, an auxiliary bishop\nof Boston; Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the\nmilitary services; Henry J. Mansell, the bishop of Buffalo, N.Y.;\nand Justin F. Rigali, the archbishop of St. Louis.\n\n   The appointment of an archbishop, however, is a secret process\nthat rests in the hands of the Vatican, and appointments often come\nas a surprise to those in the church who thought they were in the\nknow. Indeed, when O'Connor was named archbishop in January, 1984,\nhis name had not even been mentioned in the speculation about who\nwould fill the post.\n\n   O'Connor was passionately outspoken in his opposition to\nabortion, the issue that shaped his tenure from the start. He was\nunconditional in upholding official Catholic teachings on topics\nlike homosexuality and the ordination of women. And he was\nunwavering in his loyalty to Pope John Paul, who had named him\narchbishop of New York as part of an effort to restore greater\ndoctrinal and organizational discipline in a church still feeling\nthe reverberations of reforms undertaken by the Second Vatican\nCouncil 20 years earlier.\n\n   All this gave the cardinal the profile of a zealous\nconservative, but he was also a passionate defender of organized\nlabor, an advocate for the poor and the homeless, a vocal assailant\nof racism and anti-Semitism, and an opponent of capital punishment.\nAnd although he had spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain and retired\nwith the rank of rear admiral, in the 1980s he condemned American\nsupport of counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central\nAmerica, questioned the need for spending on new weapons systems,\nand, to the end, remained a cautionary voice about American\nmilitary actions overseas.\n\n   O'Connor's outspokenness caused waves even before he arrived in\nNew York. He had upset many Jews in New York by declaring that\nwidespread abortion in the United States was ``precisely the same''\nas the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews.\n\n   At a televised news conference a few months later, he said, ``I\ndo not see how a Catholic in good conscience'' could vote for a\npolitical candidate favoring abortion, and, then, when asked\nwhether he might excommunicate Gov. Mario Cuomo for his support of\nabortion rights, the new archbishop refused to rule it out, setting\noff an intermittent feud with the governor.\n\n   In his first year as archbishop, Geraldine Ferraro, a Catholic\nwho supported abortion rights, was nominated by the Democrats to\nrun for vice president on a ticket headed by Walter Mondale. When\nshe was a congresswoman from Queens, Ferraro, along with several\nother Catholic public officials, had signed a letter saying that\nthere was ``a diversity of Catholic opinion'' about abortion.\n\n   After the letter was released during the presidential campaign,\nO'Connor assailed the candidate, saying, ``Geraldine Ferraro has\nmisrepresented Catholic teaching on abortion.'' He went on to say\nthat there was no diversity of Catholic opinion, only the opinion\nof the church that abortion was wrong under all circumstances.\n\n   This set off countercharges that O'Connor was signaling church\nsupport for the 1984 re-election of President Reagan, whom he had\npraised earlier as ``a friend of the unborn.''\n\n   Locally, the archbishop tangled with the city government over\naccess to contraceptive information and abortion in the church's\nchild care agencies. He also challenged Mayor Ed Koch's executive\norder barring discrimination against gays by any employer,\nincluding the church, that had contracts with the city. When a\ncourt struck down the mayor's executive order, the archbishop was\nequally opposed to a similar City Council bill on gay rights, which\npassed, even though it contained an exemption for religious\ninstitutions.\n\n   Conservative Catholics were delighted to have such a fresh\nchampion in town, but many others, inside and outside the church,\nwere similarly fascinated. For the cardinal's proclivity for\nconfrontation seemed part of a larger spontaneity and directness\nthat seemed right at home in New York City.\n\n   At his installation in St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 18,\n1984, the new archbishop put on a Mets cap, placed his own bishop's\nmiter on the head of a 10-year-old altar boy from the Bronx who was\nalso named John J. O'Connor, and mimicked Koch's regular query,\n``How'm I doing?''\n\n   He may have been the only major religious leader to hold a\nregular press conference every Sunday, after he had celebrated\n10:15 Mass at the cathedral. And in his early years, he was usually\nready with a curbside quip.\n\n   Reporters monitored his Sunday sermons and his weekly columns in\nthe archdiocesan newspaper, and pumped him at his news conferences,\nhoping for a tabloid headline for Monday.\n\n   Eventually, he expressed misgivings about the manner of his\ndebut in New York and his high visibility. ``Time after time I have\nto ask myself if the church would be better off _ certainly, I\nwould be better off _ if when I came here I had just become a\nsilent servant of the people,'' he said in 1993 in an interview\nwith The New York Times. He wondered whether he might have thrust\nhimself too much into politics, or whether a quieter style may not\nhave been better.\n\n   But then again, he mused, ``If you're false to your own\ntemperament, you're not going to be an effective leader.''\n\n   At times he did try to be more conciliatory. He dropped the\nHolocaust analogy in his preaching against abortion, and some\nJewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism.\n\n   And O'Connor also became close friends with Koch, and the two of\nthem collaborated on a book, ``His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (William\nMorrow & Co., 1989), regularly dined together and gave each other\nmoral support during their illnesses.\n\n   nn\n\n   John Joseph O'Connor was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 20, 1920,\nthe fourth of five children of Thomas and Dorothy O'Connor. His\nfather was a skilled interior painter, a specialist in applying\ngold leaf to the ornamental ceilings of auditoriums and churches.\nHis mother suffered blindness for a year and attributed her\nrecovery of sight in one eye to the intervention of St. Rita of\nCascia.\n\n   In many interviews and columns he wrote for Catholic New York,\nthe archdiocesan weekly newspaper, O'Connor often recalled his\nearly upbringing: the warmth and seriousness of family prayers and\nreligious observances; the forceful views of his father, ``a union\nman,'' on the rights of labor; the need for frugality during the\nhard Depression years. His working-class roots, he said, left him\nalways a bit uncomfortable in the formal surroundings of the\narchbishop's residence.\n\n   He attended both public and Catholic grade schools in\nPhiladelphia before entering West Catholic High School for Boys,\nwhich was run by the order of Christian Brothers, who encouraged\nhim to pursue a calling to the priesthood. He was ordained a priest\non Dec. 15, 1945, a month before his 26th birthday.\n\n   For seven years, he was an assistant pastor in a Philadelphia\nparish. He taught in Catholic high schools as well as a night\nschool for adults, conducted two weekly radio programs on local\nstations, worked in hospital psychiatric wards and developed\nspecial programs to instruct retarded children. His work with\nretarded children remained a lifelong passion. As a young priest,\nhe thought it might be his chief occupation until he answered a\nplea for chaplains to serve in the armed forces during the Korean\nWar.\n\n   A two-year stint turned into a 27-year career, during which he\ntraveled the world celebrating Mass in foxholes and on aircraft\ncarriers. He served under fire with the Marines in Vietnam, became\nsenior chaplain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and, in 1975,\nwas appointed chief of Navy chaplains with the rank of rear\nadmiral. During his military career, he also found time to earn a\nmaster's degree in clinical psychology at the Catholic University\nof America and a doctorate in political science at Georgetown\nUniversity.\n\n   ``He is surely one of the two or three smartest graduate\nstudents I ever had,'' said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former\nambassador to the United Nations, who taught him at Georgetown.\n\n   Expecting to retire to parish life in 1979, he instead was made\nan auxiliary bishop assigned to the military vicariate, the church\nunit serving the armed forces. The vicariate was administered by\nthe archbishop of New York until 1985, when it became independent.\nBishop O'Connor was still supervising chaplains, although now from\na post in the Catholic hierarchy rather than from one in the Navy.\n\n   Military matters were fated to play a central role in O'Connor's\nlife. In 1968 he published ``A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam'' (World\nPublishing Co.), a book that argued that the American intervention\nthere was morally and legally justified. ``I am convinced that the\nadministration has opted to accept the tragedy of war as the only\navailable road to meaningful peace,'' he wrote.\n\n   ``That's a bad book, you know,'' he later told Nat Hentoff, who\nwas interviewing him for a profile in The New Yorker that was later\nexpanded into the 1988 biography ``John Cardinal O'Connor''\n(Scribners). ``It was a very limited view of what was going on. I\nregret having published it.''\n\n   In 1983, church watchers wondered whether O'Connor's appointment\nto bishop in Scranton, Pa., a relatively minor diocese, was a form\nof ecclesiastical exile or the first step to bigger things. The\nquestion was answered with surprising rapidity. On Jan. 31, 1984,\nafter only eight months in Scranton, he was named the eighth\narchbishop of New York.\n\n   O'Connor, who had energetically thrown himself into the Scranton\njob, was taken aback by his selection.\n\n   ``When I went to Scranton, I hoped I would die there,'' he said\nsoon afterward, pausing for effect and then adding, ``I came to New\nYork knowing I would die here.''\n","Headline":"\nCARDINAL O'CONNOR, FORCEFUL VOICE OF THE VATICAN, DEAD AT 80 \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York\nCity's 2.37 million Catholics and the Vatican's most forceful\nspokesman in the United States, died Wednesday night at his\nresidence around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral.
