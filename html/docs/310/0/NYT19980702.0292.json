And for good reason.\nMother Nature had no hand in crafting this one.\n\n   Instead, it's the work of wireless phone company US West and a\nTucson, Ariz., company that has made a variety of faux features,\nincluding the artificial rocks for a posh Phoenician resort in\nPhoenix and the FAO Schwarz Trojan horse at Caesar's Palace in Las\nVegas.\n\n   Unlike those cosmetic features, Larson's latest man-made project\nis a actually a sheath over a monopole, commonly known as a\ncellular phone tower.\n\n   ``We asked ourselves, `How do you create an icon or something\nthat allows Air Touch or US West to build out their system?'

The Larson Co. has hidden monopoles in\npine trees, palm trees, church steeples, even in artificial bricks\non the side of buildings, such as America West Arena and a\nScottsdale coffee house.\n\n   But this is the first saguaro that doubles as a cellular tower\nas far as anyone can tell.\n\n   ``It's the first one we've done,'' said Rex Engebretson,\nregional real estate manager for US West.\n\n   ``There was concern that we do something of a stealth nature\nbecause the site is unique in terms of elevation,'' he added.\n\n   The faux saguaro sits on state land overlooking the freeway. US\nWest needed about 65 feet to get a two-mile radius coverage area.\nThe elevation of the site meant the cactus could be about 30 feet\nand still cover the required area.\n\n   The need to hide towers is driven by growth in their numbers.\n\n   More than 55,600 antenna sites dot the country, about half\nwhat's needed to build out each carrier's system, according to the\nCellular Telephone Industry Association in Washington, D.C. The\ntrade group does not break down the sites by state or county.\n\n   CTIA spokesman Tim Ayers said he had not heard of any stealth\nsaguaros anywhere else in the country.\n\n   ``That's cool,'' he said. ``I've heard of pine trees and palm\ntrees, though.''\n\n   Everyone, it seems, wants the convenience of using a cellular\nphone. Few like the ugly towers required to make that technically\npossible.\n\n   The Larson Co. came up with the concept of a faux saguaro about\ntwo years ago, Vice President Scott Krezner said. It began working\non prototypes soon afterward. Construction took about two months.\n\n   The stealth saguaro is about 30 feet tall and 20 inches in\ndiameter. It's made of fiberglass, which is transparent to radio\nwaves. It cost $30,000 to $40,000 to build, Krezner said.\n\n   That's considerably more than an unobstructed monopole.\n\n   But US West's Engebretson said the cost was necessary to\ncomplete the buildout of the company's network in the Phoenix area.\nUS West has about 180 sites in the area.\n\n   Despite the stealthlike nature, the faux saguaro is surrounded\nby two big metal boxes.
