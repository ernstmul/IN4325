Times News Service    \n\n   If wireless networks proliferate as fast as many researchers\npredict, is it possible for the airwaves to become overloaded? Cell\nphones and some handheld organizers transmit and receive scores of\nmessages a day. With laptop computers and other devices added to\nthe mix, will there eventually be one big wireless traffic jam?\n\n   ``These are questions that the industry takes very seriously,''\nsaid Jeff Abramowitz, president of the Wireless LAN Association, a\nnonprofit group established by companies that build technology for\nwireless local area networks, or LANs. In the next few years,\nanalysts say, these wireless LANs will become an integral part of\noffice and home networks, enabling people to gain high-speed\nInternet access from laptop computers without having to plug into a\nphone line or cable connection.\n\n   But wireless LAN companies are not the only ones worried about\ninterference. Engineers in a range of wireless industries are\nconducting mathematical studies and field tests to determine\nwhether interference will be a real problem.\n\n   Much of the focus is on the 2.4-gigahertz band of the radio\nspectrum. The band, which stretches from 2.4 to 2.483 gigahertz,\nhas become more and more crowded in the past few years, used by a\nvariety of devices that do not require licenses from the Federal\nCommunications Commission.\n\n   Technologies occupying the space include wireless LANs, some of\nthe latest cordless phones and handheld devices that use Bluetooth,\na standard being developed to enable gadgets to communicate without\nwires.\n\n   Another system operating in the 2.4-gigahertz range is Ricochet,\na wireless network for urban areas. Ricochet is currently available\nin Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The company is\ninstalling more iterations of the network, which will offer faster\naccess.\n\n   Most people using Ricochet are spared the problem of\ninterference by the system's design. The only pieces of the system\nthat use the 2.4-gigahertz spectrum are the network's access\npoints. Attached to utility poles, outdoors and hanging at least 30\nfeet above the ground, the access points are out of the way of most\nother wireless traffic.\n\n   The signals sent between a laptop and an access point in the\nRicochet network use the 900-megahertz band _ a lower section of\nthe radio spectrum.\n\n   ``We won't bump into each other that much,'' said Tim Yankey,\ndirector of product marketing for Metricom, which makes Ricochet.\n\n   Microwave ovens also use waves in the 2.4-gigahertz range,\nthough ovens are the least of researchers' problems. Microwave\novens are designed to prevent the emission of electromagnetic waves\noutside their boxes.\n\n   Cordless phones that operate in the 2.4-gigahertz band are more\nof a potential problem. Most of the phones are designed, however,\nso that they can be set at one of several narrow frequency bands to\navoid interference with neighbors' phones. Others are configured so\nthat the signals hop from one frequency to another to prevent\ninterference. Those design elements, some engineers say, enable\ntheir signals to be kept separate from other wireless devices.\n\n   But it is Bluetooth technology that may interfere most with\nwireless LANs, and vice versa. Imagine, for example, a day when an\nemployee is using a Bluetooth cell phone and a laptop that is\nconnected to the Internet via a wireless LAN. At the moment that\nthe employee tries to download phone numbers from phone to laptop,\nthe Internet connection could slow down or the phone transmission\nstall.\n\n   What could be happening is that packets of information are\ncolliding with other packets, similar to traffic problems on a\nwired network. In such a case, the devices would continue to resend\nthe data packets until they make it through.\n\n   ``The end user will see it as a delay of service,'' said Steve\nParker, product line manager for new mobile platforms at 3Com,\nwhich is developing Bluetooth devices. ``But it is not as\nproblematic as you may think.'' Such a collision is ``statistically\nvery unlikely to occur,'' Parker said, because both existing\nwireless LANs and forthcoming Bluetooth technologies are designed\nto spread their signals across the 2.4-gigahertz spectrum before\njoining again at the receiving end.\n\n   In addition, Bluetooth runs at a range of a few yards, whereas\nwireless LAN's cover hundreds of feet. That means, Parker said,\nthat Bluetooth devices will rarely affect LAN transmissions in\nnearby offices.\n\n   Soon enough, said Skip Bryan, director of technology market\ndevelopment for Ericsson, new hardware and software will be\ndeveloped that enable these wireless devices to peacefully\nco-exist. Devices could be designed to detect each other's\npresence, for example, enabling software to switch between the\nnetworks.\n\n   ``We know about the problem well enough in advance,'' Bryan\nsaid, ``that there will be minimal impact.''\n\n   ``We need to be alert,'' said Richard Favara, president of\nExpedition Networks, a company that sets up networking systems for\ncorporate and educational clients. ``But do we need to be worried?\nNo.''\n\n   In fact, some Bluetooth proponents can see a day when the two\nnetworks will not only co-exist, but also communicate.\n\n   In the meantime, a bigger concern than interference may be low\nbandwidth, which limits the rate at which data can be sent.\nCurrently, wireless network speeds are not as fast as wired ones,\nbut the more people use multimedia on their wired computers, the\nmore they may try to send and receive the same large files on their\nwireless ones. And like most networks, wireless LANs and Bluetooth\nnetworks become incrementally slower as more people use them.\n\n   Imagine, for example, a day when airports are equipped with\nwireless networks and hundreds of people in the waiting areas are\ntyping away on laptops, checking e-mail and surfing the Web.\n\n   If planes are on time and people are moving through the airport\nat a normal pace, Abramowitz said, the networks will probably be\nable to handle the load. But if the airport terminal begins to\nbecome crowded, because of delayed or canceled flights, he said,\n``then you have a problem.''\n\n   Engineers are already developing wireless systems with broader\nbandwidth. And some are even considering moving out of the heavily\npopulated territory of 2.4 gigahertz. A standard called HiperLAN,\nwhich is being developed in Europe, uses the 5.3-gigahertz band.\n\n   ``But we think there will be a longtime use'' of the 2.4\nspectrum, Bryan said, ``even if we populate the world with millions\nof Bluetooth devices.''\n","Headline":"\nPREPARING FOR THE COLLISION OF WIRELESS SERVICES \n","Text":["\n   If wireless networks proliferate as fast as many researchers\npredict, is it possible for the airwaves to become overloaded?
