But the\nexperience was a powerful lesson, and she no longer uses the cell\nphone while driving.\n\n   ``Not a smart thing for me to do,'' said Bremer, a Kansas City\nresident and cellular user for more than five years. ``I could have\nhurt someone.''\n\n   Joining a growing national trend, a Missouri legislator has\nintroduced a bill aimed at cutting down on the potential for\naccidents caused by drivers using cell phones.\n\n   Rep. Marsha Campbell, a Kansas City Democrat, said her bill\nwould prohibit the use of cellular telephones while driving, except\nin emergencies. Violation of the law, a misdemeanor, would be\npunishable by either a $500 fine or six months in jail, or both. If\na cellular user caused an accident, the consequences would be a\n$1,000 fine or one year in jail, or both.\n\n   ``To have a cell phone in the car is a great safety measure,''\nCampbell said. ``I have a cell phone, and I like it. But I'm not\nsure if anyone's phone call is worth another's life.''\n\n   Campbell said she always pulled over to use her phone and\nsuggested that others do the same.\n\n   She decided to introduce a bill after some constituents\ncontacted her about restricting cell phone use. During her morning\nwalks and commutes to the capital, she, too, had noticed\nabsent-minded drivers using cell phones.\n\n   Campbell's cell phone bill makes Missouri one of 11 states\nconsidering such legislation. The National Conference of State\nLegislatures says that last year, 22 states considered legislation\nregarding cell phones and driving. The proposals vary, from\ncomplete bans to mandating proper use of cell phones.\n\n   In eight states, cell phone legislation has failed, but laws\nwere passed in California, Florida and Massachusetts. None of the\nthree states has a complete ban; in Massachusetts, for example,\ndrivers who do not keep at least one hand on the wheel while using\na cell phone may face fines of $35 to $150, depending on whether\nthey have previous violations.\n\n   No similar bill has been proposed in Kansas.\n\n   ``It's definitely an issue that's gaining momentum among state\nlegislators,'' said Matt Sundeen, transportation policy specialist\nfor Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures. Sundeen\nhas been tracking such legislation for two years.\n\n   ``The sheer volume of cell phone use is causing representatives\nto be more concerned,'' he said.\n\n   That volume is considerable: The federal Department of\nTransportation estimates that 80 million cellular phones will be in\nuse this year nationwide. In the Kansas City area, 43.7 percent of\nresidents had cell phones in 1999, according to research by the\nMinnesota Opinion Research Institute for The Kansas City Star.\n\n   Nationally, 85 percent of cell phone users talk in the car,\naccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In\n1998, the agency studied the correlation between cell phone use and\ntraffic accidents. Researchers found that cell phones were major\ncontributors to the most common cause of accidents: inattention.\nWhile cell phone users were busy dialing, conversing, answering the\nphone or hanging up, their attention simply was not on the road.\n\n   In Missouri, driver inattention contributed to 754 accident\ndeaths, 47,064 injuries and 78,722 instances of property damage in\n1998, said Sgt. John Hotz of the Missouri Highway Patrol. Hotz said\ncellular phone use was one of many causes of driver inattention.\n\n   But that's not the only problem researchers have found related\nto driving and using a cellular phone. In Finland, where cellular\nphones are more popular than in the United States, another study\nconcluded last year that talking on a cell phone resulted in an\naverage half-second delay in brake reaction whether a hands-free\nphone or a hand-held phone was used.\n\n   A 1991 study funded by the American Automobile Association found\nthat 151 subjects in simulated driving situations failed to respond\nor had slower response times to traffic situations with hand-held\nor hands-free cellular phones.\n\n   The study participants failed to respond 30 percent of the time\nwhile using cell phones.\n\n   The more intense the phone conversation, the slower the response\ntime became. Even those who used a cell phone often had delayed\nresponse times.\n\n   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report\ndetailed a number of cell phone-related accidents. In a majority of\nthe cases, the cell phone users struck cars or other large objects\nin clear view.\n\n   Such accidents can be serious, even fatal. Two Missouri fatal\ncar wrecks were traced to cellular phone use in 1995, the report\nsaid.\n\n   In January 1998, a truck driver talking on a cellular phone in\nPortland, Ore., drove his truck into the path of an oncoming\nfreight train, according to The Oregonian newspaper. He was killed\ninstantly.\n\n   Just two months ago, a 2-year-old girl in Hilltown, Pa., was\nkilled when the car in which she was riding was struck by a driver\nwho ran a stop sign while using a cell phone, according to the\nTri-State Media News Network.\n(MORE)\n","Headline":"\nKC STATE REPRESENTATIVE INTRODUCES CELL PHONE RESTRICTION BILL \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _Kathy Bremer quit using her cellular phone in\nthe car after she caught herself zipping through a red light, right\npast a police officer.\n","\n   She didn't hit anyone, and she didn't get a ticket.
