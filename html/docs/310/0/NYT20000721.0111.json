Cigarettes do exactly what they're\nsupposed to do: give people a good smoke, a bit of relaxation, a\ncool image in some circles and a hell of an addiction.\n\n   We all know that's what they're designed to do, and they do it\nvery well.\n\n   You might as well call lawyers defective because they earn\nmillions of dollars convincing jurors that the big bad tobacco\ncompanies made smokers ignore all those surgeon general's warnings\nand poison themselves.\n\n   Well, bad example. Lawyers are a defective product. The Florida\ntobacco verdict will be under appeal longer than any kid now taking\nup cigarettes will live.\n\n   Sure, the tobacco companies have a history of lying,\nmanipulation and fooling young people into doing things that are\nbad for their health. But so has the U.S. government, whenever it\nhas decided to commit troops to dubious interventions.\n\n   You can't even get the government to pay money to those who\nfought good fights they didn't choose, like veterans of Bataan. But\nthe government and trial lawyers are happy to give millions to\nthose who voluntarily took up a habit they knew wasn't good for\nthem.\n\n   Risk and reward are a little out of whack, especially since\nlawyers get an inordinate amount of the action from class-action\nsuits.\n\n   Liberalism is dead in legislatures, but lives in perverse form\nin the law.
