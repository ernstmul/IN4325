FISHER   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   One of the apparent paradoxes of the digital revolution is that\nit has proved a boon to the makers of analog chips, those quaint\ndevices that process continuous electronic signals rather than the\nzeros and ones that their digital cousins do.\n\n   It is only an (italics)apparent(end italics) paradox: Humans\ncannot hear, see, taste, smell or touch digital, and no matter how\ndigital a device, it cannot be powered digitally or receive radio\nwaves in digital form. So wherever a device interacts with its user\nor its environment, there one finds analog chips.\n\n   ``No matter what, the real world is going to be analog,'' said\nJill Hauser, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, the money manager. ``If\nanything, the digital phenomenon has increased demand, it has\ndriven analog.''\n\n   Drew Peck, an analyst at S.G. Cowen, added, ``Human beings are\nanalog.''\n\n   Several diversified chip makers, including Texas Instruments, ST\nMicroelectronics and the National Semiconductor Corp., include\nanalog chips in their product portfolios. But analysts say some of\nthe best prospects are in four companies that specialize in analog\nchips, and particularly in the high end of the analog market.\n\n   Two of these are pure-play analog companies: Linear Technology\nand Maxim Integrated Products. Two others, Analog Devices and\nBurr-Brown, make primarily analog components but also derive a\nsubstantial amount of sales from so-called mixed-signal chips,\nwhich combine digital and analog functions, as well as digital\nsignal processors, or DSPs, specialized chips often used in\nconjunction with analog circuits.\n\n   None of these stocks are cheap at the moment, and none are\ntrading too far from their highs. Linear Technology closed on\nFriday at $63.6875, up 42.2 percent so far this year. Maxim is at\n$67.3125, up 54.1 percent; Analog Devices at $56.3125, up 79.5\npercent, and Burr-Brown at $39.4375, up 68.3 percent.\n\n   In general, producing analog chips is less capital intensive\nthan making digital chips, because analog chips do not benefit from\nthe latest manufacturing processes.\n\n   This is because packing circuits closer together, which digital\nchips do to increase speed, only causes noise and heat problems for\nanalog. Lower capital outlays mean less depreciation dragging on\nearnings.\n\n   At the same time, analog chip design is still as much art as\nscience, benefiting little from modern computer-aided design\nsoftware. So analog companies are dependent on design power of the\nhuman kind: engineers with years of experience.\n\n   Because these experts are hard to come by, the barriers to entry\nin the analog business are surprisingly high. And because\nindividuals, unlike computer programs, tend to design highly\ndifferentiated chips, competition for any given product is low.\n\n   So analog is ``intellectually intensive, not capital\nintensive,'' said Louis Gerhardy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley\nDean Witter.\n\n   Several market trends point to continued growth of analog chip\nuse _ and stock price appreciation. There is, for example, the\ngrowing use of analog-rich flat-panel displays on desktops, and the\nmigration of users from desktops to portables.\n\n   ``The analog chip content in a notebook computer is two to three\ntimes what it is in a desktop,'' Gerhardy said.\n\n   The popularity of digital cellular phones and the growing use of\nfiber optic data and communications lines are playing a role, too.\nFiber optic lines typically have analog transceivers and amplifiers\nat both ends, and ``even though we talk about digital cellular\nphones versus the analog phones of a year or two ago, the analog\ncontent in the phones is actually higher,'' he said.\n\n   Radio waves depend on continuous, slight fluctuations of a\nfrequency, which is why the radio portion of a cellular telephone,\nTV satellite receiver or any sort of wireless communications device\nis full of analog chips. ``Ones and zeros don't travel; electrons\ntravel,'' said Terry Ragsdale, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.\n\n   Gerhardy has strong buys on Maxim and Linear Technology, each\nwith a target price of $80, and a rating of market outperform on\nboth Analog Devices, with a target of $65, and Burr-Brown, with a\ntarget of $50.\n\n   Where Gerhardy prefers the pure plays, Peck, of S.G. Cowen,\nrecommends Analog Devices and Texas Instruments, for their ability\nto produce chips that mix analog and digital signals, as well as\ndigital signal processors.\n\n   While he expects total semiconductor sales to grow at 13 percent\nto 14 percent a year for the next five years, and analog to grow at\n20 percent, he expects mixed signal to grow at 30 percent 35\npercent a year.\n\n   Peck rates Analog Devices a strong buy, with a target of $75,\nand Texas Instruments a buy, based on its current price of $83.875,\nwith a long-term target of $140.\n\n   Ragsdale recommends Analog Devices, with a target of $68.
