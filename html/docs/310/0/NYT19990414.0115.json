As we know,\nhowever, the police almost never pull someone over for erratic\ndriving caused by eating a Big Mac with one hand and finishing up a\ntax return with the other.\n\n   The sad truth is, an all-out crackdown on disengaged drivers\nwould leave law enforcement officials little time to pursue serious\nlawbreakers.\n\n   But that isn't stopping state and local lawmakers around the\ncountry from stepping up to the plate to take on the growing peril\nof car phones.\n\n   Even in Texas, where not so long ago a person could drive and\nguzzle a six-pack of beer without fear of arrest, the Legislature\nis pondering a bill that would outlaw the practice of driving and\ntalking on the phone.\n\n   The Star-Telegram quoted the bill's sponsor, Democratic Rep.\nPaul Moreno of El Paso: ``I think that if we make it specific that\nperhaps we can save a life.
