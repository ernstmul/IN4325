Times News Service   \n\n   After having a biopsy taken of a suspicious lump, a patient\nusually puts his fate in the hands of a person he has never met: a\npathologist.\n\n   Off in a lab somewhere, the pathologist decides whether a sliver\nof tissue is benign or malignant, and if cancerous, how aggressive\nthe disease is, decisions that are pivotal to the treatment. But\nmost people don't know anything about the pathologist, don't ask\nfor his credentials or those of the laboratory, or ask for a second\nopinion.\n\n   For most patients, this hands-off approach works well. But\naccording to a study that reviewed the biopsy slides of 6,171\npatients referred to Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions for cancer\ntreatments, 86 patients had diagnoses that were significantly wrong\nand would have led to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.\n\n   The rate of error was 1.4 percent, which is low, but not\ninsignificant. At Johns Hopkins alone, it would be equal to about\none cancer patient a week with a wrong diagnosis, and across the\ncountry could add up to a conservative estimate of 30,000 mistakes\na year.\n\n   For 20 patients, a second opinion changed a malignant diagnosis\nto a benign one. In five other cases, a growth reported to be\nbenign was later found to be malignant, and in six cases one type\nof cancer had been mistaken for a different type. These results,\npublished in December in the journal Cancer, are consistent with\nprevious studies.\n\n   Some types of cancer, though, like ovarian, cervical, skin or\nlymphatic, are more difficult to diagnose and are somewhat more\nprone to errors. In an earlier study at Johns Hopkins, a review of\nthe slides of cancer patients referred for prostate surgery found\nmajor errors in 6 of 535 men, sparing them from surgery.\n\n   In a 1998 study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical\nCenter in Dallas, a review of ovarian, uterine, cervical and vulvar\nbiopsies found major errors in 2 percent of the cases, leading\ndoctors to cancel six operations and five chemotherapy treatments.\nAnd a 1997 review of patients who went to the University of Texas\nM.D. Anderson Cancer Center for second opinions of their brain and\nspinal cord biopsies found major errors in 8.8 percent of cases.\n\n   The researchers did not include more minor errors in rating how\nfast-growing and how advanced a cancer was. These so-called grading\nand staging errors are more common and can affect how aggressively\na patient is treated.\n\n   ``We don't want to send a panic among everybody that their\nbiopsies are wrong,'' said Dr. Jonathan I. Epstein, the study's\nlead author and professor of pathology, urology and oncology at\nJohns Hopkins. In fact, the majority of people who have been told\nthey have cancer do indeed have it and are getting the correct\ntreatment, he said. ``But,'' he added, ``there's a sizable\nminority, maybe 2 to 3 percent, who have a wrong diagnosis or who\ncould have a more accurate diagnosis.''\n\n   Typically once a biopsy is taken, the specimen is sent to a\ncommercial laboratory or a hospital's in-house laboratory. Though\nthere is a general perception that pathology is an exact science _\nthat a cell is either malignant or not _ the differences between\nmalignant and benign can be subtle, and interpretations can be\nsubjective. In some cases, spotting a malignancy is easy, but in\nothers, the clues that tell a pathologist a cell is cancerous are\nwell concealed.\n\n   Experts attribute the majority of the errors to the many benign\nmimickers of cancer and the reverse: malignancies that mimic benign\nprocesses. One patient at Johns Hopkins received a diagnosis of\nskin cancer of the ear and was told that a section of the middle\near had to be removed. The pathologist who reviewed the slide found\nthat it was a simple fungus infection.\n\n   ``Pathologists who have a lot of experience can recognize the\nmimickers, whereas a pathologist who's not as experienced may\nconfuse the two and make a misdiagnosis of cancer,'' Epstein said.\n\n   The pathologist's job is only getting more difficult as doctors\nmove toward less invasive procedures that are designed to disturb\nthe body as little as possible. Using needles to remove samples\nfrom the prostate and breast, for instance, surgeons are eking out\nthe smallest possible amount of tissue, often no thicker than the\nnib of a pen, giving pathologists much less to examine.\n\n   ``We rely on seeing how the abnormal cells differ in their\ngrowth and appearance from normal cells,'' said Dr. John E.\nTomaszewski, director of surgical pathology at the University of\nPennsylvania Medical Center. ``That may get lost if you have a very\nsmall piece of tissue. What was an easy diagnosis of a large piece\nof tissue becomes a very difficult diagnosis on a small piece of\ntissue.''\n\n   Moreover, as the options for treating cancer have multiplied, it\nhas become important not only to make the diagnosis of cancer, but\nto subclassify tissue and grade it as more or less aggressive and\nadvanced.\n\n   ``These are very delicate classifications, and to some extent\nsubjective and dependent on the experience of the pathologist,''\nsaid Dr. Juan Rosai, who recently was chief of pathology at\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center but became chief of\npathology at Italy's National Cancer Institute. The difference in\ngrade could influence whether someone gets surgery, chemotherapy,\nradiation or no treatment.\n\n   As the field of pathology grows more challenging, hospitals are\nadopting new strategies and some health experts are advocating more\nstringent rules for diagnoses.\n\n   Epstein and his co-authors, for example, are advocating that\nwhen a diagnosis has been made at another institution, hospitals\nrequire an in-house pathologist to examine a patient's slides\nbefore beginning treatment. ``Hospitals shouldn't trust somebody\nelse's diagnosis to treat a patient,'' Epstein said.\n\n   Many comprehensive cancer centers and academic medical centers\nalready have this type of policy in place, though it is not always\nfollowed by some doctors. Among smaller hospitals, only some have\nsuch policies.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Some experts believe hospitals should even go a step further by\ninsisting that every biopsy, not just referrals, be seen by at\nleast two sets of eyes.\n\n   Large academic centers typically have a daily conference to\ndiscuss difficult cases, and specimens can be viewed by a few\nexperts through a multiheaded microscope. These centers also have\nmany subspecialty pathologists, experts in gynecological cancer,\nfor instance, who tend to consult with each other informally.\n\n   Some small institutions require two pathologists to be involved\nin every cancer diagnosis, whereas others recommend that the\npractice be used only with cancers that are more difficult to\ndiagnose. Some hospitals randomly send 10 percent of slides to\noutside labs for quality control, Epstein said.\n\n   Even where there are no formal procedures requiring them to do\nso, it is common for pathologists to show ambiguous slides to\ncolleagues or to send them out to a nationally recognized expert\nfor review.\n\n   Some experts question whether there is reason to require\nwidespread use of second opinions. ``On an individual basis,\ngetting a second opinion is obviously a good thing to do, but on a\nhealth-care-wide basis, where you're asking the question of cost\neffectiveness, this is a difficult question,'' Tomaszewski said.\n\n   One solution may be to set guidelines specifying which types of\ncancers and cases are more difficult and should be routinely\nreviewed. Cancers with a higher likelihood of misdiagnosis include\nthose that are gynecological and lymphatic, as well as leukemia,\nsarcomas and those of the prostate, skin, liver and kidney.\n\n   Patients can take it upon themselves to request second opinions\non their biopsies. And some pathologists have seen an increase in\nrequests for second opinions made directly from patients.\n\n   ``It's such a devastating diagnosis with so much implication for\ntreatment that I think it's perfectly reasonable to have a second\nopinion,'' says Dr. William Hoskins, deputy physician and chief for\ndisease management at Sloan-Kettering.\n\n   Epstein added: ``If I were a patient and was diagnosed with a\nmalignancy, I would get a second opinion before undergoing any\nmajor surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. And if I had a negative\nbiopsy on an organ that's known to have a higher rate of error I'd\nalso get a second opinion.''\n","Headline":"\nVALUE OF SECOND OPINIONS IS UNDERSCORED IN STUDY OF BIOPSIES \n","Text":["\n   After having a biopsy taken of a suspicious lump, a patient\nusually puts his fate in the hands of a person he has never met: a\npathologist.\n","\n   Off in a lab somewhere, the pathologist decides whether a sliver\nof tissue is benign or malignant, and if cancerous, how aggressive\nthe disease is, decisions that are pivotal to the treatment.
