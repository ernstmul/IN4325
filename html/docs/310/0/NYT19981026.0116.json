A radar transmits pulses of radio waves\ninto the ground, and a computer analyzes their reflections.

This means that ground radars need a large power supply\nto generate pulses intense enough to penetrate the ground.

Once the mines are located, they can be\ndestroyed at once or their exact position noted so they can be\ndealt with later. Of course, a mine would explode if the bullet\nhits it.\n\n   The radar pulse is generated from the bullet's kinetic energy by\na process known as magnetic flux compression. Inside the bullet is\na solid metal cylinder, surrounded by a tightly wound coil of wire.\nAs the bullet leaves the gun, a battery passes a current through\nthe coil, generating a magnetic field in the cylinder.\n\n   When the bullet smashes into the ground, the sudden deceleration\nforces the cylinder out from inside the coil. In much the same way\nthat moving a wire through a magnetic field generates an electrical\ncurrent in the wire, the sudden movement of the metal cylinder\nthrough the magnetic field induces a large pulse of current in the\ncoil. The coil then acts like an antenna, converting the pulse into\na short burst of high frequency radiation.\n\n   The lightweight system can be fitted to any helicopter.
