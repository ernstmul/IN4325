Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Using secret evidence to send someone to jail may\nbe unconstitutional, except in immigration courts, where foreigners\nor immigrants have been imprisoned for years on the basis of\nclassified hearsay, federal judges have found.\n\n   Now Congress is considering a bill that could alter or abolish\nthe practice. The bill would restrict the use of evidence kept\nsecret from a defendant and his lawyers. Nearly 100 sponsors in the\nHouse have backed the measure, the subject of a hearing scheduled\nbefore the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.\n\n   Secret evidence has been used to jail about 100 foreigners and\nresident aliens in the last decade, the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service says. The detainees are held on the basis of\nevidence introduced by the government, evidence the accused cannot\nsee or challenge at immigration hearings. Court records show that\nsuch evidence has included rumor and innuendo such as the\nunsubstantiated accusations of an ex-wife or a former lover, or\nhearsay from foreign intelligence services.\n\n   One case involved Hany Kiareldeen, a Palestinian man married to\nan American woman. He was freed from a New Jersey jail last year,\nafter a federal district judge ruled that ``the government's use of\nsecret evidence violates the due process'' that the Constitution\nguarantees, even to resident aliens.\n\n   The secret evidence accusing Kiareldeen of links to terrorists,\nlargely compiled and classified by the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, was partly revealed on appeal and proved untrue. A\nprimary source of the accusations was Kiareldeen's ex-wife, who was\nfighting him in a child custody battle, court records show.\n\n   Congressional testimony suggests that a case based on secret\nevidence occurs about once a month. The numbers are hard to\nconfirm, in part because of poor record-keeping by the immigration\ncourts, which often make no formal record of hearings, and in part\nbecause of the secrecy surrounding the cases.\n\n   The INS says 11 people are now being detained in the United\nStates because of secret evidence. Opponents of the process say the\nnumber is higher.\n\n   One of those detained is Mazen al-Naijar, a professor at the\nUniversity of South Florida. A Palestinian, he has been in jail for\nthree years. Neither he nor his lawyers have ever seen the evidence\nagainst him, which has been used to accuse him of associating with\nterrorists.\n\n   Another is Ali Yasin Mohammed Karim, an Iraqi Kurd who worked\nwith the Central Intelligence Agency against Saddam Hussein. He was\nevacuated to California after one of the CIA's covert operations\ncollapsed in 1996 _ and then was arrested. He has been jailed for\nnearly four years because of secret evidence against him, provided\nby the CIA and the FBI.\n\n   That evidence was ``hearsay'' and ``nonsense,'' said R. James\nWoolsey Jr., a former director of central intelligence, who\nvolunteered to defend Karim and had the security clearances needed\nto see the evidence.\n\n   Now that the evidence has been declassified, largely through\nWoolsey's work, the judge has indicated she may release Karim this\nweek.\n\n   David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor who will\ntestify on Tuesday in favor of the bill, said ``secret evidence is\nsomething we associate with totalitarian regimes, not with free\ndemocratic nations.''\n\n   ``The best test for truth is an adversarial process in which\nboth sides get tested by cross-examination,'' he said. ``Secret\nevidence makes that impossible. We've seen innocent people locked\nup for years on evidence which, once revealed, would not justify\ntheir being locked up for a day.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   For the last two years, the INS has been considering revising\nits rules on the use of secret evidence, at the request of Attorney\nGeneral Janet Reno. But an immigration service official said the\nagency opposed the proposed limits on secret evidence.\n\n   ``It will make us choose either between requesting an agency to\ndeclassify national security information, or going ahead and\nletting a benefit be granted to an alien who is a danger to\nnational security,'' the immigration official said.\n\n   David A. Martin, a former general counsel for the immigration\nservice, said that secret evidence should be used sparingly.\n\n   ``There is an argument for maintaining the use of secret\nevidence in some cases,'' Martin said, citing, for example, a case\nof a suspected terrorist entering the country illegally. But, he\nadded, ``whenever it's used, it makes for bad procedure.''\n\n   ``You lose a lot of protections you count on'' under the\nConstitution, he said. ``If you don't know the evidence you're\nconfronting, you're not in a good position to defend against it.''\n","Headline":"\nHOUSE CONSIDERS BANNING INS USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Using secret evidence to send someone to jail may\nbe unconstitutional, except in immigration courts, where foreigners\nor immigrants have been imprisoned for years on the basis of\nclassified hearsay, federal judges have found.\n","\n   Now Congress is considering a bill that could alter or abolish\nthe practice.
