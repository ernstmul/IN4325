(af) \n By ABBY ELLIN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Three years ago, in chatting with a guest at the Holiday Inn she\nmanages in Binghamton, N.Y., Candace Jones found herself confiding\nin him about her problems renovating the hotel and managing her\nstaff.\n\n   The guest, Anthony Dottino, president of the Dottino Consulting\nGroup in Old Tappan, N.J., suggested that she let him take a crack\nat solving the problems. Ms. Jones agreed, joining a list of\nclients _ including IBM, Consolidated Edison, British Airways and\nJohnson & Johnson _ that have sought Dottino's help with business\napplications of brain research.\n\n   Contending that managers need to make use of ``intellectual\ncapital,'' Dottino has created what he calls a comprehensive mental\nliteracy program to help employees unleash their creative energies.\n``The human being has unlimited creativity if focused and nurtured\nproperly,'' he said.\n\n   And he is far from alone. Although some neuroscientists dismiss\nthe trend, business people are increasingly using pop neurology or\n``neurobics'' _ brain teasers, puzzles and cognitive exercises _ in\nthe belief that mental workouts enhance job performance, just as\naerobic workouts build fitness.\n\n   ``Baloney,'' said Dr. Michael Gruber, director of neuro-oncology\nat New York University Medical Center, adding there was no\nscientific evidence to support neurobics.\n\n   His colleague, Dr. Carol Maxfield, a neuropsychologist in the\ncenter's psychiatry department, conceded, however, that the new\nbrain programs might have a placebo effect on users. ``On a\npsychological level, if someone does a group of exercises that they\nreally believe will help them concentrate, they just might,'' she\nsaid.\n\n   Professor Elizabeth Gould, a neurobiologist in Princeton\nUniversity's psychology department, said that while mental\nexercises were likely to enhance brain functioning, ``reading,\nplaying the piano or doing any number of different hobbies that\ndon't involve passive participation are probably enough.''\n\n   On the other hand, William M. Jenkins, a former professor of\nneuroscience at the University of California at San Francisco,\nSchool of Medicine, has embraced the field, becoming vice president\nfor development at Scientific Learning, a company in Berkeley,\nCalif., that uses brain research and technology to develop products\nintended to enhance human learning and performance.\n\n   ``Scientists have found that the brain is capable of altering\nits connections,'' Jenkins said. ``The brain learns best through\nassociations, by linking new information to existing information in\nsynergistic fashion. You have the ability to change the synaptic\nconnections within the brain.''\n\n   At the Holiday Inn, Dottino met with the staff and encouraged\nthem to speak freely about their boss, while teaching them to draw\nmind maps _ visual tools that resemble family trees but link words,\ncolors and pictures to express thoughts and ideas.\n\n   ``It's a map of thinking that one has on a particular topic,''\nsaid Dottino, co-author of ``The Brain Smart Leader'' (Gower,\n1999). ``It maps one's neural patterns, or thoughts, in an\nassociative and connected fashion.''\n\n   In the process, Ms. Jones' employees expressed feelings that her\nmanaging style was too didactic and controlling and that she\ntreated them like children. Dottino invited her into the meeting,\nand they then told her how they felt. ``It wasn't easy listening,\nbut it was a positive step because it forced me to come to grips\nwith things I needed to improve on,'' she said.\n\n   Dottino came to neurobics after a career in financial and\nexecutive management at IBM, and while he is not a neuroscientist,\nhe is a convincing and passionate speaker, whose clients point with\nsatisfaction to the results he has achieved.\n\n   Advertising sales through Oct. 1 at WMXJ, a Miami radio station,\nfor example, were 10 percent ahead of a year earlier, after the\nstation's employees worked on mind maps with Richard Israel, a\ncolleague of Dottino's, according to Dennis Collins, senior vice\npresident for the station.\n\n   Richard Bannon, former director of corporate accounting services\nat IBM in Endicott, N.Y., recalled that the company was\nrestructuring and undergoing major layoffs when Dottino was doing\nconsulting work for IBM in 1992. ``Because of all the tension,\npeople were in a major state of paralysis,'' Bannon said.\n\n   So he brought in Dottino, who had employees map their issues.\n``The first time my boss saw me doing a mind map, he told me to\nstop doodling,'' Bannon recalled. Nevertheless, he said, using\nDottino's methods, he was able to increase productivity in his\ndepartment enough to avoid more than two dozen planned job cuts in\nthe 18 months the consultant was there.\n\n   Business people who want to test the idea of a mental workout\ncan do so easily without calling in a consultant. Numerous Web\nsites offering memory- and attention-improving products have popped\nup, including a mind map software program call Mind Manager\n(www.mindmanager.com).\n\n   Among the others are supermemo.com; brain.com; neurobics.com,\nand enchantedmind.com, which presents a new set of puzzles weekly.\n\n   The Columbia University School of Business has expressed\ninterest in Brain.com's services, especially Thinkfast, a series of\nbrain teasers and IQ tests.\n\n   Al Thorrez, co-owner of Al Thorrez Industries, a maker of\nautomotive, tractor and office furniture parts in Jackson, Mich.,\nwas so impressed with Brain.com's products _ ``They increased my\ndecision-making and ability to think clearly,'' he said _ that he\ninvested in the company. He also said he had found its 12-minute IQ\ntest an effective way to screen job applicants.\n\n   Bannon, now controller at Maxtor, a disk drive maker in San\nJose, Calif., said, ``We've been taught that as we get older, we\nlose our memory.'' But that need not be so, he contended. ``The\nolder you get, the more connections and associations your brain\nshould be making,'' he said, ``Therefore you should have more\ninformation stored in your brain. You just need to tap into it.''\n\n   David Hill, a systems specialist at Con Edison, has similar\nfeelings. In the past, new employees at the company's nuclear power\nplant in Buchanan, N.Y., were given thick notebooks; now they learn\nwith mind maps _ a great way to convey ``dry, boring material,''\nHill said.\n\n   ``Mind-mapping, mental skills and intellectual capital are the\nthings that will make the difference in the next 100 years,'' Hill\nsaid. ``It's the wave of the future.''\n","Headline":"\nCAN `NEUROBICS' DO FOR THE BRAIN WHAT AEROBICS DO FOR LUNGS?  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) \n","Text":["\n   Three years ago, in chatting with a guest at the Holiday Inn she\nmanages in Binghamton, N.Y., Candace Jones found herself confiding\nin him about her problems renovating the hotel and managing her\nstaff.\n","\n   The guest, Anthony Dottino, president of the Dottino Consulting\nGroup in Old Tappan, N.J., suggested that she let him take a crack\nat solving the problems.
