He said he\ndidn't have the words to express his happiness.\n\n   But lots of people do. That home run did more than help the\nBraves beat the Colorado in the season opener; it lifted up a\ncommunity of cancer patients.\n\n   They might not be studious baseball fans, but they are expert in\nwords like multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n\n   They also know cancer doesn't care if you hang curve balls or\ndry wall. They all relate to the road Galarraga traveled to return\nto first base at Turner Field.\n\n   For cancer patients, watching Galarraga's comeback _ a defensive\nplay that saved Opening Day; four home runs in the first six games,\nincluding a grand slam that beat the Giants _ has been inspiring.\n\n   He has rewritten the definition of ``hero.''\n\n   ``I thought the guys that could throw for 400 yards in a game or\ncatch five touchdown passes or run for three touchdowns were\nheroes,'' said Kim King, the former Georgia Tech quarterback and\nradio analyst who has cancer in his back. ``But true heroes are\npeople that do things under pressure, with grace and style.\nGalarraga, he's a real hero.''\n\n   King was home watching the Braves' opener a couple of weeks ago.\nWhen Galarraga put Pedro Astacio's fastball into the\nleft-centerfield seats in the seventh inning, tears filled King's\neyes.\n\n   ``I was just bawling like a baby,'' King, 54, said. ``Chills\nwere going up and down my spine.''\n\n   It was a moment of triumph and joy that only someone who has had\nto endure chemotherapy or radiation, or both, could comprehend\nfully.\n\n   ``It was just a great victory, because I can share with what\nhe's been through this last year,'' King said. ``All the chemo and\nthe sickness and all the side effects you go through. And all the\npain and the discomfort of the back. It makes you feel like a dog.\nTo see him come back and do that was just great.''\n\n   Last summer, King kept feeling a pain in his back while playing\ngolf. ``Like an idiot, I guess, my football training told me you're\nsupposed to play through pain,'' he said. But he fell to his knees\nafter hitting a drive and couldn't continue.\n\n   The first doctor he saw told him it was bone spurs, nothing to\nworry about. Then it got worse, and his personal doctor discovered\na crushed vertebra. Further tests revealed worse news.\n\n   ``They diagnosed me in June, saying that I had multiple\nmyeloma,'' King said. ``It's a blood cancer that manifests itself\nin tumors and in the bone system, primarily in the hip and spine.''\n\n   King began intense treatments right after the Fourth of July. He\njust finished his second bone-marrow transplant. ``I'm pretty well\nfinished with the real heavy treatment,'' he said.\n\n   His doctors are encouraged with his progress. ``My back is\npretty well healed,'' King said. ``I'm able to do a lot of the\nthings that I was doing before, but not as well. I'm not able to\nplay golf the way I used to, but I can play golf and do some\nhunting and things like that. I haven't responded like Galarraga\nhas.''\n\n   That's why he admires Galarraga.\n\n   ``I think what he symbolizes is, if you catch (that you have)\ncancer early enough, you have a very good chance of beating it or\nat least containing it to where you can lead a full, productive\nlife,'' King said. ``The key for me was having regular annual\ncheckups.''\n\n   Galarraga might not understand how big a symbol he has become.\nBut he got a clue during spring training. On March 5, before the\nBraves' exhibition against Tampa Bay, he was visited by youngsters\nfighting cancer.\n\n   They sat in the dugout talking baseball. And cancer. Mark\nDaugherty, 7, treated for leukemia since he was 2, wanted to know\nall the details of Galarraga's illness.\n\n   ``Andres answered every question and pinpointed where it was,''\nsaid Steve Daugherty, Mark's father. ``He talked about the\nradiation and the chemo that he had. He said he did lose his hair,\njust like Mark, and it was a little painful. He did get a little\nsick. The same thing Mark goes through every week.''\n\n   It was a boost to the boy, who plays soccer and practices even\non days that he gets chemo.\n\n   ``Because of seeing some of the successes that he has been\naround and, obviously, the Andres thing, he doesn't miss a\npractice,'' Steve said.\n\n   An ex-tennis pro, Steve said he thinks that Galarraga's example\nhelps the mental attitude of cancer patients, which may play a\nsignificant part in recovery. ``It's probably 49 percent as\nimportant as the 51 percent of the medical side of it,'' he said.\n``You've got to be positive and upbeat every day.''\n\n   Rufus Guthrie, at 58 ``too damn young for this,'' is trying\ndesperately to be positive and upbeat, but some days it's just not\nthere. The former lineman for Tech and the San Diego Chargers has a\nbrain tumor.\n\n   ``I've got a glyoblastoma in a stage four, which is the worst\nyou can have,'' Guthrie said. ``Isn't that the way hurricanes come\nin, stage fours or fives? This is worse. It's a turbulent stage.''\n\n   At Thanksgiving, his left arm went numb and paralyzed. He has\nbeen undergoing treatment since December, radiation since February.\n\n   ``I wish I could say the worst is behind me. I don't even know\nthat,'' Guthrie said. He recently built a golf driving range in\nAtlanta to operate with his children, but his future is uncertain.\n\n   Still, there's the beacon of hope in a Braves uniform.\n\n   ``Galarraga's situation is an inspiration to me to hang on and\nwork hard to get back to the position he's in, but I don't know\nwith a brain tumor if I'm going to get there,'' Guthrie said. ``I\nknow he had a tumor on his back.\n\n   ``He's having a hell of a year playing baseball,'' he said.\n``It's miraculous, isn't it? I imagine he's giving a lot of people\na lot of hope. For a lot of people with cancer, there ain't a lot\nof hope.''\n\n   Norma Campbell, 35, is bursting with hope and happiness now that\nher eight-month battle with breast cancer is nearing a successful\nend.\n\n   ``I know exactly how Galarraga feels,'' Campbell said. ``Like a\ngiant, like he can conquer the world, like nothing else can bother\nyou or tear you down. I share how he feels right now.''\n\n   She also shares how he felt when he was diagnosed. ``I was\ndiagnosed in September. I was only 35. No one in my family had had\nit,'' Campbell said. ``I was too young to even go for the\nmammograms because they say start at age 40. It was devastating.''\n\n   Campbell, who works in a medical office, had her last treatment\nlast week. She said she feels like a new person.\n\n   ``Cancer for me has been more like a blessing and I would have\nnever traded it,'' she said. ``I know it sounds kind of crazy. It's\ngot me so in tuned with myself. That's why I say I can relate to\nhow Galarraga feels. It's like a rebirth. You come out fighting.\nThe small things in your life are nothing anymore. It's been a good\nthing for me.''\n\n   If they did not share a common disease, Campbell probably never\nwould have heard of Galarraga.\n\n   ``To be honest, I don't follow baseball that much,'' she said,\n``but the fact that he had the non-Hodgkins lymphoma, that sparked\nme to get into what he was doing.''\n\n   Now she thinks she will finish the novel that she has been\nwriting for three years. ``I think that the Lord kind of brought me\nthrough this because I was really struggling with a character that\nwas supposed to have gone through this illness. That's probably\ncrazy, but since the day I finished my treatment, I have been\nwriting like crazy.''\n\n   Because of the colon cancer that he was diagnosed with in\nDecember, Nick Peterson, 35, can't hang dry wall anymore. But he is\nbattling back, inspired by what Galarraga has done and by his two\nchildren, Ashley, 13, and Mitchell, 11.\n\n   ``I've got to raise my young-uns,'' Peterson said, ``so I want\nto be around a little bit longer.''\n\n   Peterson's been encouraged by a surgery that removed a foot and\na half of his colon and chemotherapy that has reduced seven tumors\non his liver to one. It hasn't been an easy battle. ``Just the\nthought of going through the chemo on Fridays makes me sick to my\nstomach,'' he said.\n\n   A former baseball player, he appreciates what Galarraga has\ndone. ``It's unbelievable, really,'' Peterson said. ``I didn't\nthink he was going to play baseball again. He sure has proved\neverybody wrong, hasn't he?''\n\n   Sue Klodnicki identifies with Galarraga's status as a survivor.\nHer lung cancer has been in remission for two years. The teacher's\naide dedicates a lot of her time to a cancer-support group at the\nCatholic Church of St. Ann.\n\n   ``Most people, as soon as they're diagnosed with cancer, think\nit's a death sentence,'' Klodnicki, 43, said. ``I want them to\nrealize that there's hope. I'm trying to show that it can be\novercome.''\n\n   Like Galarraga, whom she cheered in that first game.\n\n   ``I think Galarraga's doing a great job of it, going out there\nand playing ball like he's never been sick,'' Klodnicki said.\n``People always call it being sick. Well, I was never sick.
