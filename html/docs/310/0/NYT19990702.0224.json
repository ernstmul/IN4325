Times News Service   \n\n   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ It is illegal to drive while talking on a cell\nphone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the only place in\nAmerica with such a ban.\n\n   Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is in his 52nd year in office, and who\ncan recall when people survived without driving automobiles or\ntalking on telephones, let alone doing both at once, believes it is\njust a matter of common sense.\n\n   ``Things have gotten a little out of hand, don't you think?''\nsaid Coyne, noting that some cars now have computers, fax machines,\neven televisions. ``Pull off the road if you want to use an\nelectric shaver, if you want to put on lipstick, if you want to use\na cell phone. But if you're driving, for goodness sakes, then keep\ntwo hands on the wheel.''\n\n   Surrounded on three sides by the city of Cleveland, this older\nsuburb of factories, strip malls, modest bungalows and ranch\nhouses, with a population of about 11,000, might not seem like a\ntrend-setter. But it was Brooklyn, in 1966, that passed the first\nlaw in the nation to require the use of seat belts.\n\n   Talking on the phone while driving here carries a penalty of\n$100, plus $45 in court costs. So far, the police have only issued\nwarnings. More than 100 people have been stopped for the offense\nsince the ordinance took effect in March.\n\n   The grace period will end ``in a reasonable time period,'' said\nCoyne, after the town posts some no-talking-while-driving signs and\npeople become familiar with the law.\n\n   Police Chief James Maloney said he thinks most people know about\nthe law by now. ``When a squad car passes, you see them jump off\nthe phone and hide it under the dash.''\n\n   Support for the ban was fueled by an accident near City Hall,\nwhen the automobile of an elderly motorist was rammed by a driver\ntalking on his cell phone.\n\n   Maloney witnessed the accident. ``The guy was so engrossed in\nhis telephone conversation, he just slammed into the car stopped in\nfront of him at the light,'' Maloney said. ``Even after the crash,\nthe guy still had the phone in his ear.''\n\n   Except for Brooklyn, no town or state outlaws talking on the\nphone while driving, according to Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington. But\nsome countries, including Israel, ban cell phones while driving.\n\n   Hurd said the federal safety agency, while cautioning that\nphones can be a distraction for some drivers, has not focused on\nthem as a particular danger.\n\n   There are about 35 million cell phones in the United States, a\nfigure that is growing fast. Not so many years ago, cell phones\nwere seen as a toy for hard-charging business executives or those\nwho liked extravagant flourishes. But they have become fixtures of\nmiddle-class life.\n\n   Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications\nIndustry Association, a trade group that opposes the Brooklyn law,\nsaid the issue is not the telephone, but the driver. He said the\ntelephone industry has been running ads and sending mail to remind\npeople to drive safely while using a cell phone. Some states,\nincluding California, Wisconsin and Utah, have campaigns that do\nthe same.\n\n   Wheeler said there are many things besides a telephone that\ncould distract a driver, such as ``the kid in the backseat.''\n\n   ``While driving, with or without a cell phone, you have to\nexercise a series of good judgments,'' Wheeler said. ``Should I\nturn around now and look at the kids in the back? Is this a good\ntime to change the radio station? Is it the right time to have an\nargument with my spouse?''\n\n   He said new technology has often sparked worries about road\nsafety. Some states once drafted legislation to ban radios from\ncars.\n\n   He added: ``When windshield wipers were first introduced, people\nsaid, `These things are going to be hypnotic _ people won't be able\nto drive _ better stay with the goggles.''\n\n   Far from being a terrible hazard, cellular phones, in Wheeler's\nview, have made American roads safer.\n\n   He said nearly 100,000 calls a day are being made from cars,\njust to ask for help.\n\n   In Brooklyn, the ban on driving and talking has prompted mixed\nreactions.\n\n   ``It's a crazy law,'' said Tony Justice, a 35-year-old foreman\nat an electroplating factory, who said he depends on a cell phone\nto make arrangements to pick up his daughter after work. ``Some\npeople can actually talk and drive. And for people who can't\nfunction, well then, just ticket them for bad driving.''\n\n   But in the view of Dan Peters, a 27-year-old tile installer,\njail time would be too easy for some chatty drivers. ``They speed\nup, slow down, speed up, hit the breaks,'' said Peters. ``I think\ntheir driving follows the rhythm of their phone conversations. It\ndrives me crazy. They should pass this law everywhere.''\n\n   The mayor has fielded more than a few calls about the town's\npolicy, most of them positive.\n\n   Some of the calls have been dialed from cell phones in traffic.\n\n   ``It's gotten to be such a part of people's lives,'' Coyne said,\n``they can't help themselves.''\n\n   For passing motorists who might not be familiar with the local\nways of Brooklyn, the mayor said, the police show some\nunderstanding.\n\n   ``We tell them, `Look, there's a law in Brooklyn, so please get\noff the phone.'''\n","Headline":"\nPHONING AND DRIVING DON'T MIX IN CLEVELAND SUBURB \n","Text":["\n   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ It is illegal to drive while talking on a cell\nphone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the only place in\nAmerica with such a ban.\n","\n   Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is in his 52nd year in office, and who\ncan recall when people survived without driving automobiles or\ntalking on telephones, let alone doing both at once, believes it is\njust a matter of common sense.\n","\n   ``Things have gotten a little out of hand, don't you think?''\nsaid Coyne, noting that some cars now have computers, fax machines,\neven televisions. ``Pull off the road if you want to use an\nelectric shaver, if you want to put on lipstick, if you want to use\na cell phone.
