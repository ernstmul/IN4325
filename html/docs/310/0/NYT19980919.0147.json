Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Carol Hochberg, an investment banker who turned a\ndiagnosis of breast cancer into a life of advocating for fellow\nsufferers, died of the disease on Wednesday at her home on the\nUpper East Side of Manhattan. She was 40.\n\n   When Ms. Hochberg learned of the cancer, her first reaction was\nto fight, said her mother, Audrey Hochberg, a Democratic\nassemblywoman from Scarsdale, N.Y.\n\n   ``We have to get out there and kick,'' Carol Hochberg said in a\nNew York Times interview in 1995. She channeled her anger and\nenergy into Share, a lobbying and self-help group for women with\nbreast or ovarian cancer. After seeking advice there, she rapidly\nbecame a volunteer, a board member and a lobbyist.\n\n   The cancer arrived, she once said, at a ``most opportune time.''\n\n   After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and earning\nan MBA at Harvard, she began working on Wall Street.

She quit her job\nand gave herself a year to figure out how to spend the rest of her\nlife. She read, visited relatives and friends, and traveled to\nAntarctica, Brazil and the Galapagos Islands.\n\n   Before the year was over, she learned that a lump in her left\nbreast was cancerous. ``She leaned into it,'' said Alice Yaker, who\nrecently retired as Share's executive director, referring to both\nthe disease and the cancer support center.\n\n   Ms. Hochberg recalled in 1995: ``I was waiting for something to\nbe committed and enthusiastic about. I guess I took cancer as a\nsign.''\n\n   Ms. Hochberg, who believed that knowledge was control, read\nevery article, book and online file she could find about breast\ncancer. She volunteered on the Share phone line, answering the\nquestions of other women with the disease. She kept in touch with\ncallers who seemed to be especially alone, like a young Chinese\nwoman who had recently arrived in New York. She introduced a more\nsophisticated system of budgeting and financial planning to Share.\nAnd she helped to raise money, persuading relatives and Wall Street\nfriends to contribute, and donating some of her own money.\n\n   And she immersed herself in the politics of breast cancer,\nworking to get insurance coverage for women who were uninsured or\nentering clinical trials, and in the financing of medical research.\n\n   She became a dedicated lobbyist, frequently traveling to Albany\nand Washington to persuade legislators to support breast cancer\nissues. She spoke to President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, about\nthe need for more money for cancer research, and, on a panel with\nVice President Al Gore, she described her experiences as a cancer\npatient.
