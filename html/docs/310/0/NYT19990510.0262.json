BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Having completed the first two phases of treatment for an early\nbreast cancer _ a lumpectomy and six weeks of radiation therapy _ I\nhave now begun the third and, in a way, the most exciting phase:\nfive years of daily treatment with the drug tamoxifen.\n\n   Unlike traditional cancer chemotherapy, tamoxifen does not kill\ncells and does not cause nausea and hair loss. Tamoxifen is more\nlike a growth regulator. It is an estrogen-like compound that acts\nin the breast as an antiestrogen, preventing the natural hormone\nfrom stimulating the growth of breast cancer cells.\n\n   Tamoxifen has been around for about 20 years. It was first used\nto treat advanced breast cancer, then to prevent recurrence of less\nadvanced disease. Now it is being used to prevent breast cancer\nfrom occurring in the first place in women at high risk of\ndeveloping the disease.\n\n   Factors that contribute to a woman's risk of developing breast\ncancer include being over 60, having a family history of breast\ncancer, having had a noninvasive breast cancer or precancerous\nbreast abnormalities, having begun to menstruate before the age of\n12 and having had no children or a first child after age 30.\n\n   I admit to being confused and disappointed when my surgeon\nannounced gleefully that my cancer was highly sensitive to hormone\nstimulation, as indicated by a test for estrogen and progesterone\nreceptors on the cancer cells. To me that meant I would probably\nnever again be able to take postmenopausal hormones, which could\nprotect my heart, bones and brain from premature deterioration and\nwhich prevented hot flashes and vaginal dryness.\n\n   The surgeon was pleased because being estrogen-receptor-positive\nmeant that my tumor was slower growing, and that I could reap the\nmaximum protection from tamoxifen, which has been shown to cut in\nhalf the risk of recurrence of the original breast cancer as well\nas the development of a second cancer in the opposite breast.\n\n   Estrogen receptors are found in about 65 percent to 80 percent\nof breast cancers in postmenopausal women and 45 percent to 60\npercent of cancers in premenopausal women. The higher the level of\nestrogen receptors in a woman's tumor, the greater the survival\nbenefit associated with taking the drug. Women whose cancers are\nestrogen-receptor-negative reap some benefit from tamoxifen as\nwell, suggesting that the drug has other as-yet undiscovered\nactions.\n\n   Studies have indicated that five years of daily tamoxifen is\nmore protective than one or two years and as good or better than\ntaking the drug for 10 years. Its protective effects have been\nshown to persist for at least five years after the drug is stopped.\n\n   Most exciting, last year tamoxifen was shown in a study of more\nthan 13,000 women to reduce by 50 percent the development of a\nfirst cancer in women considered at high risk for the disease. This\nmade tamoxifen the first drug found to prevent cancer, although it\nis still not known for sure whether the protection is permanent.\nBut tamoxifen may not be helpful in women who carry\ncancer-promoting mutations of the genes BrCa1 and BrCa2.\n\n   Dr. D. Lawrence Wickerham, an oncologist at Allegheny University\nin Pittsburgh and a co-leader of national tamoxifen studies, said,\n``The cancers that developed in tamoxifen-treated women tended to\nbe smaller and were found at an earlier stage,'' meaning they were\nmore readily cured. Describing other benefits found in the studies,\nWickerham said: ``Women taking tamoxifen suffered fewer bone\nfractures of the wrist, hip and spine and their cholesterol level\ndropped by 12 to 20 percent. Furthermore, there is no evidence that\ntamoxifen is associated with weight gain, depression, nausea or\ncancers of the ovary, liver and gastrointestinal tract.''\n\n   The effects of tamoxifen on the brain are unknown, though there\nis no evidence of any ill effect, like memory impairment.\n\n   But for all the good tamoxifen does, it has certain major and\nminor disadvantages. Like estrogen, it raises the risk of\ndeveloping a relatively uncommon cancer of the uterus, endometrial\ncancer, a disease that can be detected early through routine\nmonitoring and cured by surgery and, if needed, radiation therapy.\nIts other serious side effect _ one that is shared by estrogen as\nwell _ is an increased risk of blood clots, which are occasionally\nfatal. Nonetheless, Dr. V. Craig Jordan of Northwestern\nUniversity's cancer center, who did pioneering research on\ntamoxifen, said the survival benefit from the drug for a woman like\nme who has had breast cancer outweighs the risk of death from its\neffects on the uterus and blood by about 30 times.\n\n   Stimulation of the growth of the endometrium, or uterine lining,\nwhich could increase the risk of cancer, occurs in a small\npercentage of women who take tamoxifen. Nonetheless, women may be\nadvised to have a baseline uterine examination before starting\ntamoxifen, followed by annual checkups to see if the drug is\nstimulating growth of the endometrium. This examination can be done\nin a doctor's office as an endometrial biopsy or painlessly by\ntransvaginal ultrasound. A woman who experiences an unusual vaginal\ndischarge or bleeding while on tamoxifen should report that to her\ngynecologist without delay.\n\n   On a less serious note, tamoxifen also causes hot flashes in a\nquarter to a third of users and an annoying vaginal discharge in\nabout 5 percent to 10 percent of women. The hot flashes may\nseriously disrupt a woman's life. But they usually diminish with\ntime, and their intensity may be diminished by daily consumption of\nsoy products like tofu and ground flaxseed.\n\n   Tamoxifen, sold as Nolvadex, is the first of a new class of\ndrugs called SERM's, for selective estrogen receptor modulators.\nThese compounds compete with natural estrogen for a docking site on\ncells throughout the body. When these sites, called receptors, are\noccupied by tamoxifen, estrogen cannot hook on properly and exert\nits usual effects.\n\n   A more recent addition to this class is raloxifene, marketed as\nEvista, which seems to share most of the characteristics, both good\nand bad, of tamoxifen, and several other such drugs are in various\nstages of development. The ultimate goal is to find a compound that\ndoes all the good that estrogen does, including reducing the risk\nof heart disease and osteoporosis, stimulating brain cells and\npreventing menopausal symptoms, but that has none of estrogen's bad\neffects, especially raising the risk of cancers of the breast and\nuterus and causing blood clots.\n\n   Raloxifene, which is approved for the prevention of bone loss,\nalso appears to protect the breast and heart but without\nstimulating cell growth and cancer in the uterus. But like\ntamoxifen, it can increase clotting and induce hot flashes, and it\nis not yet known whether it is as good as or better than tamoxifen\nin preventing breast cancer.\n\n   A study to determine this, called STAR (for Study of Tamoxifen\nand Raloxifene), is just getting under way. The study, sponsored by\nthe National Cancer Institute, will involve 22,000 women and is\nexpected to last 5 to 10 years.\n\n   ``At the moment, it's too early to use raloxifene to prevent\nbreast cancer outside of a clinical trial,'' Wickerham said during\na teleconference sponsored by Cancer Care Inc. ``We don't yet know\nraloxifene's long-term benefits or risks.''\n\n   He suggested that women interested in possibly participating in\nthe STAR trial call the National Cancer Institute's hot line, (800)\n4-CANCER, or sign on to the Web site of the National Surgical\nAdjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (www.nsabp.pitt.edu).\n\n   More information on tamoxifen can be found in a new paperback\nbook, ``Tamoxifen,'' by Dr. John F. Kessler and Greg A. Annussek\n(Avon, $5.99).\n","Headline":"\nPERSONAL HEALTH: ROUND THREE IN CANCER BATTLE: A 5-YEAR DRUG\nREGIMEN \n","Text":["\n   Having completed the first two phases of treatment for an early\nbreast cancer _ a lumpectomy and six weeks of radiation therapy _ I\nhave now begun the third and, in a way, the most exciting phase:\nfive years of daily treatment with the drug tamoxifen.\n","\n   Unlike traditional cancer chemotherapy, tamoxifen does not kill\ncells and does not cause nausea and hair loss.
