Times News Service    \n\n   It should be no surprise to viewers of the hit movie ``Erin\nBrockovich'' that the science portrayed in the movie is not really\nscience. After all, this is a major motion picture coming out of\nHollywood. It comes from a fairy tale land where women are\nabnormally beautiful, men are lusciously handsome, where sex is\nunusually profligate and violence casual and frequent.\n\n   So if audiences are willing to suspend disbelief in every other\narena, why should anyone care about something so dull as the\nveracity of the scientific methodology?\n\n   Yet many scientists are offended by the movie, and it is worth\nasking why. The problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a\ngood yarn in which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys\nwin. It is not that they want to take sides in this litigation from\nyears past. Their complaint is more subtle: While it is easy to see\nthat the sex and violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for\nany but scientists to discern when science in movies crosses the\nline from verity to hyperbole and indoctrination.\n\n   And when the movie is based on a true story about a woman who\nreally is named Erin Brockovich, the questions of what is real and\nwhat is not become further muddled. Scientists suspect that\naudiences will decide that the fiction is that Erin Brockovich does\nnot actually look like Julia Roberts, who plays her, but that they\nwill assume that the science, of course, is fact.\n\n   That, to many scientists, is a tragedy that spoils the movie. In\nscience, how you reach a conclusion really matters. It is hard for\nscientists to enjoy watching a movie that ignores, as though it is\nirrelevant, the hard-won but ultimately glorious knowledge of how\nto decide when perceived risks are real and when they are not.\n\n   In the movie, Brockovich is a law office file clerk with a high\nschool education who stumbles upon a group of people in Hinkley,\nCalif, who have been visited by a Job-like plague of ailments.\nTheir illnesses include uterine cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin's\ndisease, cancer of the brain stem, gastrointestinal cancer,\nmiscarriages, chronic nosebleeds, asthma, heart failure and immune\nsystem disorders.\n\n   It turned out that the groundwater in Hinkley was polluted with\ntrace amounts of chromium (VI), a heavy metal. The polluter was\nPacific Gas & Electric.\n\n   In the movie, the case was clear. As Brockovich in the movie\ngathered medical histories from more than 600 Hinkley residents,\nshe never seemed to doubt that every ailment was caused by chromium\n(VI). In the end, Pacific Gas & Electric paid $333 million to\nsettle the case.\n\n   But, scientists said, the movie encouraged exactly the wrong way\nto think about data, elevating individuals' medical histories to\nthe level of proof and distorting the notion of risk. Scientists,\nseeing the evidence that so infuriated Brockovich, would be much\nmore cautious _ and skeptical. The first question to ask is whether\nresidents of Hinkley really did have more sickness than people\nliving elsewhere. And, if so, what illnesses are being discussed?\n\n   ``Everyone has symptoms,'' said Dr. John C. Bailar III, a\nprofessor of health studies at the University of Chicago. Half the\nadult population eventually gets cancer. One out of every 700\nchildren gets cancer before age 15, he said. Vague complaints, like\naches and pains and difficulty sleeping are ubiquitous. If people\nlook for diseases, they will find them.\n\n   The next red flag is the sheer number of diseases. ``Any time I\nsee half a dozen diseases attributed to some exposure, I get very\nnervous,'' Bailar said. Biological agents, he said, ``are very well\ntargeted.''\n\n   Vinyl chloride has been shown to cause liver cancer, but not\nasthma. Asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, but not\nbreast cancer or brain cancer. The list of illnesses that any\nchemical is known to cause is very short, said Dr. Stephen Safe, a\ntoxicologist at Texas A&M University. ``The list is not 10,000\ndiseases,'' he said.\n\n   Scientists would also ask if it is even plausible that chromium\n(VI) in drinking water was making hundreds of people gravely ill.\nOf course, both sides in the litigation that ensued over the\nHinkley groundwater contamination brought in their own scientific\nexperts, although that was not pursued in the movie, but federal\nagencies whose scientists were not involved in the litigation said\nevidence was lacking that chromium (VI) in groundwater caused a\nmyriad of health problems. The chemical's main problem, they said,\nis that it can cause lung cancer if workers inhale it as\nparticulates in large doses for long periods of time.\n\n   Dr. Lois Swirsky Gold, who directs the carcinogenic potency\nproject at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that\nErin Brockovich is billed as fiction.
