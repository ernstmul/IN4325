And if you were lucky enough to\nland an immediate daytime date, chances are it was on Super Bowl\nSunday, Easter or some other occasion when no one in their right\nmind would want to squeeze inside a donut-shaped machine with\nmagnets pounding in their ears.\n\n   The high-tech diagnostic devices are in such demand at hospitals\nacross the state that they're up and running 15 to 24 hours a day,\nwith considerable waits for anyone without a life-threatening\ncondition. That's why, even though they're one of the most\nexpensive machines in the hospital, many facilities are lining up\nto buy more, and most are running the ones they have as often as\nthey can.\n\n   All of which is a dramatic development considering that just a\ndozen years ago few doctors and fewer patients knew what a magnetic\nresonance imaging machine was. Over that time, and especially in\nthe last several years, the MRI has become the test of choice to\ndiagnose orthopedic injuries as well as problems in the brain and\nspine. And it's increasingly being used to pinpoint potential\nstrokes and heart attacks, as well as to guide surgeons operating\non the liver and prostate.\n\n   ``We have patients on the phone every day asking to be moved up,\nbegging to have their scans done sooner rather than later,'' says\nDr. Clare Tempany, director of clinical MRI at Brigham and Women's\nHospital in Boston. ``It's five to seven weeks now for an elective\noutpatient procedure.''\n\n   ``Mine is a great job to have because there's something new\nhappening with MRIs all the time. . . . The technology is\nimproving, the magnets are getting faster, and we're able to do\ndifferent things with them that we didn't dream about when they\nfirst came out.''\n\n   Doctors aren't the only ones turned on by all the new things\nMRIs can do. ``They saved my life, definitely,'' says Thomas\nMcArdle, a retired electrician who has had six of them in recent\nyears, including one last month at Brigham that found an aneurysm\nin his aortic artery and another in March that helped doctors there\ninsert radioactive seeds in just the right place to attack his\nprostate cancer.\n\n   ``They have come quite a way in just the quality of the\npicture,'' he says, adding that it more than makes up for the fact\nthat it now takes weeks to schedule a test.\n\n   To understand all the hoopla about MRIs, it helps to understand\nwhat the machines do, and how they have been transformed since they\nfirst started showing up in the early 1980s.\n\n   MRIs contain powerful magnets that make the positive-charged\nproton particles in the body line up in the same direction. Radio\nwaves are then transmitted towards the protons, which absorb the\nenergy, tilt and, as the waves are switched off, emit a signal that\nthe MRI measures and transposes into a picture.\n\n   Those pictures used to be fairly crude, but now they're getting\nbetter and better at zeroing in on everything from soft tissue and\nbone marrow to all organs of the body. And as the pictures\nimproved, so did the uses of the tests, moving from the brain to\nthe spine to the entire musculoskeletal system.\n\n   In practical terms that means that orthopedic surgeons can, for\nthe first time, get a clear look at whether cartilage is missing\nfrom the joint surface in a patient's knee without having to go in\nwith an arthroscope, which means the patient is less likely to end\nup needing surgery or having to be on crutches. They also can\ndetect subtle bone fractures that are too tiny for x-rays to pick\nup.\n\n   Progress has been equally spectacular in other areas of the\nanatomy, with MRIs now used to unmask and sort out lesions in the\nliver, to determine how bad a ruptured disk is and to see whether\neverything is going right with a pregnancy. A new type of magnetic\nimaging machine also has found a place in the operating room,\ngiving surgeons a real-time roadmap of where they are going in\ncutting tissue, attacking a tumor and performing other parts of the\noperation.\n\n   Then there's the heart, ``which is going to be the real\ngangbuster with MR technology,'' predicts Dr. Stephen Sweriduk,\nmedical director of Shields Healthcare Group of Brockton, Mass.,\nwhose 10 machines make it the biggest player in the Bay State's MRI\nbusiness. Tests already confirm that imaging can identify heart\ntroubles at a stage before they cause an attack or other damage,\nand those techniques are being finetuned to provide critical data\non the walls, valves, vessels and other parts of the coronary\nnetwork.\n\n   ``There are many different ways to look at the heart right now,\nfrom ultrasound and nuclear medicine to coronary angiography,''\nsays Sweriduk. ``But the newest MRI scanners are so fast they\nactually freeze cardiac motion, doing what all the other tests do\ncombined. . . . I think this will displace the other tests; you'll\nhave everything done in one stop and you'll be finished.\n\n   ``With that information we'll be able to decide who gets medical\ntherapy and who gets surgery.''\n\n   MRIs always have been harmless to patients, which is especially\nreassuring to anyone who worries about the radiation required with\nx-rays and CT scans. Now the per-procedure cost for insurance\ncompanies, which a decade ago ranged from $1,200 to $1,500, are\nabout a third of that, which relieves some of the concerns that\ninsurers have had about the proliferation of such tests. If a\ndoctor orders an MRI insurers typically pay the entire cost.\n\n   Add up the lower costs and expanded uses and you have a\ndiagnostic device that is booming, displacing many uses of x-rays\nand going head-to-head with the also-hot technology of CT scans,\nwhich is faster and better at providing images of some body parts\nbut not as precise with others. What that means for hospitals is\ngetting the most out of the MRI machines they have and asking the\nstate for permission to purchase new ones, and for patients it\nmeans a greater likelihood of using the procedure _ and having to\nwait in line.\n\n   At Massachusetts General Hospital, for instance, one MRI device\nis being used 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while the others\nrun from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Usage is equally intense at Beth\nIsrael-Deaconess, which has four scanners. And at New England\nMedical Center the volume of magnetic imaging tests is up 12\npercent in just the last year.\n\n   ``We're running at maximum capacity,'' says Dr. Daniel O'Leary,\nthe chairman of radiology at New England Medical. ``Waiting lines\nare growing well beyond two weeks now, and we've put in an\napplication for a second machine,''\n\n   As the technology takes off, prices of imaging machines are\ncoming down much the way they are for computers, although new\nmachines being developed for specialized uses like the ones in the\noperating room can cost more than $2 million.
