Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ When he is planning his workweek, Jared L. Gurfein, a\nManhattan lawyer, arranges some of his most important conferences\nnot for an office or lunch appointment, but for bumper-to-bumper\ntraffic.\n\n   On Friday afternoons in the summer, the long, slow drive from\nManhattan to the Hamptons in his BMW 328i is reserved for business\ncalls ``that require real focus,'' said Gurfein, 30.\n\n   While beach-bound traffic makes driving east on the Long Island\nExpressway excruciatingly slow, negotiations via conference calls\nwith clients and other people zip right along. When it comes to\ndiscussing a contract with the other side's lawyer, as long as the\ntask does not require extensive note-taking, there is no better\nplace than a good traffic jam for focusing the mind, or improving\nconference-call performance, he said.\n\n   ``Your quality of input is higher in the car, no question,'' he\nsaid. ``If you're in the office or your apartment, there are at\nleast 15 things you could be doing, but in the car, there's nothing\nelse to do but focus on the call. Plus you're moving forward.\nMentally, it puts me in the zone, and I can really concentrate on\nthe phone.''\n\n   With luxury cars offering increasing levels of comfort and\non-the-road activity options, like built-in computers with Internet\naccess, more drivers are adopting Gurfein's traffic-friendly\nattitude.\n\n   Many say that they are not only less flustered by bad traffic,\nbut also learning how to benefit from it, taking care of business\non the road or occupying themselves with built-in CD players,\ndashboard laptops, Palm Pilots and cell phones.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Traffic is getting worse. There are more cars than ever on the\nroad, and traffic delays are growing. On Long Island, for example,\nthe state Department of Transportation estimates that more than\n800,000 drivers travel to work by car during the morning rush, half\nof them on the Long Island Expressway and the Southern State\nParkway. Also, the number of miles driven by Long Islanders has\ndoubled since the 1970s, according to the state.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Most drivers say that delays are still delays, no matter what\nthey are driving. But even many hard-core traffic-haters\nacknowledge that jams are more tolerable in today's cars than in\nthose of yesteryear, in the era before cloth seats and automobile\nair-conditioning were standard, when the only driving amenity was\nAM radio.\n\n   Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic consultant in Manhattan, said that\ndrivers are becoming more impervious to traffic frustration\nprecisely because automobiles are equipped with more accessories\ndesigned to distract passengers from the fact that they are, after\nall, stuck in the car.\n\n   ``People are simply tolerating much more traffic than they used\nto,'' he said. ``There's less road rage everywhere. In traffic that\nwould make me pull my hair out, I'm looking around and people are\nplacid.''\n\n   Many transportation experts have long relied on an imprecise\ntraffic principle called the ``level of intolerability,'' which\nessentially holds that when traffic gets too unbearable, a certain\nnumber of frustrated drivers will give up and use mass transit,\npreventing permanent gridlock. But this phenomenon has been\ndisrupted, Schwartz said, because people are tolerating traffic\nbetter.\n\n   Joel Pelinger has converted his sport utility vehicle into a\nrolling office because ``when you're 12 miles from Manhattan and it\ntakes you an hour and a half to get there, you've got to find a way\nto cope with that.'' He spends 10 minutes every morning in the\ndriveway of his home in Haworth, N.J., setting up a desk he\nattaches to his dashboard.\n\n   It holds his laptop, his Palm Pilot, his Global Positioning\nSystem receiver and his three cell phones. To prepare for his\ndrive, he enters clients' numbers into the memory of one cell\nphone, and prints out his business notes in large 16-point\ntypeface. Pelinger, whose company, Solar Systems, relocates\ncomputer systems for businesses, spends several workdays a week on\nthe road visiting clients, and his monthly cell phone bills are\nabout $1,000.\n\n   ``I know I'm going to hit traffic, so I've learned to take\nadvantage of it to make it work on my side,'' he said.\n\n   Pelinger is not alone, according to Richard Retting, a senior\ntransportation engineer for the Insurance Institute for Highway\nSafety, in Arlington, Va. ``Commuter time is no longer just for\ndriving,'' he said. ``As the comforts of home and the efficiency of\nthe office creep into the automobile, it is becoming increasingly\nattractive as a work space. People can use cell phones and e-mail\nfrom their cars to take advantage of lost time in traffic.''\n\n   But, he added, ``As drivers are bombarded with distractions and\nso many other things to do than just drive, you can expect more\ncrashes.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   In fact, as the use of cell phones in cars has grown, so has\nconcern over its threat to driver safety. Many local governments,\nlike one in Marlboro, N.J., have passed laws banning phone use\nwhile driving.\n\n   But some drivers do not need the latest telecommuting\naccessories to cope with traffic. Jerry Della Femina, the\nadvertising executive who owns the Della Femina restaurants in\nManhattan and East Hampton, calls traffic ``a state of mind.''\n\n   Della Femina drives to the Hamptons from Manhattan on most\nweekends, usually during peak traffic, he added proudly. ``It's an\noccasion,'' he said. ``I actually look for traffic sometimes. I\nmake the most of those hours.''\n\n   During the week, he records CDs of songs downloaded from the\nInternet. He lights a cigar and hops into his Mercedes convertible\n(or his Mercedes SUV if he is taking the family). Without traffic,\nthe 100-mile drive to East Hampton would take slightly more than\ntwo hours.\n\n   ``It's to the point where traffic has become a forced leisure\ntime,'' he said. ``Of all the great things in life, to be in your\ncar with your family listening to music _ it's delicious. So what\nif it takes four hours?''\n\n   In some cases, it is not just the driver, but the car, that\nmakes a difference. Israel Joffe, 20, a student at Adelphi\nUniversity who lives in Lawrence on Long Island, said that when he\nencountered traffic while driving his ``hunk of junk'' 1997 Saturn,\nhe became maniacal. But caught in the same traffic in his parents'\nnew Lexus, with its leather seats, dashboard computer and six-CD\nchanger, he was as docile as a lamb.\n\n   ``It's the difference between flying first class and coach,'' he\nsaid. ``Would you rather be sitting in a nice SUV or some crummy\nJoe Schmo car?''\n\n   When Henry Larsen of Manhattan used to drive his rusty 1979 Ford\nMaverick out to the Hamptons years ago, his leg cramped up from\noperating the clutch. The car had sticky, cracked vinyl seats, a\nsqueaky eight-track tape player and no air-conditioning or power\nsteering. The engine overheated frequently.\n\n   But for him, traffic lost much of its sting when SUVs came out.\nAt 4 p.m. on Fridays, he and his friends head out to East Hampton\nin the roomy leather interior of his silver 1999 Jeep Cherokee.\n\n   He said he coped with the traffic by using his six-CD changer\nand cell phone, and a laptop computer plugged into the dashboard.\nLarsen, 28, a finance coordinator at an employment agency, said he\nmade dinner, movie and weekend reservations online from his Jeep.\n\n   One feature he rarely uses on his Jeep is the four-wheel drive.\n\n   ``No one really needs an SUV,'' he said. ``People get them for\nthe comfort zone. You're up higher, and it's a way to stay above it\nall.''\n\n   But for those down below who do not have all the latest frills,\nlife on the road is not so rosy.\n\n   Catherine Hutton sat stuck in traffic last weekend on the Grand\nCentral Parkway in Queens. President Clinton was in town, and the\npolice had shut the Triborough Bridge, backing up traffic for\nmiles.\n\n   Most of the drivers around her were in late-model cars with the\nwindows shut and the air-conditioning blasting.

But with no working air-conditioner, she had\nthe windows of her 1986 Toyota Corolla rolled down.\n\n   ``If I'm a minute late, I lose a day's pay,'' yelled Hutton, who\ndrives a city bus in the Bronx and is sent home if she does not\narrive on time. She allows more than two hours for her drive from\nHoward Beach to the bus depot, but even this is sometimes\ninsufficient in awful traffic. Then she looked around and said:\n``No one cares.
