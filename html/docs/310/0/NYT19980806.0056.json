They hope these therapies will bring outlaw cancer cells\nback into good behavior or prod irrevocably damaged cells into\napoptosis, or cell suicide.\n\n   If conventional chemo is like bombing an entire city to kill off\na guerrilla force, the newer drugs aim to pick off the enemy and\nspare the civilians.\n\n   ``I've never seen so many ways to attack cancer,'' says Coffey.\nIndeed, a survey this year by an industry group showed that of 350\nbiotech drugs under development, 151 _ more than one-third _ target\ncancer. There were 30 for melanoma alone, 20 for colo-rectal\ncancer, and 13 each for prostate and breast cancers.\n\n   And, as reports at this spring's meeting of the American Society\nof Clinical Oncology reflected, the early tests of many of these\nagents are promising.\n\n   ``I've never seen so many positive results in my life,'' says\nDr. Dan Von Hoff, founder of ILEX Pharmaceuticals and an oncologist\nat the San Antonio Cancer Institute. ``The biology is beginning to\npay off. Now you can sit down and look a patient in the eye and say\nthere's a good chance of this doing you good.''\n\n   Despite a flurry of media reports this spring proclaiming that a\ncancer ``cure'' might be at hand, few scientists will touch that\nword. Sobered by decades of experience with cancer's Houdini-like\nability to escape and survive, researchers say the new agents may\nrealistically prove more successful at taming cancer than\ndestroying it.\n\n   ``We may have cures someday,'' says Samuel Waksal, president of\nImClone Systems Inc. in New York, which is developing targeted\ncancer therapies, ``but the types of approaches we're developing\nnow may make cancer a chronic disease. We would like to kill every\ncancer cell, but we're recognizing that if you can keep people\nalive for 30 more years, using drugs with few side effects _ that's\npretty dramatic.\n\n   ``And,'' he adds, ``that's a goal that is achievable in the near\nterm.'' Even in the next two or three years, ``the world (of cancer\ntreatment) is going to change.''\n\n   For ethical reasons, the newest drugs are tried first in\npatients with hopelessly advanced cancer. Despite the grim odds,\none such drug is already sparking a glimmer of hope for patients\nwith aggressive, incurable brain tumors called glioblastomas. The\ndrug, called SU101, blocks an overactive cell growth-signaling\npathway in brain cells and has kept a few patients alive for one or\ntwo years. Under normal circumstances, they would have died within\nthree months, says Dr. Eric Wong, a neuro-oncologist at Boston's\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where the drug is about to\nbegin testing.\n\n   Last month, Nelba MacMurdo, 66, of Canton, finished her first\nseven-week course of SU-101: Her children had read about the\nexperimental drug in a newsmagazine and sought out Wong. Whether it\nhas affected the brain tumor whose tentacles couldn't be surgically\nremoved wasn't immediately clear. But her daughter, Leslie, says\nshe has experienced few side effects and has felt ``renewed zest\njust knowing there's something that could potentially help her.''\n\n   No one expects any of the new biological therapies, as effective\nas they may prove, to do the job alone. Most researchers believe\nthey will work best when combined with other therapies and with\nstandard chemotherapy drugs to attack the elusive cancer cell on\nmany fronts.\n\n   ``We don't have to hit a home run to cure people'' with newer\nagents, says Dr. Christopher Logothetis at M.D. Anderson. ``We just\nhave to get a base hit, because we already have one with\nchemotherapy _ this could give us a run batted in. That's why many\nof us are really optimistic that we're going to be able to change\nthe course of this illness.''\n\n   For example, ImClone's cancer drug C225, based on an antibody\ndiscovery by Mendelsohn, is being tested in combination with\nradiation for head and neck cancers. The radiation damages the cell\nwhile the C225 antibody blocks a chemical growth factor, the EGF\nreceptor, that the cell needs in order to divide. The one-two\nattack has proven successful in halting tumors in the early tests,\nsays Mendelsohn.\n\n   If they are cautiously optimistic that the new era of rationally\ndesigned drugs and targeted therapies may yield major inroads into\nthe disease, the researchers are also mindful of the potential\npitfalls.\n\n   Normal cells in body tissues are of one kind, but cancer cells _\neven in the same tumor _ are genetically diverse, points out Coffey\nat Johns Hopkins. ``Diversity allows cancer to survive'' by\nbecoming resistant to drugs that attack just one type of cell, he\nsays. ``Cancer is an evolutionary process that spins off variants\nyou can't control.''\n\n   Angiogenesis inhibitors may get around this obstacle because\nthey don't attack the cancer cell itself, only its blood supply,\nand the blood vessel cells that are the target don't develop\nresistance. In animal experiments, resistance to the angiogenesis\nagents has been remarkably absent.\n\n     \n   \nHurdles remain before drugs reach market\n\n     \n  \n\n   But there are other hurdles. Turning experimental proteins from\nthe laboratory into commercial-scale drugs is difficult. Many of\nthe proteins are large, complex, and difficult to make. Genentech\nis building a new manufacturing plant to churn out a drug called\nHerceptin for what is expected to be a large market, once it gains\nFDA approval. But these scale-ups take time and effort. Moreover,\nlarge proteins need to be taken intravenously; the hope is to\nproduce small molecules that patients can take orally.\n\n   Other researchers still labor to find better ways to test\npromising drugs in animals. Though scientists have worked for years\nto create mice that mimic human cancer, mice experiments still\noften don't predict what a drug will do in humans, and the search\nfor still better animal models continues.\n\n   Says Dr. Martin Abeloff, director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer\nCenter, ``We're all excited about the potential of really being\nable to attack this disease in a more scientifically-based\napproach. But we also have to be cautious, because we're learning\nabout the complexity of these processes.''\n\n   And, he says, it's not as if cancer treatment is moving into a\n``different universe.''\n\n   ``I don't feel like what we've done in the past'' with\nconventional treatments will be rendered obsolete, he says. ``We'll\nnever abandon them, even when we have the new biologically _ based\napproaches... we'll use them together.''\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   But now, scientists are developing drugs aimed at blocking the\neffects of mutant, cancer-causing oncogenes, restoring broken\ntumor-suppressor genes, and overcoming malfunctioning DNA-repair\ngenes.
