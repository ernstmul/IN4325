HALL \n       c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  \n\n        A protein that can help stop cancer by killing damaged cells\nmay turn out to be a major culprit in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n   Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco\nreport Tuesday that the protein known as p53, well-known for its\npivotal role in cancer and basic cell biology, can trigger the\ndeath of precious brain cells through interaction with another\nsubstance, called amyloid precursor protein.\n\n   The findings could lead to a new target for drug developers\nhoping to find a way to block the mysterious process that robs\nAlzheimer's disease sufferers of mental function.\n\n   The study, led by Lennart Mucke and Xiao Xu at UCSF's Gladstone\nInstitute of Neurological Disease, appears Tuesday in the latest\nissue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n   ``Most of what we know about p53 we learned from cancer\nresearch,'' Mucke said Monday. ``What we have here is an\ninteresting link between two major fields.''\n\n   Mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein, also known as APP,\nhave long been associated with Alzheimer's disease and the build-up\nof a toxic plaque in the brain. However, scientists have never\nquite understood just how the amyloid precursor protein can lead to\nthe demise of nerve cells.\n\n   Now, it appears that the normal form of APP inhibits p53 from\nswitching on a ``cell suicide'' process in the brain. This\nprotective function is absent in the mutant amyloid precursors.\n\n   This mutant APP is the same brain protein found in elevated\namounts in early-onset Alzheimer's cases known to run in families.\n\n   Earlier research by Mucke and UCSF professor Roger Nicoll showed\nthat mutant forms of APP lead to increased production of a\nbreakdown product, called amyloid-beta peptide, which in turn can\nlead to the hallmark buildup of plaque deposits in the brains of\nAlzheimer's patients.\n\n   The new study suggests that plaque build-up is not the only\nreason why brain cells may start to die off. If that turns out to\nbe correct, it means that preventing the plaque from forming may\nnot be an effective treatment in all cases of Alzheimer's.\n\n   Instead, a drug that also aims at the p53 pathway could be an\nimportant element.\n\n   The p53 ``cell suicide'' process is thought to be a good thing\nin cancer cases, essentially a natural system that halts the\nproliferation of damaged cells.\n\n   It's a much different story when the cells are mature, fully\nwired neurons in the brain _ the elemental circuitry built up by a\nlifetime of memory.\n\n   ``In cancer, you are trying to keep this p53 pathway active. In\nAlzheimer's, it may be helpful to keep it from being\noveractivated,'' Mucke said.\n\n   Finding a way to do that effectively may take a long time,\nprobably several years. But Mucke said the cancer research at least\nprovides a head start in understanding the basic biology.\n","Headline":"\nCANCER-FIGHTING PROTEIN MAY LEAD TO ALZHEIMER'S\n","Text":["\n   Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco\nreport Tuesday that the protein known as p53, well-known for its\npivotal role in cancer and basic cell biology, can trigger the\ndeath of precious brain cells through interaction with another\nsubstance, called amyloid precursor protein.\n","\n   The findings could lead to a new target for drug developers\nhoping to find a way to block the mysterious process that robs\nAlzheimer's disease sufferers of mental function.\n","\n   The study, led by Lennart Mucke and Xiao Xu at UCSF's Gladstone\nInstitute of Neurological Disease, appears Tuesday in the latest\nissue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n","\n   ``Most of what we know about p53 we learned from cancer\nresearch,'' Mucke said Monday. ``What we have here is an\ninteresting link between two major fields.''\n","\n   Mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein, also known as APP,\nhave long been associated with Alzheimer's disease and the build-up\nof a toxic plaque in the brain.
