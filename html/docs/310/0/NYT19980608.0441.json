His discovery was anything but\nsimple: the static was the first evidence that stars and galaxies\nwere emitting radio waves.\n\n   Karl Jansky's serendipitous discovery of what he called ``star\nnoise'' led to work in the field of radio astronomy in 1950, and\nthe rest is history _ or, more properly, cosmology. For it is\nthrough radio astronomy that scientists have confirmed much of what\nthey theorized about black holes, pulsars, and the lingering\nmicrowave signature of the Big Bang.\n\n   On Monday, armed with new details from recently discovered\nnotes, a group of scientists, including two Nobel Prize winners\nwhose own discoveries were made possible by Jansky's, gathered here\non the grounds of Bell Laboratories to dedicate a sculpture of the\noriginal device _ stylized and miniaturized _ on what is believed\nto be its original site.\n\n   Jansky died in 1950, and until his notes were found, the only\ntrace of his discovery was a sign that pointed vaguely toward a\ngrassy area of the company's research complex.

Jesse Greenstein, 89, an astronomer\nwho was one of the few to recognize its importance at first, said\non Monday that analysis of radio waves emanating from space\nprovided researchers with ``10,000 times the information'' that\nthey could get from optical astronomy.\n\n   ``It led to information that overturned the idea of a rationally\ndeveloping universe,'' he said, ``and replaced it with a\nrelativistic, ultra-high energy cosmos of scary, violent,\nuncontrollable forces like black holes and quasars. It was a\nrevolution.''\n\n   Grote Reber, 95, who in the 1930s and '40s duplicated Jansky's\nwork, recalled Jansky as ``a competent, energetic and mild-mannered\nperson.''\n\n   Jansky's sister, Helen Sanford, who came to the ceremony from\nher home in Ojai, Calif., attributed her brother's perseverance in\npursuing the source of the static despite the lack of interest by\nothers to his training as a physicist and their father's admonition\nto them as children to ``question everything.''\n\n   Joseph Taylor, a 1993 Nobel Prize winner and the discoverer of\npulsars, agreed. ``When you have a prepared mind ready to receive\nsome signal from nature, then you have real progress,'' he said.\n\n   At the time of Jansky's discovery the front page of The New York\nTimes of May 5, 1933, carried an account of a scientific paper\ndetailing the discovery of the star noise, under the headline ``New\nRadio Waves Traced to Centre of the Milky Way.''\n\n   Ten days later, between a Lowell Thomas news broadcast and a\nMarx Brothers show, radio's Blue Network broadcast an interview\nwith Jansky, complete with three 10-second-long live segments of\nactual static hiss emanating ``from the depths of the universe.''\nAt one point, the announcer told the listeners that they were tuned\nin to Sagittarius, the constellation at the center of the galaxy\nfrom which the waves emanated.\n\n   The New Yorker magazine, with a wry, world-weary tone in its\nTalk of the Town section, said at the time of the discovery that it\nwas ``believed to be the longest distance anybody ever went to look\nfor trouble.''\n","Headline":"\nEARLY RADIO ASTRONOMER IS HONORED  \n (HLW) \n","Text":["\n   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ His assignment from his bosses at Bell\nLaboratories in 1931 was simple: build a 100-foot-long rotating\nantenna to find out what was causing the static that interfered\nwith trans-Atlantic telephone calls.
