Henry Waxman of California said\non Monday.\n\n   New Congressional investigations into the 1993 standoff were\ntriggered by recent news reports that the FBI had failed to\ndisclose the use of the military-style canisters until this year.\nBut Waxman said congressional investigators were told about the\ncanisters during the last round of investigations in 1995.\n\n   The documents repeatedly refer to military canisters without\nspecifically mentioning the possibility that they can generate\nfire. No evidence has surfaced linking the tear gas to the fatal\nfire, which the government says was started by Davidian leader\nDavid Koresh and his followers.\n\n   ``I guess, hypothetically, maybe the staffs read over these\ndocuments and didn't understand the terms. Maybe they didn't think\nmuch about it,'' Waxman said. ``But the facts seem to be that the\nattorney general and her Department of Justice and the FBI sent the\nCongress, in 1995, documents that military tear gas was used.''\n\n   Waxman is ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform\nCommittee, chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who said on Monday\nthat he is expanding his committee's new investigation of the\nstandoff to look into whether FBI snipers fired into the compound\non the final day of the standoff.\n\n   Burton announced the expansion of the investigation after the\nTexas Rangers disclosed that they had collected a dozen spent rifle\ncasings from a house used by FBI snipers during the 1993 siege.\n\n   But the evidence was far from conclusive because the same house\nalso was used by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\nFirearms during their firefight with sect members on the first day\nof the standoff.\n\n   And the Rangers' report cites concerns raised not by the\nRangers, but by Colorado film researcher Mike McNulty, who last\nyear was allowed to review the evidence being held by the Texas\nDepartment of Public Safety.\n\n   ``Mike McNulty has questioned .308 Winchester cases located at\nthe undercover house, which may show that the FBI snipers fired\nrounds on 04-19-93,'' the report states.\n\n   FBI officials have repeatedly said that their agents did not\nfire during the 51-day confrontation that ended when a devastating\nfire roared through the compound. Koresh and about 80 of his\nfollowers died in the siege.\n\n   Burton said the evidence gathered by the Texas Rangers ``raises\nnew concerns that require further investigation by Congress.''\n\n   Other Justice Department critics said Waxman's findings\nconcerning the pyrotechnic tear gas canisters do not exonerate\nAttorney General Janet Reno or her subordinates because federal\nagents never highlighted the information.\n\n   ``In 1995, three days before the hearings, they dumped over\n100,000 pages worth of documents on the committee staff,'' Burton\nspokesman Mark Corallo said. ``I think it was up to them to point\nit out to us.''\n\n   Corallo also noted that Reno has said that she was unaware of\nthe incendiary canisters. Responding to news reports late last\nmonth, Reno expressed outrage that she did not know about their use\nin Waco. She had no immediate reaction to Waxman's disclosures.\n\n   The report from the Texas Rangers opens a new line of inquiry by\nraising the possibility that FBI snipers shot at the Branch\nDavidians. The Texas law enforcement agency released its report on\nthe Internet late Sunday after delivering copies of the document to\nBurton's committee and independent investigator John Danforth.\n\n   The Rangers said in their report that they reviewed selected\nitems from the 24,000 pounds of evidence after questions were\nraised about the use of the pyrotechnic canisters.\n\n   Most of the 11-page report contains highly technical information\nthat breaks down the type of casings found, the manufacturers who\nproduce the ammunition and quotations from manuals explaining the\nchemical breakdown of various tear gas canisters found at the\nscene.\n\n   One of the spent casings was from a 40mm cartridge reportedly\nused to knock down a door so gas could be dispensed, the report\nsays.\n\n   And as was expected, the report confirms the FBI's use of the\npyrotechnic tear gas grenades, which burn at 500 to 700 degrees\nFahrenheit and can ignite flammable items.\n\n   The report repeatedly cites concerns raised by McNulty, a\nlongtime critic of the government's handling of the siege.\n\n   ``Mike McNulty has advised me that other evidence held by the\nDPS is crucial to proving some of his suspicions that the FBI and\nATF have not been truthful in their account of the Branch Davidian\ninvestigation,'' Rangers Sgt. Joey D. Gordon wrote.\n\n   For example, McNulty asserts that a blue knit cap worn by a\nDavidian killed during the ATF raid might provide evidence that the\nman was shot at close range, which contradicts reports by ATF\nagents, who say he was shot from a distance.\n\n   The Rangers report includes several other photos and documents,\nincluding a letter Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston wrote to\nAttorney General Janet Reno in August in which he alleges a\ngovernment cover-up.\n\n   ``... I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept\nfrom you _ and quite possibly are being kept from you even now, by\ncomponents of the Department.''\n\n   The report also includes a June 1999 interoffice memo from\nRangers Sgt. George L. Turner, who says he recovered a ``Thumper\nRound'' from the scene, which was later identified as the 40mm\ncartridge believed to have been used to knock down the door.\n\n   The Thumper Round, which Turner's report says is highly\nexplosive, reportedly was fired by the FBI.\n\n   Turner notified Rangers and FBI officials of his findings, but\ndid not pursue the matter any further.\n\n   ``I never came forward with the information that would seem to\nindicate that an explosive projectile was fired on April 19,\n1993,'' Turner says in his memo. ``But I was never asked the\nquestion. If I had been, I would have naturally responded with the\ntruth.''\n\n   Turner said Rangers officials who testified in the 1995 Senate\nsubcommittee hearings were reminded of the ``possibility that an\nexplosive round having been fired.''\n\n   Danforth, appointed last week by Reno to investigate the final\nday of the siege, declined to comment on the Rangers' findings.\n\n   ``He is no longer commenting on anything,'' an aide to the St.\nLouis lawyer said.\n\n   In a related matter, justice department attorneys asked on\nMonday for a two-week extension in turning over information about\nexpert witnesses scheduled to testify at a lawsuit brought by\nBranch Davidians, the Associated Press reported.\n\n   Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the Branch Davidians, told AP\nthat while he does not object to the extension, it's another reason\nto delay the trial set for Oct. 18.\n\n   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr. has not ruled on the\nmotion.\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com) nn\n","Headline":"\nCONGRESS HAD EVIDENCE OF TEAR GAS CANISTERS IN 1995, DEMOCRAT SAYS\n","Text":["\n   Congress was given evidence four years ago that pyrotechnic tear\ngas canisters were used in the FBI raid on the Branch Davidian\ncompound in 1993, Democratic Rep.
