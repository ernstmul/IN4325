Times News Service    \n\n   BRICK TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Holding her tiny 6-month-old daughter\nclose to her shoulder, Heather Howarth talked about government\nscientists who had come into her town to study whether anything in\nthe environment was causing local children to develop autism, a\ndisorder that affects a child's ability to communicate and function\nsocially.\n\n   ``My husband heard about it on the radio, and he called to tell\nme, `If you let her drink the water, I'll kill you,''' Mrs. Howarth\nsaid, pulling a white sweater up protectively over her baby's head\nas she stood outside a shopping center here. ``I heard they found\n400 cases of autism here.''\n\n   There are not 400 cases of autism in this coastal town in Ocean\nCounty. There might be 40, but scientists are still verifying the\nnumber. And no one has said that there is anything wrong with the\ntown's water that might be causing autism.\n\n   But since last week, when news spread that the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention and another federal health agency\nwere investigating the incidence of autism in this town of 72,000,\nmany people here have become fearful that something about Brick is\nharming its children.\n\n   The alarm began when Bobbie and William Gallagher, who have two\nautistic children, noticed that there appeared to be many other\nchildren in their town with the same disorder. After some amateur\nepidemiological canvassing of their own, the Gallaghers and some of\ntheir friends with autistic children persuaded federal authorities\nthat an investigation was warranted.\n\n   A few years ago, it would have been unlikely that these parents\nwould have got such a prompt and attentive hearing from state and\nfederal officials. But the belief that clusters of cases of cancer\nand other illnesses might be caused by something in a community's\nair or water or soil is a recent phenomenon that has quickly\ndeveloped the power to arouse both panic among people and action on\nthe part of politicians _ although there is no scientific evidence\nthat such clusters are anything more than statistical flukes.\n\n   Although autism had never before been linked to environmental\ncauses, fears were easily roused here partly because this part of\nNew Jersey has many toxic waste sites that the state and federal\ngovernments ordered cleaned up. In nearby Toms River, parents of\nchildren with cancer persuaded state health officials to conduct a\ncomprehensive environmental study of Dover Township, which includes\ntheir town, to see whether these cases were somehow connected. The\nstudy is continuing.\n\n   ``It's scary,'' said Joanne Renz, a mother of two boys, ages 5\nand 3. ``I was listening to the news on the way to work and heard\nabout it. Toms River is just down the street from us, and you see\nthey've got problems with the water. We always drink the tap water\nhere, but it makes you wonder. Knock wood, my two boys are OK.''\n\n   Researchers for the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substance and\nDisease Registry, an agency created when Superfund toxic waste\nsites were designated for cleanup all over the country, said news\nmedia reports that they had found Brick Township's autism rate to\nbe 12 times higher than the national average were unfounded.\n\n   The investigation is not finished, and besides, scientists say\nthere are no reliable figures to determine a normal rate for\nautism.\n\n   But that has not stopped concerned parents and couples who are\nexpecting children from flooding the office of Mayor Joseph\nScarpelli with panicked phone calls.\n\n   ``Should we move out?'' asked a man whose wife is pregnant.\nAnother parent asked: ``We just closed on a house. Should we cancel\nour contract?''\n\n   Scarpelli said, ``We're telling people, until we narrow it down\nand get a definite conclusion, it's too early to speculate on the\ncause.''\n\n   But while the mayor tries to quell the panic, others have not.\nThe other day, for example, a law firm in nearby Middletown placed\na full-page advertisement in two Brick-area newspapers with the\nheadline, ``Is Contamination the Cause of Autism in Brick?'' The ad\ngave a toll-free number to call the firm, which promised to ``fight\nfor your legal rights'' against ``an identifiable polluter.''\n\n   The maelstrom began with the Gallaghers, whose two children were\nfound to have autism several years ago. When their daughter,\nAlanna, who is now 8, was less than 3 years old, she would spin\nwildly until it made her dizzy, and she would line up her stuffed\ntoys obsessively. She could also make only guttural noises at an\nage when other children were speaking in full sentences.\n\n   Autism, which varies in severity and has no known cause and no\nreal cure, is generally diagnosed in children when they are around\n3 years old. While autistic children may appear physically healthy,\nthey may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no\ninterest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like banging\ntheir heads. As adults, some people with autism are highly\nfunctional, while others never learn to speak and may require\ninstitutionalization.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Mrs. Gallagher, whose son, Austin, now 6, was later found to\nhave the disorder, began attending meetings of an Ocean County\nsupport group. After several months, she said, she noticed that\nmany families in the group were from her town, a working-class\ncommunity bisected by the Metedeconk River.\n\n   She and her husband, a commercial fisherman, began to think that\nthere might be something more than coincidence linking all these\ncases. More than two years ago, they decided to investigate, on\ntheir own, the extent of the problem in Brick.\n\n   The Gallaghers and Angela and Kevin Fryczynski, whose son Kevin\nis also autistic, first asked the local school system, which has\nspecial services for autistic children, for the names and addresses\nof families with autistic children, but school officials refused.\nSo, working with addresses from families in their support groups,\nthey plotted on a map where in Brick the autistic children lived.\nAs it turned out, they were spread out.\n\n   After distributing a flier and then putting an ad in a local\nnewspaper, the couples determined that at least 19 families living\nin Brick had autistic children who were born and conceived here.\nThey approached politicians with their findings.\n\n   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith of Trenton said the couples'\nresearch persuaded him to urge the C.D.C. to investigate. Although\nthe study was not scientific, Smith said he did not want to ignore\nany evidence that people might be in danger.\n\n   ``I came to the point of view that it would be irresponsible not\nto pursue it and get experts to look into it, but with science, not\nspeculation,'' Smith said.\n\n   With the urging of Smith and U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli,\nfederal health officials agreed to investigate the number of autism\ncases and to try to determine whether something in the area could\nbe causing them.\n\n   But even if it turns out that there are 40 cases of autism in\nBrick, there is still no measuring stick to compare that number\nwith, said Dr. Coleen Boyle, chief of developmental disabilities\nfor the CDC in Atlanta. The Brick study, along with one the CDC is\nconducting in the five-county area that includes Atlanta, could\nprovide such a standard, Dr. Boyle said.\n\n   By the fall, the CDC and the toxic substance registry hope to\nfinish identifying all the children in Brick between the ages of 3\nand 10 who have autism, and where they were born and conceived.\nWhile they told people at a recent town meeting that they know of\n40 children who have been found to be autistic, they have verified\nthe diagnoses of only 15 and are working on the rest. When they\nhave those findings they will determine how to proceed.\n\n   As another part of the study, researchers from the toxic\nsubstance registry are analyzing samples of soil and water from\nindustrial sites and residential areas, and locations of local\nchemical spills and waste dumping. Those sites include a town\nlandfill that was placed on the Superfund list and closed in 1972,\nand a packaging manufacturer that was ordered closed a few years\nlater after it was fined for polluting the Metedeconk River, which\nnow provides the town's drinking supply.\n\n   But the researchers emphasize that the cause of autism is still\nunknown.\n\n   Some studies have found that with fraternal twins, in only 10\npercent of cases in which one child had autism did both have it.\nWith identical twins, when one had it, the other had it in\ntwo-thirds of the cases, leading scientists to think there is a\nstrong genetic cause.\n\n   ``But what about the other third?'' asked Dr. Eric London of the\nNational Alliance for Autism Research outside of Princeton. ``The\ncurrent belief is that you need a genetic predisposition, and\nsomething else. What that something else is, we don't know.''\n\n   Various factors have been studied, London said, including\ntoxins, viruses, diet, drug or alcohol use by the mother during\npregnancy, and even the effects of certain inoculations. But no\ncause has been proved, he said, ``which is why this alleged cluster\nin Brick is so important to study.''\n\n   The mayor said he believes that the availability of special\nservices for autistic children _ including tuition at a private\nschool paid for by the public school system _ has drawn families\nwith autistic children to Brick, and that that has inflated the\nnumbers.\n\n   ``Some people don't want to believe there are any environmental\nproblems,'' Mrs. Fryczynski said. ``Maybe they're worried about the\nproperty values. But you know what I say? We live here, too, and my\nproperty values will go up or down or all around like everybody\nelse's, and I have two children, and I want to know what's causing\nthis problem.''\n","Headline":"\nAUTISM CASES BRING ALARM TO A NEW JERSEY TOWN\n","Text":["\n   BRICK TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Holding her tiny 6-month-old daughter\nclose to her shoulder, Heather Howarth talked about government\nscientists who had come into her town to study whether anything in\nthe environment was causing local children to develop autism, a\ndisorder that affects a child's ability to communicate and function\nsocially.\n","\n   ``My husband heard about it on the radio, and he called to tell\nme, `If you let her drink the water, I'll kill you,''' Mrs. Howarth\nsaid, pulling a white sweater up protectively over her baby's head\nas she stood outside a shopping center here. ``I heard they found\n400 cases of autism here.''\n","\n   There are not 400 cases of autism in this coastal town in Ocean\nCounty.
