Thirty years ago Friday.\n\n   Hundreds of millions followed anxiously on television. Three\nminutes and 10 seconds before the scheduled launch of Apollo 11, a\n30-year-old Boeing engineer named Charles Lehtinen pressed a button\nthat began the firing sequence.\n\n   At 9:32 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the monster Saturn 5 rocket,\ncarrying astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and\nMichael Collins, roared away into the heavens from Launch Pad 39A,\nleaving an 800-foot-long trail of flame.\n\n   Four days later, America's decade-long quest was realized. Man\nhad landed on the moon.\n\n   Some 13,000 Boeing employees were among the tens of thousands\nfrom NASA, McDonnell Douglas, North American, Grumman and hundreds\nof smaller companies who made it happen.\n\n   ``We were all just a bunch of kids,'' recalled John Winch, who\nwas in his late 20s when he went to work for Boeing in 1966 in\nHuntsville, Ala., as chief engineer for Saturn 5 booster\nintegration. He was responsible for making sure the first, second\nand third stages of the rocket went together and worked the way\nthey should.\n\n   ``We just did it,'' Winch said. ``We didn't know we couldn't.\n...''\n\n   In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy set the nation on a trail\nBoeing workers would eventually help to blaze.\n\n   ``I believe,'' Kennedy said, ``that this nation should commit\nitself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing\na man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.''\n\n   NASA selected Boeing that December to build the first stage of\nthe moon rocket.\n\n   Work already was under way in Huntsville on the design of a\nsuper rocket that could launch astronauts to the moon. The Saturn\n5, as it became known, was the brainchild of Wernher von Braun and\nhis team of German scientists.\n\n   ``The size of the hardware was mind boggling,'' said Denton\nHanford, 24, and just out of college when he joined Boeing in\nSeattle in 1961. A year later, he and his wife moved to Huntsville.\nHis job was to make propulsion performance predictions for the\nSaturn 5 first stage.\n\n   Doug Tilden also arrived in Huntsville, with his wife and three\nchildren, in 1962. It was his first job with Boeing. He was working\nin Houston, as a structural analysis engineer for an oil company,\nwhen he was recruited by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. He chose\nBoeing.\n\n   Tilden initially helped on a NASA project to develop the giant\ncrawler that would transport the 364-foot-tall Saturn 5 from the\nVehicle Assembly Building to its launch pad some three miles away.\nHe later worked on Saturn 5.\n\n   ``I had no idea what I was getting into,'' Tilden said. ``I was\nchallenged every day for the next 10 or 12 years. It was a great\nexperience. People were working together for a purpose, for\nsomething they believed it. It was a unique effort. I've never seen\nthat same kind of atmosphere since.''\n\n   Boeing built 15 of the first-stage booster rockets, but only the\nfirst two in Huntsville. The manufacturing operation was moved to\nthe Michoud Ordinance plant in New Orleans.\n\n   The plant, in a swamp, had not been occupied since 1945.\n\n   Hanford and other members of Boeing's first-stage team in\nHuntsville, along with about 1,500 Boeing engineers from Seattle,\nwere sent to the Michoud plant once it had been refurbished. Few\nwelcomed the forced relocation.\n\n   ``It was hot, it was humid,'' Winch said.\n\n   They prevailed, though. And the giant Saturn rocket would be\nready for its first test flight in 1967, a year that began with\ntragedy.\n\n   On the evening of Jan. 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed\nWhite and Roger Chaffee died when an electrical fire swept through\ntheir Apollo spacecraft during a launch pad test.\n\n   In the aftermath of the investigation, NASA handed Boeing a\nbigger role: Overall responsibility for Apollo and Saturn 5\nprograms.\n\n   ``We needed to have some new faces in there in order to convince\nCongress we were doing something different,'' said George Mueller,\nNASA's chief of manned spaceflight for most of the 1960s.\n\n   Mueller, who turns 81 this month, still has his sights on the\nmoon and beyond. He is chief executive officer of Kistler Aerospace\nin Kirkland, Wash., where he leads a team, many of them veterans of\nNASA, who next year plan to launch the world's first reusable\nrocket. On the wall of Mueller's office at Carillon Point, next to\na photo of a Saturn 5 being transported to the launch pad, is the\noriginal NASA schedule that Mueller, von Braun and others signed\noff on back in 1963. It charts various program milestones that had\nto be met to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade.\nThe schedule, dated Dec. 17, 1963, set the first moon landing in\nApril 1969.\n\n   Key to meeting Kennedy's challenge, Mueller said, was creating\nan organization with a can-do team spirit that could overcome any\nobstacles. On Nov. 1, 1963, Mueller ordered that instead of testing\neach stage of the Saturn 5 individually, all three stages would be\nconnected for the first flight. The ``all-up testing'' edict proved\ncrucial.\n\n   Four years later, on Nov. 9, 1967, the Saturn 5 was ready for\nthat maiden flight.\n\n   Winch was standing outside the Vehicle Assembly Building. His\nchest shook from the low frequency assault of noise. But Winch was\nabsolutely certain the rocket would work.\n\n   A second unmanned Saturn 5 test flight a few months later did\nnot go as well. Boeing's first stage developed what became known as\nthe ``pogo effect,'' a dangerous modulation that caused the booster\nto violently shake up and down for a full half minute after\nliftoff. Next, two of the five second-stage engines quit. Had this\nSaturn 5 carried astronauts, they would have had to abort the moon\nmission.\n\n   ``We spent a lot of time on pogo, trying to figure out how to\ncorrect it before the next flight,'' Tilden said. They did.\n\n   The crew of Apollo 8 orbited the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.\nApollo 9 soon followed. Then Apollo 10's lunar module came within\n50,000 feet of the moon.\n\n   The stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\n   On July 20, 1969, at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, four days\nafter the spectacular Saturn 5 liftoff from Kennedy Space Center,\nthe lunar lander Eagle with Armstrong and Aldrin, 15 seconds from\nrunning out of fuel, its on-board computer overloaded with data and\nsounding alarms, gently touched down on the Sea of Tranquility.\n\n   History held its breath.\n\n   Then came Armstrong's first words: ``Houston, Tranquility base\nhere. The Eagle has landed.''\n\n   As he watched on television those first steps on the moon,\nHanford remembered the visit that Neil Armstrong made to the\nMichoud plant a couple years earlier. Hanford had briefed and\nescorted the astronaut who would become the first man to set foot\non the moon.\n\n   Armstrong and Aldrin spent more than two hours hopping over the\nmoon's surface in bulky space suits.\n\n   Boeing engineers were then at work designing a unique vehicle\nthat could carry future astronauts across the moon miles from their\nlanding site. Three months after Apollo 11, Boeing signed a\ncontract with NASA to develop what would be called the Lunar Roving\nVehicle. Within 17 months, Boeing delivered four flight-ready\nrovers and several more for test and training.\n\n   Winch was program manager for the Boeing moon buggy team in\nHuntsville. Final assembly was in Kent. The Boeing plant south of\nSeattle had manufacturing capability that Huntsville lacked.\n\n   Tilden also worked on the project, and manned one of the mission\ncontrol consoles in Huntsville in August 1971 when Apollo 15\nastronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin spent three days exploring the\nAlpennine Mountains in the first moon buggy.\n\n   After the rover project ended, Tilden was transferred to\nSeattle. After retiring in 1994, he helped restore one of the\noriginal rover test vehicles for Boeing's Museum of Flight.\n\n   Hanford had returned to Seattle at the end of 1969, but later\nbecame general manager of Boeing's helicopter division in\nPhiladelphia. He retired last year.\n\n   Winch would spent 13 years in Seattle.\n\n   Today, all his engineering skills are being put to the test on\nthe National Missile Defense project, for which Boeing is prime\ncontractor.\n\n   But nothing can compare with the moon program, Winch said.\n\n   ``So many things we were doing for the very first time then,''\nhe said. ``We went at it with enthusiasm, with excitement, with a\nspirit of working together. You could meet with your friends, talk\nwith anyone about it. It wasn't classified. It was inspirational.\nSupply any adjective you want. That was it.''\n\n   But Hanford feels disappointment on the 30th anniversary of the\nmoon landing.\n\n   ``What struck me is how difficult it would be today to go back\nto the moon,'' he said. ``It's very disappointing that we could do\nit then, but we could not do it today. ... The commitment just\nisn't there. We could never find the motivation.''\n\n   Mueller, the ex-NASA boss for manned spaceflight, echoes him.\n\n   On July 24, 1969, the day Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific\nOcean, Mueller issued a statement that read, in part:\n\n   `` ... These trips are only the first step. There remains for\nmankind the task of deciding the next step: Will we press forward\nto explore other planets, or will we deny the opportunities of the\nfuture. ... The organization that brought men to the moon stands\nready for that next step.''\n\n   That next step never came, Mueller said Wednesday as he sat in\nhis Kirkland office looking distantly at the space photos on his\nwall.\n\n   ``To me, the most disappointing thing is that having landed on\nthe moon a few times, we essentially retreated. ... If we had\nfocused our efforts, if someone had the vision, like President\nKennedy, to say `This is what we are going to do,' we would by now\nhave a colony on Mars. We would have taken the first couple of\nsteps in the exploration of the solar system.''\n","Headline":"\nLOOKING BACK AT AN UNPARALLELED ADVENTURE, 30 YEARS AGO \n","Text":["\n   The Florida day dawned hot and humid.\n","\n   Outside Kennedy Space Center, more than a million people crowded\nroads, parks and beaches to witness the start of a great adventure,\na perilous journey of exploration unlike any other.\n","\n   July 16, 1969.
