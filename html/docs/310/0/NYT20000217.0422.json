Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The death of a patient has prompted the state to\norder Staten Island University Hospital to stop its chief of\nneurosurgery from treating other patients, five years after the\nsame doctor was fired from another hospital for operating on the\nwrong side of a patient's brain, a Health Department spokeswoman\nsaid Thursday.\n\n   In an extraordinarily strongly worded letter to the hospital's\nchief executive, the deputy health commissioner, Dennis P. Whalen,\nsaid the state had received information of a ``potentially grave\nrisk to patients.'' He said there was ``an immediate and serious\nthreat to the health of any person subjected to surgery'' performed\nby the doctor, Ehud Arbit, and directed the hospital to force him\nto stop practicing medicine there, pending the outcome of its\ninquiry.\n\n   Hospital officials would not comment Thursday night. State\nofficials would not specify the nature or extent of the\ninvestigation at the hospital. A state Health Department\nspokeswoman, Kristine Smith, said a patient, whom she would not\nidentify, died following brain surgery performed by Arbit earlier\nthis year.\n\n   In the 1995 case, at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in\nNew York, Arbit's patient survived.\n\n   Arbit did not return calls to his office about the state's new\naction. A woman who answered the phone there said, ``This all has\nnothing to do with Dr. Arbit.''\n\n   His lawyer, Barbara Ryan, said that she could not comment on the\nstate's actions. ``The cases under review are subject to patient\nconfidentiality laws,'' Ryan said. ``There are not any allegations\nyet.''\n\n   She added, ``There is no cause for concern for any of the care\nor treatment that this doctor has rendered.''\n\n   The Health Department last investigated Arbit beginning in 1995,\nwhen he was chief of neurosurgery at Memorial-Sloan Kettering. He\nmistakenly operated on the healthy right side of the brain of\nRajeswari Ayyappan, the mother of a famous Indian film star,\nSridevi Ayyappan, instead of the left side, where a cancerous tumor\nwas situated, health officials said. The error left the patient\nwith little memory and unable to recognize family members.\n\n   The Health Department rebuked the hospital and fined it $16,000,\nthe maximum amount permitted, for eight violations of regulations\non health care that it said contributed to the error. The state\ndecided that Arbit's actions warranted a one-year probation, which\nallowed him to continue practicing medicine.\n\n   It is common for doctors who have been dismissed from one\nhospital, even when they have been disciplined by the state as\nwell, to gain work at other health care centers. Even in cases\nwhere doctors lose their medical licenses, they often move to other\nstates and find work.\n\n   After the Sloan Kettering case, Arbit became the chief of\nneurosurgery at the Staten Island hospital. Contacted several times\nthis week, the hospital spokeswoman, Arleen Ryback, said she knew\nof no inquiry into Arbit or the hospital.\n\n   The state's letter to Staten Island University Hospital, dated\nTuesday, is highly unusual both in its language and its action. It\nis likely a precursor to further departmental measures against the\ndoctor and possibly the hospital. In rare cases, the department\nseeks to suspend doctors' licenses temporarily or gets them to stop\npracticing medicine while it completes its investigation, if its\nofficials believe that a doctor is a danger to patients.\n\n   In this case, state officials moved quickly as a protective\nmeasure, the department spokeswoman, Smith, said. ``We recently\nreceived credible information that would lead us to believe that\npatients undergoing surgery by Dr. Arbit face potential risk,'' she\nsaid.\n","Headline":"\nHOSPITAL IS TOLD NEUROSURGEON CAN'T OPERATE \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ The death of a patient has prompted the state to\norder Staten Island University Hospital to stop its chief of\nneurosurgery from treating other patients, five years after the\nsame doctor was fired from another hospital for operating on the\nwrong side of a patient's brain, a Health Department spokeswoman\nsaid Thursday.\n","\n   In an extraordinarily strongly worded letter to the hospital's\nchief executive, the deputy health commissioner, Dennis P.
