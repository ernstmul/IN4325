BRODY   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Just when dermatologists and cancer specialists had Americans\nconvinced that sunscreens could protect them from skin cancer and\nwrinkles, a scientist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in\nNew York concluded after a review of available research that\nsunscreens might not prevent melanoma, the deadliest form of skin\ncancer, at least not the way products were formulated and used in\nthe 1980s. This news is particularly significant given the rising\nrates of melanoma.\n\n   The scientist, Dr. Marianne Berwick, even suggested that an\noverdependence on sunscreens might actually increase the risk of\nmelanoma in susceptible people because sunscreens prevent sunburn\nwell enough to allow users to spend more time in the sun than they\notherwise might, without providing adequate protection against skin\ncancer.\n\n   The report, presented in February to the American Association\nfor the Advancement of Science, set back decades of public health\neducation and left many wondering if medical science would ever get\nit right.\n\n   But before you leap to the unwarranted conclusion that you have\nbeen duped once again by the health police, a closer look at the\neffects of sunlight on skin and the effectiveness and proper use of\nsunscreens is in order.\n\n   Ultraviolet B, or UVB, radiation is the principal cause of\nsunburn. The sun protection factor, or SPF, stated on sunscreen\nproducts refers primarily to their capacity to block UVB radiation;\nthe higher the SPF rating, the longer a user can remain in sunlight\nwithout burning.\n\n   Most sunscreen products have little or no protection against\nUltraviolet A, or UVA, the principal form of radiation emitted in\ntanning booths, which causes premature aging of the skin _ the\nwrinkled, leathery skin common among sun worshipers over 50 years\nof age. UVA radiation is also considered the primary rays involved\nin skin cancer.\n\n   While not minimizing the dangers of UVA, new research points to\nthe hazards of UVB rays. A study published in June by Dr. Ercem\nAtillasoy, a dermatologist affiliated with the Wistar Institute and\nThomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, demonstrated for the\nfirst time that UVB radiation can also cause two of the deadliest\nbut least common forms of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and\nmelanoma.\n\n   After testing the effects of UVB on human skin transplanted onto\nimmune-deficient mice, however, Atillasoy was surprised to find\nthat the most common form of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, did\nnot develop. He suspects that this cancer, which most often occurs\non the face, ears and other sun-exposed parts of the body and is\ndiagnosed in more than a million Americans each year, must be\ncaused by UVA radiation. He plans to examine this hypothesis with\nsimilar mice with transplanted human skin.\n\n   Before Atillasoy's study, there were no good animal models in\nwhich to study human melanoma, in which other factors besides\nsunlight play a role. Genetics, for example, is an important\nfactor. Fair-skinned people who do not tan easily, those with lots\nof moles and those with a family history of skin cancer are more\nlikely than dark-skinned people to develop all forms of skin\ncancer, including melanoma. And about 5 percent of melanomas occur\non the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and in the mouth and\nsinuses, areas that are not exposed to sunlight, said Dr. Allan\nHalpern, chief of dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.\n\n   ``This means that in about 95 percent of cases of melanoma, sun\nexposure plays a role, directly or indirectly,'' Halpern said.\n\n   ``The scientific data, although imperfect, are still very strong\nthat there is a link between UV and melanoma,'' he added. ``We\nstill need to work out the details _ the specific wavelengths, the\ndoses and the timing _ but there is good evidence to suggest that\nboth UVB and UVA are involved.''\n\n   Among the unknowns is the importance of sun exposure in\nchildhood. Some research suggests that severe sunburns in childhood\nset the stage for later development of melanoma. Childhood sun\nexposure may be the initiating event that plants the seeds of a\ncancer, but repeated sun exposure in adult life may be what\npromotes the full-scale growth of cancer.\n\n   Also uncertain is the effect of the intensity and frequency of\nsun exposure. People like farmers and fishermen who are always in\nthe sun get lots of basal cell carcinomas but have no greater risk\nof melanoma than others less intensely exposed to sunlight. Halpern\nsaid that repeated ``bursts'' of sunlight may be worse for\ndeveloping melanoma than continuous exposure, which would bode ill\nfor indoor workers who spend their leisure hours in the sun.\n\n   Dr. Berwick said she did not intend to discourage people from\nusing sunscreens, but rather wanted to emphasize that these\nproducts were perhaps the least important step in preventing\nmelanoma and other skin cancers. First and foremost, she and others\ninsist, is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially\nwhen it is most directly overhead _ from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in\nthe summer and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the winter. Keep in mind that\ncloud cover provides little protection against UV exposure.\n\n   Step 2 is to keep covered up when outdoors and not in the shade\nby wearing a wide-brimmed hat, long sleeves and long pants, as well\nas UV-blocking sunglasses to protect the eyes. However, few experts\nhave great hopes that Americans will heed such clothing advice when\ntemperatures rise above 80 degrees or before the problem of ``hat\nhair'' is solved.\n\n   Step 3 is to use a lip balm with an SPF rating of 15 and\nliberally apply sunscreen with an SPF rating of 15 or higher on all\nsun-exposed parts of the body every time you are outdoors. If you\nare wearing a bathing suit, use at least one ounce of sunscreen to\ncover exposed skin. Apply it at least half an hour before going out\nand reapply it every few hours, even if the product is said to be\n``water resistant'' or to provide ``all day'' protection.\n\n   Some of the newer products, called sun blocks, protect against\nUVA as well as UVB radiation. But all sun blocks are not equally\neffective. Avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789) and oxybenzone do\nnot screen out as much UVA as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Zinc\noxide, the white paste that lifeguards often use on their noses and\nlips, is the most effective sun block.\n\n   A new micronized, transparent form of zinc oxide has been\ndeveloped by Dr. Mark Mitchnick, a pediatrician who is the medical\ndirector of Sunsmart, a New York company that makes micronized zinc\noxide (sold as Z-Cote). That product has been incorporated into\nsome sun protection products, including the sunscreens Iguana, Key\nWest Aloe Sunsorb and the Body Shop SPF 30 stick and SPF 6 spray.\nIt is also in Skinceuticals' moisturizers with sunscreen, Daily Sun\nDefense and Ultimate UV Defense, and will be introduced this year\ninto the Procter & Gamble Co.'s Oil of Olay, the nation's leading\nmoisturizer with sunscreen. Zinc oxide's physical protection may be\npreferred by people sensitive to chemical sun blocks.\n\n   Â \n","Headline":"\nSUNSCREENS MAY NOT BLOCK WORST SKIN CANCERS \n","Text":["\n   Just when dermatologists and cancer specialists had Americans\nconvinced that sunscreens could protect them from skin cancer and\nwrinkles, a scientist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in\nNew York concluded after a review of available research that\nsunscreens might not prevent melanoma, the deadliest form of skin\ncancer, at least not the way products were formulated and used in\nthe 1980s.
