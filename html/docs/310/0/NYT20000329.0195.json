Times News Service    \n\n   Although electronic mail is now the preferred means of\ncommunications for many people, the telephone is still an\nindispensable tool. How else are you going to call people to find\nout if they got your e-mail?\n\n   In the hopes of finding a new cordless phone that makes me feel\nlike a teen-ager again, I've been auditioning several of them for\nmy home office: the Plantronics 900-megahertz CT10 cordless headset\ntelephone, the Siemens 2.4-gigahertz Gigaset 2420 cordless phone\nand answering system, and the 2.4-GHz BeoCom 6000 cordless phone.\nEach has a particular appeal. Each has a particular annoyance. The\ntrick is to find the one that is least annoying.\n\n   Why cordless?\n\n   Cordless phones now outsell corded phones, which shows that\npeople like to stay connected to everyone without being connected\nto anything. The newer models have many of the features of corded\nphones, like built-in answering machines, Caller ID, speakerphones,\nspeed dialing, intercoms, paging and two-line support.\n\n   But they also depend on batteries, which are finicky and require\nrecharging and special treatment. They are subject to interference\nfrom nearby electrical devices, and, at least in their traditional\nform, they are very hard to hold between one's shoulder and ear.\n\n   Unlike cellular phones, which operate on their own wireless\nnetworks, cordless phones require a nearby base station that is\nattached to a conventional phone line. The handset communicates\nwith the base station by low-power radio waves. The frequency of\nthose waves determines, at least in part, how far the handset can\nroam from the base and how clear the signal will be. The first\ngeneration of cordless phones operated at frequencies from 43 to 49\nmegahertz and were often subject to interference from fluorescent\nlights, electric toys and personal computers. They also had a\nfairly short range and signals were often blocked by walls or\nfloors.\n\n   An aside: Although the phone's range was short, the range of a\npolice scanner is long. A snoop with a scanner could listen in on a\nneighbor's cordless conversations from up to a mile away. If the\nneighbor had a baby monitor, a cordless phone set to the right\nchannel could eavesdrop on conversations taking place in the house,\neven if the occupants were not using the phone. That is why we all\nowe a debt of gratitude to the late actress Hedy Lamarr, who was a\nco-inventor of spread-spectrum technology. (Completely true, as I\nwill explain later.) But I digress.\n\n   The next generation of cordless phones moved to the less crowded\nand more secure 900-MHz spectrum and provided greater range, up to\n150 feet in a typical house, even through walls and floors.\n\n   The newest cordless phones operate at 2.4 GHz, which in theory\nprovides neighborhood-roaming range, freedom from most interference\nand the best voice quality. As pleased as I am with the 2.4-GHz\ncordless phones, I do have a nagging concern each time I hold one\nto my ear. After all, microwave ovens use the same frequency to\nboil water.\n\n   That is why I started my search with a 900-MHz headset phone,\nPlantronics CT10, which will go on sale in early May. It is a\nmarvel of miniaturization, with a pager-size keypad that clips onto\na belt or slips into a pocket, plus a lightweight headset with a\nboom microphone connected to the keypad by a thin wire.\n\n   The CT10 includes a base station that takes up only a few square\ninches of desk space. Once the system is set up _ it takes less\nthan a minute _ the user can roam around the office, house or yard\nmaking and receiving calls while using both hands for work. The\nheadset is light enough to wear all day, and the combination is the\nbest hands-free, untethered phone solution I've found.\n\n   On the negative side, the CT10 works with only a single phone\nline, which is an annoyance in two-line houses. The numbers on the\nkeypad are dinky and require nimble fingers, but then, so do the\nkeypads on a cell phone. The most serious fault is that even a\ngentle knock can separate the phone from its clip-on battery,\ncausing a lost connection or an unexpected tumble. If the tiny\nphone should accidentally fall into some nearby liquid _ a cup of\ncoffee, say, or perhaps a toilet bowl, well, let me tell you, the\nhisses, crackles and pops of a small, drowning phone are truly\npathetic.\n\n   The Plantronics CT10 will cost $129.95 when it reaches stores\nthis summer, and if I were to buy one, I would also buy the\nextended warranty plan that offers a replacement phone in case\nsomething unfortunate happens to the original.\n\n   In the form-over-function category, the BeoCom 6000, from Bang &\nOlufsen Telecom of Denmark, has the most striking design. The base\nstation is a brushed aluminum pyramid, and the handset, with its\nasymmetric but ergonomic swoop, is a brilliant and comfortable\ndesign. This is functional desk sculpture, and it is priced like\nfine art, too. The base station and one handset cost $475,\navailable only from B&O dealers, and additional handsets are $325\neach. The system can handle up to six handsets so rich people can\nscatter extra sets all over the house.\n\n   However, like other B&O audio products, the BeoCom 6000\npractically cries out to be carefully placed in isolation on an\nuncluttered desk, which immediately puts it at a disadvantage in my\noffice. The sound quality is superior, the 2.4-GHz range is\nexcellent, and it has a modest list of features, including built-in\ncaller ID, a 200-entry phone book and the ability to forward a call\nto a specific handset.\n\n   nn\n\n   Although the BeoCom 6000 is a work of art, it lacks the art of\nwork. It is a single line device, and it comes with a belt clip but\nno headset option. When properly docked with its base station, the\nCaller ID display is facing backward and downward, away from the\nuser, which means that you cannot just glance to see who is\ncalling. In short, it is not a phone for the home office, unless\nyou wear Armani suits around the house.\n\n   The best balance of style, function, features and cordless\nconvenience was the Siemens Gigaset 2420, a 2.4-GHz system. It is a\ntwo-line, corded and cordless modular phone and answering system\nthat can use as many as eight cordless handsets, which means\nbig-business phone features for a small office, home office or big\nfamily system.\n\n   The base station and one handset cost about $350; extra handsets\nare $120 or so apiece. Its many features include a digital\nanswering machine that answers each line separately, a digital\nspeakerphone, three-way conferencing, call transferring, intercom\nand a room monitoring function. If you subscribe to the phone\ncompany's extra services, the Gigaset supports Caller ID and Caller\nID on Call Waiting, as well as distinctive ringing for voice and\nfax calls. Unlike the BeoCom, the handsets work with standard\nhands-free headsets.\n\n   My two main complaints about the Siemens Gigaset are that the\nanswering system has just one voice mailbox per line, and that with\nso many features, the instruction booklet should have been less\nconfusing.\n\n   Over all, for my needs, the Siemens Gigaset 2420 answered the\ncall. Best of all, it employs frequency-hopping digital\nspread-spectrum technology, which randomly changes channels 100\ntimes a second. It is as secure from eavesdroppers as a cordless\nphone can be.\n\n   And that takes us back to Lamarr, the German beauty who died\nearlier this year at age 86. During World War II, the actress, a\nfoe of the Nazis, and the composer George Antheil conceived and\npatented frequency-hopping spread-spectrum technology as a way to\ncontrol remote-control torpedoes and protect them from radio\njamming. Today, spread-spectrum technology is the basis for many\nforms of modern communication, including secure cordless phones.    \n  \n","Headline":"\nPHONES WITH NO CORDS BUT MANY OPTIONS \n","Text":["\n   Although electronic mail is now the preferred means of\ncommunications for many people, the telephone is still an\nindispensable tool.
