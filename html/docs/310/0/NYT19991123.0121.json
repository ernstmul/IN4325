Cancer of\nthe esophagus took his father. Mack, his wife, and his daughter\nhave all survived different forms of cancer.\n\n   Above all, Mack has dedicated his political career to his\nbrother, Michael, whose final month became a long conversation\nabout the purpose of life. The talks prompted Mack to run for\nCongress, where he has recounted his brother's death from cancer at\nage 35 countless times in a crusade for more medical research\nfunding.\n\n   Mack, a Florida Republican, and many other lawmakers have\nincreasingly cited personal experiences with disease in pushing for\nnew health policies. When Congress approved another record budget\nincrease for medical research last week, the third in a row,\nadvocates said one major reason was that several key lawmakers had\nseen the effect of disease on their own families.\n\n   Funding for the National Institutes of Health will jump more\nthan 14 percent this year, far ahead of the estimated 5 percent\nraise in total discretionary spending. Following a 14.6 percent NIH\nraise last year, the boost will mean millions of additional dollars\nfor labs in New England hospitals and universities.\n\n   Research budgets are only one area where lawmakers cite their\nown health histories in crafting policy. Senator Jesse Helms, a\nNorth Carolina Republican, usually opposes any bill that tells\nprivate companies how to conduct business. But he has teamed with\nDemocratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy on a bill to require health\ninsurers to pay for colon cancer screening tests. Helms is a former\nprostate cancer patient, and his wife survived colon cancer.\n\n   Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, broke with\na large segment of the antiabortion movement to back federal\nresearch using stem cells, most often derived from human embryos.\n``As the father of a daughter with juvenile diabetes, I know\nfirsthand the devastating nature of this disease,'' Thurmond said,\nadding that stem cells hold hope for a cure.\n\n   And when advocates began pushing for a big boost for the NIH,\nthey had significant help from lawmakers _ even some of the most\nbudget-conscious Republicans _ who talk freely of what new cures\nwould mean to their own lives. Many lawmakers support doubling the\n1998 NIH budget in five years, and Congress has voted two years\nrunning to stay on track toward that goal.\n\n   There are several reasons for the broad support. Some lawmakers\nare convinced that investment in medical research helps cut\nMedicare and other health costs and boosts the economy by\ndeveloping ideas later picked up by private companies. But\nlawmakers also act out of emotion as well as reason, and nothing\ntugs on the heart like a bout with disease.\n\n   ``When someone close to you is fighting for their life, it\nforces you to learn a lot about a subject that before you did not\npay attention to,'' said Mack. ``As a result of trying to find the\nlatest information, you learn of all the different breakthroughs.\nAnd it doesn't take long to figure out that those breakthroughs\ncame because of the federal investment in research.''\n\n   As this year's research budget wound its way through Congress,\nseveral of the lawmakers involved had already made a funding boost\na personal cause.\n\n   Senator Arlen Specter, who underwent heart bypass surgery last\nyear and had a benign brain tumor removed in 1993, is chairman of\nthe Senate's health-spending subcommittee. He guided that panel to\napprove a $2 billion increase for the NIH, far more than President\nClinton requested.\n\n   ``The NIH is really the crown jewel of the federal government,''\nsaid Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania. ``It may be the only\ncrown jewel of the federal government.''\n\n   But other lawmakers wanted more. Representative John Porter,\nSpecter's counterpart in the House and a Republican from Illinois,\nsaid it would take $2.3 billion to keep the NIH budget on track to\ndouble in five years.\n\n   The higher figure was backed by Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of\nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. Stevens, a Republican from\nAlaska, had surgery for prostate cancer in 1991. The boost will\ntake the annual NIH budget to nearly $18 billion in 2000, up from\n$13.6 billion in 1998.\n\n   Other lawmakers who push for more medical funding include\nKennedy; Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who lost\na husband to colon cancer; and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, the senior\nDemocrat on Specter's health-spending subcommittee. One of six\nchildren, Harkin lost a brother recently to thyroid cancer, and\nanother brother is in the late stages of prostate cancer. Earlier,\nboth of his sisters died of breast cancer.\n\n   Those sisters had helped raised him, as Harkin's mother died\nwhen he was young and his father was in poor health. ``My sisters\nweren't poverty-stricken, but they were low-income and they didn't\nhave a lot of money to go for checkups and things like that,''\nHarkin said Monday in a phone interview from Cambridge, Mass.,\nwhere he was visiting the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical\nResearch.\n\n   Harkin recalled the funeral of his oldest sister, Mary Ann.\n``All of us were there. And I would say a year and a half after\nthat, Sylvia died of breast cancer . . . . That was incredible,\nwhen Sylvia came down with it. It was so rapid.''\n\n   Mack has been one of the most public lawmakers in talking about\ndisease in his family. At one public hearing, he called for more\ngene research in hopes that scientists would create a screening\ntest for melanoma, the cancer that took his brother Michael. More\nrecently, Mack called for better pain management, saying his\nbrother was unnecessarily denied a certain pain medication because\ndoctors feared he would become addicted to it. Mack said that\nnotion conflicts with scientific evidence.\n\n   Lawmakers say that it has also become easier to support medical\nresearch because the various groups seeking funding are battling\nwith one another less often.\n\n   For example, said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania\nRepublican, the diabetes groups ``were feuding with each other,''\nwith one pushing research, one promoting better treatment for\npeople with the disease, and one lobbying for more patient\neducation. Now they are united behind a bigger NIH budget. But\nhinting at other rivalries, Weldon said diabetes research deserves\na bigger share of NIH dollars than other diseases because new\ntreatments will have the biggest affect on overall health care\nspending.\n\n   With health research so well-regarded in Congress, advocates for\nother types of research are trying to leverage that support to\nboost their own causes. The Science Coalition, a group of 60\nuniversities, recently ran advertisements in a Capitol Hill\nnewspaper that linked the physical sciences to health. One noted\nthat MRI technology relies on physics and engineering to help\ndoctors map the body. Another highlighted the ``pharmacy on a\nchip,'' a computer device that helps doctors program the dosages of\ndozens of drugs to a patient at once.\n\n   ``Disease is nonpartisan, and it affects people personally,''\nsaid Gene Sperling, a senior economic aide to Clinton. ``That has\nclearly led to a greater commitment for long-term investment in\nresearch. It seems to have taken hold in a nonideological way.''\n","Headline":"\nISSUES OF HEALTH TURN PERSONAL DURING BUDGET DEBATE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ A week rarely goes by without Senator Connie Mack\ntelling some group about the disease that cut through his family.\nHis mother beat breast cancer but died of kidney cancer.
