He won the top bicycle race in the world\nalmost three years after a life-threatening battle with cancer.\n\n   The ``Star-Spangled Banner'' played, and the American flag was\nraised on the Champs Elysees as Armstrong, 27, became just the\nsecond American to win the Tour de France. Greg LeMond, of Wayzata,\nMinn., won three, the last in 1990.\n\n   ``I'm in shock, I'm in shock, I'm in shock,'' said Armstrong\nafter the race. ``It was a long road to get to the Tour and an even\nlonger one to get through.''\n\n   Armstrong, who rides for the US Postal Service team and was\nworld champion in 1993, has ridden the Tour three other times and\nwon two stages. But testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs,\nabdomen, and brain, interrupted his career in the fall of 1996, and\nit was uncertain _ even to him _ whether he'd return to his bike.\n\n   Sunday, after three weeks and 2,286 miles of racing in the 86th\nversion of the event, Armstrong felt he had made his point.\n\n   ``For those people who look at my case as an example, I would\njust say one thing: If you ever get a second chance in your life\nfor something, go all the way,'' he said.\n\n   The 90-mile ride from just south of Paris that finished with 10\ncircuits on the Champs Elysees was all but ceremonial for\nArmstrong, who has worn the leader's yellow jersey for the past two\nweeks and had a 7-minute 37-second lead over Swiss rider Alex\nZulle. So even when Armstrong got a flat tire on the course before\nthe pack reached Paris, he and his team just shrugged. He quickly\ngot a new wheel from the mechanics in the team car, and teammates\nKevin Livingston and Tyler Hamilton helped draft him to get back to\nthe pack.\n\n   Australian Robbie McEwen bolted over the line first in a sprint\nfinish of 3 hours 37 minutes 39 seconds. The other 140 racers were\ngiven the ``same time,'' and the race was over.\n\n   ``The last two days are kind of coming down for teams, after the\nPyrenees,'' said Livingston. ``Tonight we're going to make up for\nthat with a big party.''\n\n   No one could say for sure how many thousands of fans lined\nParis's main drag as the racers rode from the Arc de Triomphe to\nthe Place de la Concorde. But the spectators, many of them waving\nAmerican flags, stood six deep behind the barriers set up on the\nChamps Elysees on the sunny, 85-degree day.\n\n   The man in the yellow jersey, along with a yellow helmet and\nyellow racing shoes, evoked cries of ``Lance! Lance! Lance!'' every\ntime the pack whizzed past the fans.\n\n   Armstrong made more than $400,000 for the final win, plus his\nthree other stage wins, all of which will be split by the team, in\ncycling tradition. After putting a new yellow jersey over the one\nhe already was wearing and raising his hands in victory, Armstrong\nbounded from the podium to climb into the stands and kiss his wife,\nKristin, and mother, Linda.\n\n   Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., was the top American to finish\nbehind Armstrong, almost 27 minutes back.\n\n   It was the first Tour since 1926 in which the French didn't win\na stage in their own race. They got some consolation, though, when\nFrenchman Richard Virenque was awarded the polka-dot jersey for the\nfifth time for winning the most climbing points. German Erik Zabel\nwon the green jersey as the best sprinter.\n\n   Armstrong will set off for some criterium races in Holland and\nBelgium Monday and Tuesday. Then he'll fly to New York Wednesday\nfor TV appearances; have lunch with filmmaker Bud Greenspan, who\nwants to make a movie of Armstrong's life; and meet with people\nfrom Putnam Publishing, which has paid $400,000 for the rights to\nhis autobiography.\n\n   He probably won't get back home to Austin, Texas, until Aug. 10,\nwhen he will be welcomed with a parade.\n\n   Three years ago, before he was diagnosed with cancer, Armstrong\ndidn't make it to Paris, dropping out of the Tour after the first\nweek. Last year he was here as a TV commentator.\n\n   So this year, after a break from his bike because of cancer that\nresulted in chemotherapy, brain surgery, and his French team\ndropping him, Armstrong was back with a new team and a new goal.\nNot to win the Tour, necessarily, but to get back to racing at his\npre-cancer level.\n\n   When he won the prologue time trial three weeks ago and was\ngiven the yellow jersey, he said he had surprised even himself.\n\n   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``It was oddly\nemotional, because the yellow jersey wasn't a big dream of mine in\nmy career. But to put it on, it just hit me. To do it on that\nstage, to represent what I've been through, was fantastic.''\n\n   That first week, the jersey was passed around from Jann Kirsipuu\nto Tom Steels to Mario Cipolini as sprinters won the flat stages.\nArmstrong stayed close to the lead in the standings, and he was\nhelped by more than just good riding. An accident on a wet road in\nthe second stage involved almost three dozen riders and put them\nback by six minutes . . . minutes that would be hard to get back in\nthe mountain stages.\n\n   LeMond, who won the Tour de France in 1986, '89, and '90 and\nspent 10 days here watching the race and riding some of it while\nleading a tour group, said the drama of this year's Tour was more\noutside the race than in it.\n\n   ``It's exciting that Lance has come back, but it's not a very\nexciting race,'' he said, pointing out that the top competitors\nweren't here.\n\n   All four previous Tour winners, in fact, weren't involved.\nSpaniard Miguel Indurain, who won in 1995, has retired. Bjarne\nRiis, the '96 winner, broke his arm at the Tour of Switzerland in\nJune, and '97 winner Jan Ullrich is sidelined with a broken leg.\nLast year's winner, Italian Marco Pantani, said when the course was\nannounced last fall that it was not mountainous enough for him.\nCoincidentally or not, Pantani was ejected from last month's Tour\nof Italy, which he was leading, for testing positive for EPO.\n\n   A rider also expected to make a run at the yellow jersey was\nZulle. But he was involved in that crash in the second stage, and\nhe never could make up the deficit. If Armstrong held his own in\nthe mountains, he was guaranteed to stay in front of Zulle _ and he\ndid.\n\n   ``It was Armstrong's tactics and Zulle's non-tactics that made\nthe difference,'' LeMond said. ``Lance took advantage of it.''\n\n   The competition was further thinned when Bobby Julich of\nPhiladelphia dropped out after he crashed in the time trial at the\nbeginning of the second week and suffered broken ribs. He finished\nthird in last year's race and was 20th overall before he quit.\n\n   That was the time trial that Armstrong won to vault him into the\nlead. He would put on the yellow jersey and hang onto it through\nthe Pyrenees and the Alps and into Paris.\n\n   If anything affected him, it was the way some of the French\npress wrote about his exceptional racing, accusing him of using\nperformance-enhancing drugs.\n\n   Armstrong said he won't feel like the race was marred, though.\n\n   ``All the innuendo and speculation which has gone on is minor,''\nhe said. ``This is going to give hope and inspiration to millions\nof people.

I had people who believed in me, and I\nfinish a happy man.''\n","Headline":"\nARMSTRONG'S CYCLE IS COMPLETE \n","Text":["\n   PARIS _ American Lance Armstrong Sunday triumphantly completed\nan improbable journey.
