The animal can activate the\nneurons, he said, ``just by thinking about movement.''\n\n   But using brain signals to control a device may lead brain\nactivity to change in response, which would make it harder to\ndevelop a system for human prostheses. ``Once you've gone into the\nsystem and changed the rules, it's not clear it's going to function\nin the same way,'' Wolpaw said. ``It's a big unknown.''\n\n   In studies of amputees, researchers have found that the brain\nreconfigures itself once sensory input is shut off or changed.\nOften neurons that used to control one limb will rewire themselves\nto control other parts of the body, which leads to the phenomenon\nknown as phantom limbs.\n\n   Nicolelis hopes to address this issue, in part, by building in a\nfeedback mechanism that will introduce a dialogue between the brain\nand the limb.
