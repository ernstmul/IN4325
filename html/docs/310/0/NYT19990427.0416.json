Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ A scientist suspected of spying for China\nimproperly transferred huge amounts of secret data from a computer\nsystem at a government laboratory, compromising virtually every\nnuclear weapon in the United States arsenal, government and lab\nofficials say.\n\n   The data _ millions of lines of computer code that approximate\nhow this country's atomic warheads work _ were downloaded from a\ncomputer system at the Los Alamos, N.M., weapons lab that is open\nonly to those with top-level security clearances, according to the\nofficials.\n\n   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, then transferred the files to a\nwidely accessible computer network at the lab, where they were\nstored under other file names, the officials said.\n\n   The Taiwan-born scientist transferred most of the secret data in\n1994 and 1995, officials said.\n\n   American experts said the data would be useful to any nuclear\npower trying to replicate this country's atomic designs. But one\nAmerican scientist said the codes and accompanying data were not,\nby themselves, sufficient to produce an exact copy of an American\nweapon.\n\n   American officials said there was evidence that the files were\naccessed by someone after they were placed in the unclassified\nnetwork. Other evidence suggests that this was done by a person who\nimproperly used a password, the officials said.\n\n   The investigation is continuing, and officials do not know\nwhether the data transferred by Lee was obtained by another\ncountry.\n\n   In 1996, Lee became the focus of an FBI investigation into a\nseparate case, what American official believe was China's theft\nfrom Los Alamos of design data for America's most advanced warhead,\nthe W-88. That theft apparently took place in the 1980s. China has\ndenied stealing the material.\n\n   Now officials fear that a much broader array of nuclear test\ndata may have been moved to Beijing in the 1990s. Lee has not been\ncharged with any crime.\n\n   Federal investigators did not discover the evidence of huge file\ntransfers until last month, when they examined Lee's office\ncomputer in connection with their investigation of the earlier\ntheft at Los Alamos, a sprawling lab complex about 35 miles outside\nSanta Fe.\n\n   They then found evidence that Lee, who held one of the\ngovernment's highest security clearances, had been transferring\nenormous files involving millions of lines of secret computer code,\nofficials said.\n\n   Although Lee had been under investigation in the W-88 case for\nnearly three years, Los Alamos officials failed to monitor his\ncomputer use and let him retain his access to nuclear secrets until\nlate 1998.\n\n   Lee was fired by the Energy Department for security violations\non March 8. His attorney, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles, did not\nreturn a telephone call. In the past, Holscher has denied any\nwrongdoing by his client.\n\n   President Clinton was first told of the new evidence by Energy\nSecretary Bill Richardson on March 31. During a subsequent meeting\nat the White House residence in early April, the president told\nRichardson to ``get to the bottom of it,'' Richardson recalled in\nan interview Tuesday.\n\n   Earlier in March, before being briefed by Richardson, the\npresident said he had not been told of any evidence of espionage\nduring his administration.\n\n   In response to the new evidence and with the president's\nsupport, Richardson shut down the classified computer systems at\nLos Alamos and two other major nuclear weapons laboratories this\nmonth. He ordered changes in the computer security procedures to\nmake it more difficult to move nuclear secrets out of the\nclassified networks.\n\n   ``These Wen Ho Lee transgressions cannot occur any more,''\nRichardson said in the interview.\n\n   Congressional leaders were told of the new evidence in\nclassified briefings last week.\n\n   The huge scale of the security breach has shocked some\nofficials, and has prompted a new sense of urgency in the FBI to\nsolve the Los Alamos spy case. The bureau is now pouring additional\nagents and resources into the investigation. The evidence of\ntransfers from his office computer provided the basis for an FBI\nsearch of Lee's home on April 10, officials said. Lee is believed\nto be still living in Los Alamos.\n\n   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Select Committee on\nIntelligence, said in an interview that the briefings on the new\nevidence ``confirmed my worst fears that China's espionage is\nongoing, it's deep and we can't wish it away.''\n\n   There were varying assessments of the gravity of the security\nbreach. One official familiar with the new evidence said, ``This is\nmuch, much, much worse than the W-88 case.''\n\n   But an Energy Department official said that because it remained\nunclear whether China actually obtained the data, the case at this\npoint ``is serious but not of the scope of the W-88.''\n\n   The fact that the huge data transfers were not detected until\nthe last few weeks has sparked outrage among officials who wonder\nwhy computer use by a scientist already under suspicion as a spy\nwas not being closely watched by Los Alamos or the FBI.\n\n   An internal investigation at the Energy Department into why Lee\nretained access to American nuclear secrets while he was a spy\nsuspect was begun a month ago and is nearing completion. It is\nlikely to prompt disciplinary action against some lab and Energy\nDepartment officials, according to a senior Energy Department\nofficial.\n\n   FBI officials have told Congress that Lee and his wife, Sylvia,\nhad prior relationships with the bureau. In the early 1980s, Lee\nvolunteered information to the bureau, but officials would not\nprovide details. Mrs. Lee provided the bureau with information on\nforeign visitors to Los Alamos from about 1987 to 1992, but her\ninformation was not considered valuable.\n\n   Until now, Clinton and his aides have portrayed Chinese nuclear\nespionage as a problem that occurred during previous\nadministrations. Amid the furor over the administration's handling\nof the earlier theft of the W-88 data from Los Alamos, the White\nHouse has stressed that the espionage occurred in the 1980s, long\nbefore Clinton took office.\n\n   But the new evidence raises the stakes of the congressional\ninvestigations now under way into how the Los Alamos case was\nhandled after the W-88 theft was first detected in 1995.\n\n   nn\n\n   The information improperly transferred by Lee included what Los\nAlamos officials call the ``legacy'' codes. According to John\nBrowne, director of Los Alamos, the legacy codes consist of\ncomputer data used to design nuclear weapons, analyze nuclear test\nresults and evaluate weapons materials and the safety\ncharacteristics of America's nuclear warheads.\n\n   ``They are codes that integrate our best understanding of the\nprocesses that go on in a nuclear weapon,'' Browne said in an\ninterview.\n\n   The legacy codes can be used to help design nuclear weapons\nthrough computer simulation, and so are valuable on their own. But\nthey become more valuable when combined with specific performance\ndata, which would then enable someone to generate a computer\nsimulation of American warhead designs.\n\n   Officials said Lee transferred both the legacy codes and the\ninput data for specific U.S. warheads that go with the legacy\ncodes. The codes and performance data provide what a Los Alamos\nscientist described as a ``rough approximation'' of the physical\nprocesses that occur in a nuclear weapon.\n\n   Ray E. Kidder, a nuclear-weapons physicist at the Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory in California, said the combined data\nwas equivalent to a scientific blueprint.\n\n   ``If you've got the source code and the input data, you can\nreverse-engineer the thing and have a complete plan for nuclear\nexplosive part of the weapon,'' Kidder said.\n\n   One lab official said investigators were still trying to\ndetermine the extent of the security breach and exactly how many\nwarheads were involved in the data transfers.\n\n   The legacy codes and the warhead data that goes with them could\nbe particularly valuable for a country, like China, that has signed\nonto the nuclear test ban treaty and relies solely on computer\nsimulations to upgrade and maintain its nuclear arsenal. The legacy\ncodes are now used to maintain the American nuclear arsenal through\ncomputer simulation.\n\n   Most of Lee's transfers occurred in 1994 and 1995, just before\nChina signed the test ban treaty in 1996, according to American\nofficials.\n\n   But officials say Lee may have started transferring files out of\nthe classified computer network as early as 1983. So far, officials\nhave not found evidence of transfers after 1995.\n\n   Lee, 59, began working at Los Alamos in 1978. His wife worked as\na secretary at the lab.\n\n   Lee also traveled to China on several occasions while working at\nLos Alamos. In June 1986 he delivered a paper on nuclear-weapons\nrelated science at a symposium in Beijing with the approval of Los\nAlamos officials. In June 1988 he delivered another paper at a\nconference in Beijing, again with the lab's approval.\n\n   In 1995 U.S. intelligence officials began to suspect that China\nhad obtained design data from the W-88 warhead. In 1996 the FBI\nbegan a criminal investigation of the W-88 theft, and Lee emerged\nas the principal suspect.\n\n   Yet by 1997 the bureau's investigation was stalled. The\nDepartment of Justice declined an FBI request to seek court\napproval to gain surreptitious access to Lee's office computer,\nofficials said. Once the the request was rejected, officials of the\nbureau and the Energy Department determined that they needed Lee's\napproval to examine his office computer.\n\n   In April 1997 Lee was transferred to a new job at Los Alamos,\nwhere he was responsible for updating legacy codes for five\nAmerican warheads. Although Los Alamos officials knew he was\nalready under investigation in the W-88 theft, they believed that\nhis continued access to the legacy codes would not be damaging\nbecause they knew he had had access to them for years, lab and\nEnergy Department officials said. But Los Alamos officials also\nassured the Energy Department that there were fire walls in place\nto prevent the leakage of classified information, they added.\n\n   It was not until last month, just a few days before he was\nfired, that the FBI finally asked for and received Lee's\nauthorization to search his computer, officials said. Once the\nbureau saw the transferred files in the unclassified computer\nnetwork, investigators realized their significance.\n\n   Within days, Richardson was briefed, and he then told the\npresident and shut down the lab's computer systems for two weeks.\nBut the FBI still encountered delays in winning Justice Department\napproval to seek a court-ordered search of Lee's home, officials\nsaid, and did not conduct the search until April 10.\n\n   The FBI has told Congress that it believes that the new\ninformation of computer transfers is the strongest evidence they\nhave against Lee, officials said. The New York Times delayed\npublication of this article for one day at the request of the FBI,\nwhich said the latest disclosure could impede its inquiry.\n","Headline":"\nSUSPECT IN CHINA SPY CASE REPORTEDLY GOT SECRET BOMB CODE DATA\n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ A scientist suspected of spying for China\nimproperly transferred huge amounts of secret data from a computer\nsystem at a government laboratory, compromising virtually every\nnuclear weapon in the United States arsenal, government and lab\nofficials say.\n","\n   The data _ millions of lines of computer code that approximate\nhow this country's atomic warheads work _ were downloaded from a\ncomputer system at the Los Alamos, N.M., weapons lab that is open\nonly to those with top-level security clearances, according to the\nofficials.\n","\n   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, then transferred the files to a\nwidely accessible computer network at the lab, where they were\nstored under other file names, the officials said.\n","\n   The Taiwan-born scientist transferred most of the secret data in\n1994 and 1995, officials said.\n","\n   American experts said the data would be useful to any nuclear\npower trying to replicate this country's atomic designs.
