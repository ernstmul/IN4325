They\nthink they know how to stop the bombings and ease ethnic tensions\nthere: they meditate.\n\n   And they are linked by the Internet with a group of about 90\nSerbians in Belgrade trying the same approach.\n\n   In much the same way that radio waves transmit sound over long\ndistances, they say their brain waves can radiate a form of energy\nthat is unusually calm and coherent, and helps dissolve the\nstresses that cause war.\n\n   ``We're undermining warlike tendencies,'' without the aggressors\neven knowing it, said Laure Edwards, 43, a financial writer from\nNatick who is an advanced meditator.\n\n   No one in the Watertown group has personal friends or family\nmembers in war-torn Yugoslavia. But they have seen graphic film\nfootage of refugees streaming out of Kosovo, the world they knew\nleft behind them in shreds. And they have read touching e-mail\nmessages from Dragana Pejcic, a 38-year-old graduate student in\nBelgrade who communicates with them through the Internet.\n\n   ``Everyone is tired and exhausted from the daily air-raid\nsirens, from going to the cellars and shelters during the night,\nfrom listening to all kinds of (emotional) stories,'' Pejcic wrote.\n``Monday, around 4 a.m., I woke up because the building was shaking\nas if an earthquake hit us. . . . After that, we watched fire\neverywhere. Terrible!''\n\n   Duncan Brown, 42, a computer network administrator, explained\nthe urgent concern that has brought the meditators to his home.\n\n   ``It's impossible to go on with our normal lives knowing that\nthis is happening,'' he said. ``I'm upset by the suffering and\ncruelty I see in Kosovo. The world is my family.''\n\n   Cindy Kuhn, 49, a documentary archivist living in Pepperell,\nsaid she was especially moved by stories of Serbian meditators\ntraveling across Belgrade, ``while bombs are coming down, to get to\na place where they can create a little island of peace.''\n\n   Wrote Pejcic, ``We meet in the home of Milija and Marija\nPetrovic, (meditating) there during the day and sleeping in our own\nhomes at night. To get there, those who live on the other side of\nthe river Sava, in Belgrade's center, have to cross the bridge. And\nbecause two bridges already have been bombed, with the threat of\nfurther bombing increasing, many people hardly dare to come. . . .\n\n   ``It is very painful to understand what's going on. We just know\nwhat a solution is. And we work on that.''\n\n   By meditating together, in Watertown as in Belgrade, the group\nmembers say they are creating a more settled, restful environment\nthat is more conducive to rational decision-making.\n\n   For Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic or NATO leaders to\nreally get the message, these meditators probably would need a much\nlarger group, they say. But perhaps they can help at least a few\npeople to shift their thinking.\n\n   ``The killing in Kosovo is because of all the differences people\nsee. A better answer is to help people see the commonalities, the\nunity,'' said Peggy Gurnan, 54, who teaches mathematics at a middle\nschool in Lowell.\n\n   ``This isn't something intellectual or abstract,'' she said.\n``It's a direct experience of connectedness.''\n\n   These peacemakers practice an advanced form of Transcendental\nMeditation. They say the technique allows their minds to settle\ndown so that they contact a field of natural energy and\nintelligence, which they say some physicists call the unified field\nof consciousness.\n\n   Refining and softening this field in one place, they say, can\nhave a long-range ameliorating effect somewhere else. And doing it\ntogether makes the effect more powerful.\n\n   They know some observers will think their ideas absurd. But\nhistory, they say, supports their claims.\n\n   Carla Brown, who wrote a Harvard dissertation on the subject,\nsaid 43 studies have documented a link between this form of\nmeditation and reductions in conflict and negativity, including a\nfamous study of warfare in Lebanon published by Yale's Journal of\nConflict Resolution.\n\n   ``Scientists who reviewed the work decided they had to publish\nit,'' she said. ``They didn't believe it, but they couldn't deny\nit.''\n\n   In her dissertation, Brown documented how most scientific\nbreakthroughs have been initially greeted by ridicule.
