Clench your jaw, and a program starts up.\n\n   Focus hard enough, and the screen comes alive in an electronic\nlight show concerto, the various notes and corresponding colors\ncontrolled by your thoughts.\n\n   It sounds like science fiction, but Cyberlink, as it's called,\nis here, and it was wowing crowds at the South By Southwest\nInteractive Conference, part of a technology, music and film\nfestival in Austin that closes Sunday.\n\n   ``It's almost scary, watching the computer do things you're\nthinking about,'' said David Martin, an electronic musician from\nNew York who stepped away from the demo booth, sweating. ``Very\nscience fiction.''\n\n   Cyberlink was pioneered by Andrew Junker, a researcher at the\nWright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Junker was part\nof a program to create links between a pilot and the instruments of\nan aircraft, the better to deal with information overload while\nhunting down enemy jets and dodging surface-to-air missiles.\n\n   Before Cyberlink, hands-free computer control involved\ncoordinating a command to an eye, head or facial movement.\n\n   Junker, while retired and living in the Caribbean, said he\ninvented a way of harnessing a range of brain waves, muscle\ncontractions and eye movements. These impulses are captured by\nthree silver chloride-coated plastic tablets held to the head with\na Velcro strap.\n\n   The strap is connected to a small box of electronics _ including\na microprocessor and amplifiers _ that boost and filter brain\nwaves, muscle and eye impulses into a recognizable signal fed into\na Windows-based computer through its serial port.\n\n   ``The battle was over how to convert all this information into\nsomething usable,'' said Chris Tate, 37, a biomedical engineer and\ndirector of research at Brain Actuated Technologies Inc., the\nYellow Springs, Ohio-based company Junker formed to find practical\nuses for his invention.\n\n   The device doesn't actually read thoughts. It associates certain\nfacial muscle movements and/or brain waves with a certain computer\nfunction. Users can repeat the function by repeating the movement\nor brain wave.\n\n   For example, when a user thinks, ``move cursor up,'' he\ngenerates a unique combination of eye, muscle and brain waves for\nthat thought. The software is trained to move the cursor up when\nthe signal for that combination of reflexes is sent to the\ncomputer.\n\n   ``I couldn't tell you what I do to make the computer do certain\nthings,'' Tate said. ``If you consciously try to make it happen,\nyou exaggerate and throw everything off. You just have to accept\nthat you do generate this signal and tell the computer to take a\ncertain action based on the signal. It's very, very Zen.''\n\n   According to Tate, the software can be trained to perform any\nnumber of tasks, depending on a user's ability to generate a\nspecific signal for that task. He added that an interface to type\nis being developed.\n\n   The Cyberlink technology also drives Brain Actuated\nTechnologies' new Brain-Actuated Music software, which translates\nthe headband signal into musical notes. Again, certain brain waves\nand corresponding muscle and eye movements trigger a synthesized\nchorus of high notes or deep bass. Tate already is compiling a\ncatalog of original works, starting with the ``Cortex Concerto.''\n\n   Tate said the company is searching for investors, but it has yet\nto find what he called the right deal.\n\n   More than 200 Cyberlinks are being field-tested as a computing\naid for disabled people who cannot use their hands to manipulate a\nmouse and keyboard, Tate said.\n\n   The device costs $1,900.\n","Headline":"\nDEVICE PROVIDES COMPUTER SKILLS AT THE BLINK OF AN EYE \n","Text":["\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ Finally, it's mind over computer.\n","\n   Concentrate, and a cursor on a computer screen drifts toward a\nfile you want to open.
