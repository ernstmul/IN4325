BRODY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Ten years ago I wrote a column that might have been called ``the\nmyth of the negative mammogram.'' In it I discussed the fact that\n10 percent to 15 percent of breast cancers do not show up on a\nmammogram and cautioned women that any suspicious area in the\nbreast should be biopsied even when the mammogram is negative.\n\n   Last month, I became living proof of the value of that advice.\nI'd been having annual mammograms for about 13 years with no\nevidence of anything wrong. Likewise at my exam this year, my\nradiologist for the last eight years, Dr. Doreen Liebeskind,\ndelivered the news that my X-rays looked fine. However, this time I\nfeared something was the matter.\n\n   The matter was an area of thickening in my left breast that we'd\nbeen watching for years. My mammograms were consistently negative\nand sonograms had shown nothing more than fibrous tissue, a normal\naberration common in many women. But from time to time the area\nhurt and it had been especially painful two weeks earlier.\n\n   I had begun to wonder how I would know if something went awry.\nEven if I suspected all was not well, would I fail to act after\nbeing reassured for seven years that there was nothing to worry\nabout?\n\n   Then Dr. Liebeskind did a manual exam and said, ``It feels a\nlittle different from last year, a little more nodular. Let's get\nanother sonogram.'' Sonography, a way of viewing tissue using\nultra-high-speed sound waves, is an excellent noninvasive tool for\ninvestigating suspicious areas in the breast that are picked up\neither by a mammogram or physical examination.\n\n   It is also useful for screening women at high risk either\nbecause of family or personal histories of breast cancer, according\nto Dr. Peter I. Pressman, breast cancer surgeon at Lenox Hill\nHospital and Beth Israel Medical Center and co-author, with Dr.\nYashar Hirshaut, of ``Breast Cancer: The Complete Guide'' (Bantam\nrevised edition, $14.95).\n\n   When Dr. Liebeskind compared my sonogram to the one taken last\nyear, she said, ``There's something new there now, and I think we\nshould do a needle biopsy and see what it is.'' Guided by\nultrasound, a thin hollow needle was inserted into the suspicious\narea and cells were sucked out for microscopic analysis.\n\n   It was all so swift and matter-of-fact that I wasn't even scared\nwhen Dr. Liebeskind said she saw something in the cells that wasn't\nquite normal. She handed over the slides of my breast cells to Dr.\nGrace Yang, cytopathologist at New York University Medical Center.\n\n   Several years ago, Dr. Yang developed a rapid stain technique\nthat enabled her to make a diagnosis within 10 minutes _ no three\ndays of agonized waiting for biopsy results. I don't know why her\ntechnique is not used everywhere by now.\n\n   Dr. Yang was also matter-of-fact. ``This is cancer,'' she said,\ntempering her grim report with, ``But you're very lucky. It's\nsmall, one centimeter, and very early and of low nuclear grade,\nmeaning it's not an aggressive cancer.'' Surgery a week later and a\ncomplete microscopic analysis of the tumor and lymph nodes into\nwhich my breast drains confirmed her diagnosis.\n\n   I was very lucky, if someone with cancer could ever be\nconsidered lucky. My chances are better than 95 percent that the\nsurgery, a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy, and subsequent five\nweeks of radiation (five days a week) will be a permanent cure.\n\n   In a lumpectomy, the surgeon removes the tumor and a small\namount of surrounding tissue, and the sentinel node biopsy removes\nonly those underarm nodes into which the breast drains. And just to\nbe sure, since my tumor cells, like those of most breast cancers,\nrespond to estrogen, I'll be taking the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen\nfor the next five years.\n\n   Just last year, a major multicenter study showed that tamoxifen\nreduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence and the chances of\ndeveloping cancer in the opposite breast by about 45 percent.  \n\n   My experience should in no way discourage any woman from having\nregular mammograms. My advice is also the recommendation of the\nAmerican Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute: an\nannual mammogram starting at age 40. Mammography is an excellent\nsurveillance tool that can detect 85 percent of breast cancers. It\ncan pick up tumors when they are too tiny to be felt, before they\nhave spread beyond the area where they arose, when the potential\nfor cure is greatest.\n\n     \nnn\n\n   Early detection through mammography is one of the main reasons\nfor the declining death rate from breast cancer. The other factors\nare the widespread use of radiation therapy for five or six weeks\nfollowing a lumpectomy and postoperative chemotherapy, which,\ndepending on the cellular nature of the tumor, is now often given\neven when there is no evidence that cancer has spread beyond the\nbreast if the tumor is larger than mine or there are indications\nthat it is more aggressive.\n\n   Mammograms are lifesaving, and I will continue to have them\nannually. But as with the recently removed tumor, I will not rely\non them 100 percent. If something feels wrong, I will make sure to\nhave it examined by ultrasound and biopsied if there is a\nsuspicious lesion.\n\n   I will repeat what Dr. Liebeskind told me in 1988: ``Every lump\nshould be biopsied unless it disappears on its own in a month or\ntwo or it is shown to be a benign fluid-filled cyst that collapses\nand does not recur when the fluid is removed.''\n\n   A mammogram alone cannot distinguish between an innocent cyst\nand a cancer. If ultrasound is available, it can show if the cyst\nis filled with fluid, and guided by ultrasound, a needle can be\nused to suck out the fluid.\n\n   Despite the value of mammography, a negative mammogram does not\nrule out cancer. Mammograms are most likely to miss cancers in\nwomen under 50 who have dense breast tissue. Breast size, however,\nis not a factor.\n\n   Although annual mammography is not recommended before age 40\n(except, perhaps, for women with a strong family history of early\nbreast cancer or who carry genes that place them at high risk of\ncancer), many radiologists recommend that a baseline mammogram be\ndone at age 30 or 35, when everything is likely to be normal. That\nway future deviations from normal will be easier to spot.\n\n   Too many women with worrisome lumps are falsely reassured by\ndoctors when their mammograms are negative. Some are advised to\nreturn in three or six months for another look, but others are not\nexamined again for another year.\n\n   One of my friends who had a mammogram-negative lump was followed\nfor a year with periodic mammograms before her doctor decided to do\na biopsy, which revealed a cancer.\n\n   Money should not be a concern that deters women from having\nregular mammograms. Many states now have laws mandating insurance\ncoverage, at least for women over 50, and Medicare now covers\nannual mammography for all Medicare-eligible women.\n\n   For those not fully covered by insurance, there are low-cost\nmammography services almost everywhere. To find one, call the\nAmerican Cancer Society at (800) 227-2345.\n\n   And don't forget breast self-examination. Even with the\nincreased use of screening mammography, today most women with\nbreast cancer come to the doctor with a tumor they have found\nthemselves, usually by accident.\n\n   This speaks to the value of doing regular breast\nself-examination because a woman who checks her own breasts every\nmonth is most likely to be sensitive to subtle changes that could\nmean trouble. And the earlier trouble is discovered, the less\naggressive the therapy needs to be and the greater the likelihood\nof cure.\n\n   As Dr. Liebeskind put it, ``A woman doesn't have to know what\nshe is feeling, only that it feels different from before.'' She\nemphasizes that monthly examinations by a woman who is familiar\nwith every nuance in her breasts are far more likely to pick up an\nearly cancer than is a annual breast examination by a health\nprofessional.\n","Headline":"\nFIRSTHAND PROOF OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAST BIOPSIES \n","Text":["\n   Ten years ago I wrote a column that might have been called ``the\nmyth of the negative mammogram.''
