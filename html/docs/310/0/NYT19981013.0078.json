Surgery for Lafnitzegger had been scheduled for\nyesterday, but the operation was canceled when Group Health\nofficials said they would not pay the $100,000 cost.\n\n   ``The drug they use is not FDA-approved . . . and there's not\nmuch published literature on this,'' said Dr. Hugh Straley, an\nadministrator and oncologist at Group Health in Seattle.\n\n   Friedman truly believes he has the best approach to treating\nglioblastomas, Straley said, but the opinion of one doctor or even\none medical center isn't proof enough. Lafnitzegger can appeal the\ndecision, he said, and because of the medical urgency that appeal\nwill be expedited.\n\n   ``We can do it in a matter of days,'' Straley said.\n\n   The broader question, he said, has to do with who should pay for\nunproven therapies.\n\n   For Lafnitzegger, the answer is simple. ``It's the only chance I\nhave,'' she said. ``Even if all they can do is help me live another\nyear, that's reason enough.''\n\n   Lafnitzegger, who with her husband, Eric, has two boys, ages 4\nand 6, has perhaps the most aggressive and deadliest of brain\ntumors, known as glioblastoma multiforme. She's had brain surgery\nto remove some of the tumor and external beam radiation therapy,\nbut the cancer persists.\n\n   When it appeared that there was little more to be done for her\nat Group Health, she and her doctor began exploring the unique\nneurosurgical procedure at Duke.\n\n   Lafnitzegger said her physician at Group Health Cooperative in\nTacoma ordered the tests required by Duke's Comprehensive Cancer\nCenter and her oncologist agreed to refer her.\n\n   ``They said they had to cancel the surgery because Group Health\nwas refusing to pay,'' Lafnitzegger said. She was stunned, scared\nand angry. The cooperative called Duke to cancel the surgery but\ndidn't call her, she said.\n\n   Straley said Lafnitzegger was not referred to Duke. Her\nphysician only agreed to explore this option, Straley said, which\nwas somehow misconstrued by Duke as a referral and authorization\nfor treatment.\n\n   ``It's one of many investigational therapies,'' he said. It\nwould be irresponsible for Group Health to authorize coverage for\nan unproven treatment based on one patient's or one doctor's\nassessment, he said. Straley said standard procedure calls for\nchemotherapy following surgery and radiation therapy.\n\n   But he admits that survival rates for patients who receive\nstandard care is terrible. ``Most patients die of this in 18\nmonths.''\n\n   Friedman said Group Health's refusal is a knee-jerk response\ninsurers use when asked to pay for any new therapy.\n\n   ``The longer they stall, the more likely it is she won't be a\ncandidate,'' he said. ``The clock favors the insurance company. . .\n. She may not have weeks . . . They know that.''\n\n   Friedman thinks he can give Lafnitzegger more time, perhaps a\nlot more.\n\n   The North Carolina cancer specialists employ a new twist on a\nstandard approach to treating this form of brain tumor using\nradioactive antibodies to target and kill cancer cells. It's\ninvestigational, Friedman acknowledged, but patients are already\nsurviving much longer than expected.\n\n   ``Our patients appear to be beating the odds,'' Friedman said.\nOne of his first patients was given a year to live _ nearly five\nyears ago.\n\n   ``It will be five years on Dec. 9,'' said Susan Feinglos,\ndirector of the medical library at Duke. She had a relatively large\ntumor in her right frontal lobe and was told by her physician\nhusband not to read the medical literature on glioblastoma.\n\n   ``No one lived,'' Feinglos said. ``It was pretty gloomy.''\n\n   She won't claim to be cured, but Feinglos has so far shown no\nsigns of recurrent cancer. Not all of the patients at Duke do so\nwell. Many die anyway, but Friedman contended it's worth the\nestimated $100,000 even if all they can do is give someone like\nLafnitzegger a year or two longer.\n\n   ``I want to see my youngest son enter kindergarten,''\nLafnitzegger said.\n\n   The Duke therapy is an improvement on standard therapy, Friedman\nsaid, but he contended it doesn't increase the cost of treating\nglioblastoma because they don't charge for the experimental\nantibody.\n\n   In the procedure, surgeons go in and remove as much of the tumor\nas possible. Into the surgically created ``crater'' in the brain,\ndoctors place a tube. After the crater is tested for leaks using\ntracer isotopes, a chamber containing a cancer-killing liquid\niodine solution is connected to the tube.\n\n   The liquid contains monoclonal antibodies that have been\nmanufactured to target specific tumor proteins and that carry\nradioactive iodine-131.\n\n   ``We use liquid iodine because we figured we'd get a more\nhomogeneous distribution and less radiation damage to healthy\ntissue,'' Friedman said.\n\n   In a study published last June in the Journal of Clinical\nOncology, the Duke team, led by Dr. Darell Bigner, reported on the\nincreased survival time among patients with glioblastoma treated in\nthis fashion.\n\n   Friedman, who works with Bigner, noted that many private\ninsurers helped pay for the patients in that study.
