NOBLE   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   ``On a scale from 1 to 10, how much pain are you in?'' a\nlaboratory technician asks Bernard Kingsley.\n\n   Kingsley is lying, cramped, inside a huge magnet, in a space\nnarrow and claustrophobic enough to panic even the brave. A padded\ncradle, an antenna wrapped around it, envelops his head.\n\n   ``Six,'' he replies.\n\n   Increase the pain, orders one of the doctors. Kingsley's legs,\nstretched out on a flat board, are raised a bit higher.\n\n   ``How much now?'' the technician asks.\n\n   ``Eight,'' Kingsley signals.\n\n   The magnet emits rhythmical pings. Numbers flash by on computer\nscreens, as activity in Kingsley's brain is translated into\npictures at a rate of 40 images per minute. The doctors and\ntechnicians, standing inside a glass-enclosed control room, watch\nsilently.\n\n   ``How much now?'' the technician asks again.\n\n   ``Nine,'' Kingsley says.\n\n   It may sound reminiscent of some sort of medieval torture\nsession. But in fact, Kingsley, a 39-year-old former construction\nworker, is a volunteer, helping researchers try to understand how\npain works and to find better treatments for patients like him.\n\n   He is one of the first participants in a groundbreaking new\nseries of studies: lying inside the magnetic resonance imaging\nmachine at the State University of New York's Health Science Center\nin Syracuse, he is having moving pictures made of the pain cells in\nhis brain.\n\n   Until very recently, doctors trying to gauge the severity of a\npatient's pain have had to rely largely on what the patient,\nhimself, communicated _ through anything from a wince to a\nblood-curdling scream.\n\n   But using highly refined diagnostic devices like PET      _      or\npositron emission tomography      _      scanning and functional magnetic\nresonance imaging, or fMRI, scientists have been able for the first\ntime to peer deep into the brain and watch pain at work, ``lighting\nup'' specific neurons.\n\n   In studies of 14 patients, Dr. A. Vania Apkarian and a team of\nneurologists, physicists and technicians at Syracuse have used fMRI\nto locate cell groups in the cerebral cortex that are activated in\nresponse to severe pain in the hand, in various back muscles and in\nspinal cord or nerve tissues.\n\n   Apkarian emphasized that it may be several years before the\nmountains of computerized data the team has collected can be\nanalyzed and then used to improve or alter treatment.\n\n   But, he said, the early results seem highly promising,\nespecially when combined with knowledge of brain chemistry gained\nduring the 1980s and the availability of more effective\npainkillers.\n\n   Other research teams in this country and in Canada are\nconducting similar studies. Dr. Karen D. Davis of the University of\nToronto and Toronto Western Hospital and her colleagues, for\nexample, are using imaging to observe changes that occur in the\nbrain cells of patients suffering chronic pain after a stroke or\nspinal cord injury. They are also investigating the ``phantom''\npain many patients experience after a limb is amputated.\n\n   Dr. Howard Field, a neurologist and pain expert at the\nUniversity of California at San Francisco, called the work of\nApkarian, Davis and others ``a major revolution in medicine.''\n\n   The research, he said, is helping dispel false notions about\npain. He said that some doctors, for example, have believed that it\nwas somehow less worthwhile to devote time and energy toward\nlessening a patient's pain than it was to treat the underlying\ndisease or injury. And as late as the late    '   80s, he said, ``the\nmyth persisted that somehow what goes on in the mind, or the cells\nof the brain, is somehow less scientific or real than what goes on\nphysically in the body.''\n\n   But the fact that pain, like blood pressure or body temperature,\ncan now be measured, Field said, will help persuade doctors that\npatients' pain is very real. And it may reassure physicians who\ntreat the most-severe chronic pain, like that of cancer patients.\nIn the past, these doctors have often refrained from giving enough\npain medication to relieve suffering out of fear that their\npatients might become ``hooked'' on the painkillers.\n\n   Pain experts say that having better ways to measure pain also\nwill help protect health insurance companies from fraudulent\nclaims, and help policyholders prove that their claims are\nlegitimate.\n\n   The first success in capturing a still image of pain in the\nbrain was reported in 1991 by a team of researchers in Montreal.\nDr. Jeanne D. Talbot of the University of Montreal, and Dr.\nCatherine Bushnell of McGill University, who used PET scanning,\nwhich, like fMRI, measures blood flow, to watch pain centers of the\nbrain as they processed messages transmitted by nerve cells at the\nsite of the injury.\n\n   When heat was applied at different intensities to the arms of\neight right-handed male subjects, the researchers found, four\ndifferent groups of pain cells ``lit up'' at different intensities.\n\n   In PET scanning, a radioactive tracer is injected into the\nsubject before the scan is taken. When the tracer reaches the\nbrain, detectors in the scanning machine are able to pick up\npositrons _ positive antiparticles of electrons _ emitted by the\nsubstance. The detectors determine where the positrons are located,\nand computers translate the data into three-dimensional pictures.\n\n   Since the discoveries in Montreal, imaging technology has\nsteadily improved. Using these new techniques, neurologists,\nphysicists and physiologists have in effect been given a tour of\npain, as it registers in 200 or more distinct regions of the\ncerebral cortex.\n\n   One of the most immediate uses of the new technology may be to\nhelp identify patients who are suffering, but are unwilling or\nafraid to ask for help.\n\n   In a report last month in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation, for example, Dr. Kathleen Foley, a pain-control\nspecialist at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan,\nreported on the case of ``Mrs. L.,'' a 44-year-old cancer patient\nshe had treated. Mrs. L., Foley wrote, understated the amount of\npain she was in because she wanted to remain lucid.\n\n   ``I haven't really opened my mouth to say I was in pain,'' Foley\nquoted the patient as saying, ``and the trade-off has been a total\nfiasco.''\n\n   Mrs L. added: ``In my stupidity of wanting to stay awake, I say\nthat I'm not in pain, and I find out later that makes it so much\nmore difficult. I want to be awake and know everything that's going\non, for as long as humanly possible. But I do not want to die in\npain. I do not want to be in pain.''\n\n   More common, pain experts say, are patients who could not hide\ntheir pain if they wanted to. Apkarian said the first patients he\nstudied, for example, were suffering from severe hand pain, in each\ncase caused by some kind of accident. In these patients, he said,\npain recurred long after the wound had healed, and the patients'\nhands were often so red and swollen that the nails were dropping\noff.\n\n   There is certainly no doubt that Kingsley is in pain.\nApproaching the huge, donut-shaped M.R.I. machine during a recent\nexamination at University Hospital, he moved very slowly, his\nsuffering obvious.\n\n   Kingsley is in pain about 70 percent of the day, every day, he\nsaid. When he was 19, one vertebrae in the small of his back\nstarted to slip down on another. Doctors told him he had better\nstop lifting heavy things and consider changing jobs.\n\n   ``But I didn't listen,'' he said. ``The lesson from me is that\nif somebody tells you not to lift things, don't lift things.''\n\n   Four years ago, when the pain became unbearable, he finally quit\nhis job. Two operations to insert pins in his back, readjusting the\nposition of the vertebrae, did not help. And heavy doses of\npainkillers brought little relief.\n\n   His doctors said they do not know why he suffers so much. Many\nother people with the same or similar conditions do not approach\nhis level of pain, they said. They suggested that Kingsley might\nwant to join the first group of patients being studied at the\nSyracuse center.\n\n   Inside the laboratory, the MRI machine is sending radio waves\ninto Kingsley's brain while he lies positioned within the machine's\nstrong magnetic field. The waves interact with the nuclei of\nhydrogen atoms in the cerebral cortex, in places where the pain is\nregistered. The nuclei, in turn, emit their own, smaller radio\nsignals, detected by the antenna in Kingsley's headrest, and\ntranslated into images that change slightly as his pain worsens or\nlessens.\n\n   Sean Huckins, a doctoral student in brain mapping, instructs\nKingsley to use a set of hand signals to indicate to the team,\nwatching from the glassed-in control room, the level of pain he is\nfeeling as the technician raises his legs. After each trial, he is\nallowed to rest for a few minutes.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)\n\n   (In Toronto, Davis and her group are developing a more\nsophisticated, computerized system in which patients will roll\ntheir hands on a track ball similar to the mouse on a computer.\nThis will allow pain to be measured on a more finely calibrated\nscale, from 1 to 100. )\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM HERE)\n\n   When Kingsley signals 9{ the trial is halted. It will take weeks\nto analyze the data from his trial in detail, Apkarian said, but\nthe patterns generated by his brain seem, in preliminary analysis,\nto resemble those of the five other back-pain patients he has\nexamined. They differ markedly, though, from those of six patients\nwith chronic hand pain and two patients with spinal disorders.\n\n   ``We've never had brain pictures of chronic pain before, and\nthey show that pain from different types of causes involved very\ndifferent areas of the brain,'' Apkarian said. ``And this seems to\nmean they should be treated differently. Just how will have to be\nsubject to much more investigation.''\n\n   After the session, Kingsley, clearly exhausted, says, ``It hurt\nlike hell. But I'm at the point where I'm willing to try\nanything.''\n\n   ``I've run out of options,'' he continues. ``So why not?''\n\n   The doctors have told him that whatever they learn from the\nresearch for which he has volunteered is unlikely to be of help to\nhim or to others, at least for several years.\n\n   ``But all the patients who are willing and able to undergo this\nvery difficult ordeal say that if makes it possible for other\npeople not have to go what they have gone through, it is worth\nit,'' Apkarian said.\n\n   Kingsley falters only once, when he describes his past life, and\nhow he finally had to quit construction work when he could no\nlonger stand the pain. Tears come to his eyes. ``I can't even get\noff the couch now to play with my grandchild,'' he says.\n","Headline":"\nPAIN AT WORK: STARTLING IMAGES AND NEW HOPE \n","Text":["\n   ``On a scale from 1 to 10, how much pain are you in?'' a\nlaboratory technician asks Bernard Kingsley.\n","\n   Kingsley is lying, cramped, inside a huge magnet, in a space\nnarrow and claustrophobic enough to panic even the brave.
