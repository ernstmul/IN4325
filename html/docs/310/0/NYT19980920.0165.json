Times News Service    \n\n   Linda Gillick began her quest convinced that science and a\nlittle common sense could explain why in one ordinary patch of New\nJersey seashore, an unusual number of children, her son Michael\namong them, have similar types of cancers.\n\n   She reasoned that it must be something in the water or air, some\nunnoticed chemical lurking under a toxic-waste dump or factory _\nbut in any case, a specific factor that she assumed could be\nlocated, analyzed and then eradicated.\n\n   ``When you have something that is grossly abnormal, you need to\nfind out the indicator that is different from somewhere else,''\nsaid Mrs. Gillick, who organized a movement that successfully\nlobbied for a comprehensive environmental study of her town of Toms\nRiver and of surrounding Dover Township in Ocean County. ``What do\nwe have that's different? That's the key.''\n\n   As logical as it may sound, Mrs. Gillick's assumption represents\na challenge to traditional science's previous approach to cancer\nclusters. Many scientists say that they simply do not exist _ that\nthere is a lot of cancer everywhere and that neighborhood\nconcentrations of the disease result from chance, not from the\nenvironment. But people who live in areas where the incidence of\ncancer is higher than expected have rarely been content with that\nexplanation.\n\n   Many of these people are turning their discontent into political\naction. Armed with the clout that gave them an audience with\nPresident Clinton in August and a starring role in some of New York\nSen. Alfonse D'Amato's re-election campaign advertisements, they\nhave become a driving force behind tens of millions of dollars'\nworth of new research into cancer clusters.\n\n   ``This is pushing science to a new era _ of ecogenetic\nepidemiology,'' said Ruth Allen, an environmental epidemiologist\nwith the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. She is the\nagency's project leader for a $21 million study of elevated breast\ncancer rates on Long Island, N.Y. ``This is where molecular\nbiomarkers of disease and geographical variations are examined\ntogether.''\n\n   Across the United States, health officials are re-examining old\nmonitoring data, using newly refined techniques to search for\nchemicals that may not have been looked at in earlier air, water\nand soil tests in communities where cancer clusters are suspected.\n\n   An array of ambitious studies are under way using plain gumshoe\ndetective work combined with computer mapping that can fine-tune\nthe picture of what is in a community's environment, identify how\npeople might be exposed to synthetic chemicals and determine\nwhether small amounts of such chemicals may be toxic to humans.\n\n   In addition to the investigation of certain childhood cancers in\nDover Township and breast cancer on Long Island, there are\nstatewide studies of cancer and chemical use in Connecticut and\nCalifornia, a federal study of elevated breast cancer deaths in\nmid-Atlantic and Northeast states, and federal studies of childhood\nand adult brain cancers near toxic-waste sites in several states.\n\n   Cancer clusters _ the term is used to describe\nhigher-than-expected concentrations of similar cancers in one\ndiscrete area _ have been in the national vocabulary for decades.\nThey can be difficult to document with standard statistical\nanalysis. Sometimes the data involve such small numbers of cases\nthat epidemiologists cannot reach a conclusion about whether an\nanomaly exists. Sometimes, according to the National Cancer\nInstitute, scientists find ``a true excess,'' but cannot explain\nit.\n\n   ``There are so many types of cancer and birth defects that just\nby chance alone you'd expect any one of them to be high in any one\nlittle town,'' said Dr. Bruce Ames, a biochemist and molecular\nbiologist who directs the National Institute of Environmental\nHealth Sciences Center at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n   Expressing a view widely held in the scientific world, he said\nthat the money devoted to research into environmental links to\ncancer is misspent and that there is ``no convincing evidence''\nthat synthetic chemicals in the atmosphere are an important cause\nof cancer in humans. ``I'd put my money into basic research, not\ninto chasing hypothetical risks,'' Ames said.\n\n   Like a growing number of citizen activists, the Gillick family\nwas not willing to have Dover Township's record of childhood\ncancers written off as a statistical fluke. The township in\nsouthern New Jersey has had 90 cases over a 12-year period,\ncompared with the 67 cases that New Jersey health officials said\ncould be expected during that time.\n\n   ``It's important to look at everything _ the water, the soil,\nthe air, all of it, and try to find an answer,'' said Michael\nGillick, who was found to have neuroblastoma when he was 3{ months\nold.\n\n   Now 19, with a shrunken body that is painfully contorted by the\ndisease, he said he realizes that all the research may never tell\nhim why he, or any other cancer victim, is sick. ``It's too late\nfor me,'' Gillick said. ``I already have what I have. I accept it.\nIt's my wish that this not happen to others.''\n\n   Public clamor for answers has prodded many states, including New\nYork and New Jersey, to process and publish cancer data faster.\n\n   In April, for example, the New York state Assembly appropriated\n$1 million for a comprehensive statewide cancer-mapping project. It\nwas to correlate the types and locations of specific cancers,\ninformation already assembled in the state cancer registry, with\nneighborhood-specific data on past and present water quality,\npesticide and chemical emissions, radiation exposure, industrial\npollution and local toxic-waste sites.\n\n   Although Gov. George Pataki vetoed the appropriation, he\npromised that the Health Department would do the study from its own\nbudget. But a department spokeswoman, Claire Pospisil, then said it\ncould not create a meaningful map until it upgraded the registry.\nThis year the department published data from 1994; its goal is to\nhave 1996 data assembled and published by the end of this year.\n\n   Many states, including Hawaii, Illinois and California, have\nundertaken statewide cancer-mapping projects. The proliferation of\ncancer mapping reflects a growing trend nationwide to integrate two\nsets of data that are widely and publicly available: one on\ntoxic-chemical releases and the other on geographical variations in\nthe incidence of some diseases.
