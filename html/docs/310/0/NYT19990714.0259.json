Times News Service   \n\n   ALPE D'HUEZ, France _ At midday on July 5, the American cyclist\nLance Armstrong and the rest of the riders in the Tour de France\nwere taking things easy when the third of the race's 20 daily\nstages began with the riders setting out from the Loire River city\nof Nantes, rolling along at a touristlike 18 miles per hour.\n\n   But in Armstrong's team car, just behind the pack of about 175\ncyclists, things were anything but restful. One of the team's\ndirectors, Johan Bruyneel, was driving and chomping on a baguette,\noccasionally using his knees to handle the steering, as he was\nassaulted by an information frenzy.\n\n   From one speaker, Armstrong, who was in second place that day\nbut is now leading the race, was asking for details on the race\nroute. On the speaker for Radio Tour, the race's common\ncommunications link, the race director was welcoming a long list of\nVIP guests to the race.\n\n   Bruyneel's Nokia hands-free cellular phone chirped the William\nTell Overture to alert him to an incoming call. A tiny Clarion LCD\ntelevision that popped out of the in-dash CD player showed\nhighlights from the previous day's race while a second,\nconventional television gave the team mechanic, Juan Lujan, a good\nview in the back seat.\n\n   Another radio connected to the team's second car blared\ncomplaints from Mark Gorski, the team's other director, that he was\nhaving trouble hearing.\n\n   The only thing missing, it seemed, was a Global Positioning\nSystem receiver offering the precise position of Armstrong and the\nteam's seven other riders.\n\n   ``Oh, I wouldn't want that,'' said Bruyneel, his voice now also\ncompeting with the roar of three low-flying television helicopters.\n``It's a little bit too high-tech.''\n\n   From a great height, the 96-year-old Tour de France appears to\nbe quaintly anachronistic, a throwback to the days of solitary\nchampions and grueling competition, of unruly elements and unlikely\nheroes. But along the 2,500-mile route, it is a Superbowl on\nwheels, as more than 4,500 team members, cycling officials and\njournalists wage their own technological race along the hairpin\nturns and mountain roads.\n\n   For the organizers, an increasingly sophisticated array of\nelectronics helps overcome many of the race's logistical problems.\nBut for the riders, the technology has begun changing the racing\nitself. Teams like Armstrong's have discovered that in a sport\nwhere strategy is as important as speed, information can be power.\n\n   Bruyneel joined the Armstrong team, which is sponsored by the\nUnited States Postal Service, after his own 12-year riding career\nended last season. During his riding days with the Spanish ONCE\nteam, Bruyneel was one of the first cyclists to use a radio during\nthe race.\n\n   The experiment was not highly successful. The bulky radios had\nto be built into helmets, making them uncomfortably heavy. Because\nthey were relatively expensive, even well-financed teams could\nafford only one or two units. Even worse, the systems generally\nproved unreliable. Although cyclists have to keep going even in the\nworst weather, the early radio systems were not up to the job.\n\n   But like personal computers, two-way radios have become more\nsophisticated and much less expensive since the beginning of the\ndecade (although the United States Postal Service team estimates\nthat it has spent $20,000 on communications equipment).\n\n   The daily dressing ritual for Armstrong and his teammates during\nthe three-week Tour now includes depositing a tiny two-way radio in\na back jersey pocket. The rider then threads wires to allow him to\nclip a thumbnail-sized microphone under the front of his jersey and\ninsert an earpiece. Most of the other riders do likewise.\n\n   For George Hincapie, the sprinting specialist on the United\nStates Postal Service team, the radios have meant the end of a\nracing ritual. He no longer has to carry in his back pockets a\npalm-size card giving details about that day's stage: the location\nof tough climbs, easier flat stretches or treacherous curves.\n\n   ``There's no point _ Johan can now give us much more information\nfrom the car,'' Hincapie said. ``Occasionally we don't take the\nradios to a race and we feel completely lost without them.''\n\n   More significantly, the riders' radios allow Bruyneel to shape\nthe team's strategy during the race. Rather like deskbound office\nworkers, professional cyclists must endure seemingly endless\nmeetings where each team member's responsibilities for that day's\nrace are laid out. Of course, the actual race rarely fits the plan.\n\n   Dropping back to a team car for advice was not always an option\nin the past, especially if the inevitable unforeseen development\ninvolved a big increase in speed. When that happened, the team\nleader would generally make a not always fully informed decision\nand try to relay it to his team.\n\n   Now Bruyneel simply analyzes the situation and broadcasts a\nrevised plan. ``It has changed the race a lot,'' Bruyneel said\nwhile flicking the steering wheel to allow another team car and a\nphotographer's motorbike to pass on the narrow road. ``The\ndirectors have much more control over the teams now.''\n\n   On the day the Tour left Nantes, for example, two riders had\npulled ahead of the main group in a breakaway, which meant that the\nbest Hincapie could hope to do in a sprint was place third.\n``George, it's not worth the energy to go for the sprint,''\nBruyneel advised via radio.\n\n   nn\n\n   While the radio gives Bruyneel more control, it also allows\ndissenters to weigh in. The order not to participate in the sprint\nwas immediately followed by a transmission from Armstrong. ``Ah,\ncome on,'' he said in a lighthearted attempt at insurrection. ``Go\nfor it. You can do it!''\n\n   Similarly, Armstrong used the system to great effect during a\ntime trial later in the week that put him in the race leader's\nyellow jersey. Bruyneel radioed a warning that he was about to pass\nhis greatest rival in the race against the clock, Abraham Olano,\neven though Armstrong had started two minutes behind Olano.\n\n   Like everyone at the race, Bruyneel depends on Radio Tour to\ndevelop strategy. The Radio Tour system appeared in a crude form in\nthe late 1960s and has evolved into an extensive operation.\nControlled from two station wagons with antenna forests on their\nroofs that travel in front of and behind the race, the system uses\nthree airplanes flying at 3,000 feet to relay its transmissions\nover routes that generally stretch over 125 miles or more each day.\n\n   On the ground, about 50 official cars, vans and motorbikes of\nthe tour organizer, Societe du Tour de France, feed information\ninto Radio Tour through the antenna-laden cars. Some, particularly\nthe red Lancia carrying the race director, Jean Marie Leblanc, let\neveryone else know what's happening in the race.\n\n   Other transmissions make sure that the hundreds of cars and\ntrucks ahead and behind the race do not become tangled up with the\nriders.\n\n   But the airspace above the Tour is no less crowded. In addition\nto the three Radio Tour planes and the three television\nhelicopters, five airplanes fly overhead to relay live commercial\nradio and television signals.\n\n   The biggest danger now facing the Tour is that its\ncommunications system will turn into an electronic Tower of Babel.\nBecause local cellular phone equipment can be overwhelmed by the\nestimated 3,000 wireless handsets carried by race followers, France\nTelecom now unfolds special truck-mounted high-capacity cellular\ntowers at the start and finish of each day's event.\n\n   Fights over radio frequencies are also developing. The Societe\ndu Tour de France alone operates on 258 radio frequencies. In an\nattempt to keep order, the French government agency responsible for\nassigning radio frequencies has sent technicians to the race for\nthe first time this year.\n\n   ``It's not us who has the problem now, it's them,'' said Didier\nBlondel, the head of telecommunications for the Tour, with obvious\nrelief.\n\n   Still, problems persist. On the way out of Nantes, the United\nStates Postal Service riders mysteriously found themselves\nreceiving instructions intended for a rival French team, Credit\nAgricole. Bryneel took it in stride: ``At least they'll have no\nsecrets from us.''\n\n   Right now, with the exception of television, most of the Tour's\ncommunications use old-fashioned analog systems rather than\nhigher-capacity digital devices. Blondel said that brief\nexperiments with digital radio showed that it had trouble coping\nwith rainstorms and the mountains.\n\n   Nevertheless, Blondel is dreaming of a digital future. He\nsketched out his Tour car of the future while sitting in his\noffice, which, even though it is housed in a fold-out trailer\ntruck, nevertheless has several Gallic touches, including a potted\nartificial rose bush.\n\n   His dream car would have integrated LCD screens on the\ndashboards and seat backs. A computer behind the back seat would\nreceive and decode digital television signals, a digital version of\nRadio Tour and Web pages from the Tour's site.\n\n   ``It's too expensive to do this now and the technology isn't\nperfected, but it will come,'' Blondel promised, presenting his\ndrawing with a flourish.\n\n   Until that happens, Bruyneel will continue with his cellular\nphones, radios and televisions while steering with his knees\nthrough narrow roads filled with rabid European cycling fans. He\nis, as the French say, ``au four, au moulin'' _ ``in the oven, in\nthe mill'' _ the closest phrase in French to ``multitasking.''   \n","Headline":"\nIN THE TOUR DE FRANCE, INFORMATION CAN BECOME POWER \n","Text":["\n   ALPE D'HUEZ, France _ At midday on July 5, the American cyclist\nLance Armstrong and the rest of the riders in the Tour de France\nwere taking things easy when the third of the race's 20 daily\nstages began with the riders setting out from the Loire River city\nof Nantes, rolling along at a touristlike 18 miles per hour.\n","\n   But in Armstrong's team car, just behind the pack of about 175\ncyclists, things were anything but restful.
