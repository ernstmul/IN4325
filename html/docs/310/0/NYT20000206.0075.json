(js) \n By SABRA CHARTRAND   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Pain is a very personal experience, but it soon may be possible\nfor one person to evaluate another's discomfort. Some doctors,\nscientists and researchers believe there is a pattern to pain that\ncan be rated on a universal scale.\n\n   If pain could be reliably evaluated like body temperature, it\nmight be better managed and treated. Health care costs might be\nreduced; workers would have fewer pain-related absences from work;\nand fraud from feigned pain might be eliminated.\n\n   Dr. A. Vania Apkarian, a neuroscientist, and Dr. Nikolaus\nSzeverenyi, a radiological physicist, both at the State University\nof New York in Albany, won a patent last week for a system of\nmeasuring human pain. But Apkarian said that researchers are still\nworking on what to do with the data they can now collect.\n\n   ``This gives us individual brain patterns involved in pain\nsuffering,'' he said. ``That step can be done. How to interpret it\nremains to be accomplished.'' In the meantime, the patented method\ncan be used to obtain data on numerous pain sufferers and create\naverages against which an individual's pain can be measured.\n\n   The researchers also plan to subject volunteers to new pain in\norder to measure their responses.\n\n   ``It depends on the kind of pain someone suffers from,''\nApkarian said. ``If someone has migraine pain, it often gets worse\nwith bright light. So all we do is shine a bright light and say,\nhow much worse did it get, and in what time?\n\n   ``The critical point here is to make the pain change in time,\nand have the subject rate that and use it to record brain\nactivity.''\n\n   Volunteers for the studies decide on the degree of new pain they\nare willing to experience. Each patient is hooked to the monitor\nand to a pain-rating meter called a perceptometer. As the pain is\ninflicted, images of the brain's activity are recorded using an\nimaging machine such as an MRI, a CAT scan or an\nelectroencephalograph. When the patient feels pain, he can send a\nsignal indicating his perceived level of discomfort.\n\n   ``The way we do it now is very simple,'' Apkarian said. ``We\ntell the subjects to think of pain as their fingertips. If the\nthumb and index finger are touching, there is no pain. If they're\nspread as much as possible, that means there is as much pain as\nthey can think of.''\n\n   While the patient is making those judgments, three computers\nmonitor the position of his fingers and record his brain's\nresponse.\n\n   The first computer collects and processes images of the brain.\nThe second controls and varies the pain signals, and downloads the\npatient's responses. The third computer analyzes the data from the\nfirst two, interpreting the brain's response to changing levels of\ninflicted pain. It creates a ``quantitative analysis to\ncharacterize the brain's representation of pain,'' the inventors\nsay in their patent.\n\n   By comparing the results to data from other people with similar\npain and to people who are pain-free, the inventors hope to create\na catalog of different kinds of pain.\n\n   ``Different types of pain have characteristic brain patterns,\nand that is what we are trying to identify,'' Apkarian said. ``Take\nchronic back pain. Is there a characteristic brain pattern for it?\nWe think there is. That becomes a brain map of different pain, and\nwe could compare an individual's map to that, and make a diagnosis\nor prognosis.''\n\n   The system then could be used to monitor pain and its severity,\nhow efficient drugs are in relieving pain, and to differentiate\nbetween types of chronic pain.\n\n   ``In a perfect world, say you suffer from such-and-such a\npain,'' Apkarian continued, ``this will allow us to say here's how\nto cure it, here's the medication you need.''\n\n   The system could also be used to question how a patient says he\nfeels. A person complaining of chronic back pain could have his\nsuffering compared with an aggregate level taken from a group of\npeople with a similar affliction. His brain image would be compared\nto the aggregate image. Any deviations might be considered evidence\nof faked pain.\n\n   Apkarian and Szeverenyi received patent number 6,018,675.\n\n   A Device to Silence Cell Phones\n\n   Motorola has won a patent that may help soothe debates over\ncellular telephone etiquette. When a cell phone rings in a meeting,\na theater or a restaurant, the noise can be annoying or disruptive.\nMost cell phones offer the ``vibrate'' option, a mode in which the\nphone shudders noticeably but silently. The phone owner knows there\nis an incoming call, but if he or she is in a place where answering\nis inappropriate, there are two choices: Ignore the call, or ignore\netiquette.\n\n   Motorola's new patent covers a phone with a ``silent answer''\nkey that puts an incoming call on hold without answering it. A\nperson standing in the middle of a museum gallery would hear the\nphone ring or feel it vibrate, but instead of answering, would\npress that key and activate a prerecorded message.\n\n   The recording would tell the caller that the person he or she is\ncalling is busy but will answer shortly. The message could be\nrepeated until the phone owner has time to walk to the museum lobby\nand take the call.\n\n   Motorola and the system's inventor, Erik Christian Bremer, of\nGlenview, Ill., received patent 6,018,671.   \n\n   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be\nordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent\nand Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.  \n","Headline":"\nPAIN, MEASURED AND COMPARED  \n SILENCING CELL PHONES  \n","Text":["\n   Pain is a very personal experience, but it soon may be possible\nfor one person to evaluate another's discomfort.
