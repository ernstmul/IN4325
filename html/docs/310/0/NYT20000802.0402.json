Doctors confirmed\nafter additional tests that he had suffered the strokes.\n\n   By Wednesday afternoon, Schwartzman said, Ford still was dizzy\nand had slurred speech and trouble swallowing.

Releasing Ford ``was appropriate for the symptoms he had\nlast night,'' said the hospital's Dr. Stephen Klasko, another\nneurologist.\n\n   The type of stroke Ford suffered, likely a cerebral thrombosis,\nis not usually fatal but can sometimes result in temporary or\npermanent physical ailments such as numbness in the limbs and\nspeech impairment or, in more severe cases, reduced cognitive\nskills.\n\n   Strokes occur when sections of the brain are deprived of oxygen,\nwhich is needed to sustain cellular life. There are two broad\ncategories of strokes _ those caused by blockages in arteries in\nthe brain, which account for roughly 84 percent of all strokes in\nthe United States, and those caused by ruptured blood vessels in\nthe brain, which account for 16 percent.\n\n   The latter is more deadly, usually killing half of people who\nare stricken, according to Dr. Abdul Nassief, who is on the faculty\nat Washington University's stroke center in St. Louis. It was this\ntype of stroke that killed Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., last month.\n\n   Ford, however, was apparently stricken by the less deadly\nvariety, which is often called a ``brain attack.''
