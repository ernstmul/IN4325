Times News Service    \n\n   A panel of experts convened to study a class of environmental\ncontaminants known as ``endocrine disrupters'' has concluded that\nnot enough is known about them to determine whether they cause\nhealth problems at the low levels in which they typically occur in\nthe environment.\n\n   The panel, convened by the National Research Council at the\nrequest of federal agencies and Congress, said in its report\nreleased Tuesday that as yet there is insufficient evidence to say\nthe chemicals are causing human cancers and other problems, like\ninfertility. While high concentrations of such compounds, like the\nmedication diethylstilbesterol and the pesticide DDT, can be\nharmful to health, the panel wrote, ``the extent of harm caused by\nexposure to these compounds in concentrations that are common in\nthe environment is debated.''\n\n   In fact, the panel seemed to take pains to refer to the\ncompounds not as endocrine disrupters but rather as ``hormonally\nactive agents.'' The experts said much more research was needed\nbefore the dangers of day-to-day exposures to the contaminants can\nbe ascertained but added that scientists did not agree on what\nexposure levels should be studied or even how to screen for the\ncompounds and their possible influences in people.\n\n   ``This field is rife with uncertainty,'' said Dr. Ernst Knobil,\nwho was chairman of the panel. Knobil, a professor in the medical\nschool at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center,\nadded, ``It's an exceedingly complex environmental issue and there\nare no easy answers.''\n\n   Concerns about endocrine disrupters have been growing for nearly\na decade based on a series of observations and deductions. Certain\npesticides, like DDT and PCBs and chemicals in plastics, mimic the\nhormone estrogen. Wildlife that had been exposed to the chemicals\nin high concentrations were harmed. And women whose mothers had\ntaken high doses of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbesterol when\nthey were pregnant _ in the hope of preventing miscarriages _\ndeveloped vaginal cancers.\n\n   The fear was that as use of these chemicals rose, humans were\nbeing harmed in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\n\n   The panel's report was requested four years ago by Congress, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Congress has directed the EPA to screen compounds for hormonal\neffects, and Tuesday the agency praised the council's report,\nespecially its endorsement of screening and its call for additional\nresearch.\n\n   ``It's a very important report,'' said J. Charles Fox, an\nassistant administrator at the EPA. ``It is very consistent with\nthe research agenda we have developed and in fact the report\nendorses many of the recommendations that we have developed to deal\nwith the potential threat to health and the environment.''\n\n   The report elicited mixed reactions from scientists, ranging\nfrom praise by those who were concerned about the compounds to\nwithering criticism from skeptics of the endocrine disrupter\nhypothesis.\n\n   ``I'm amazed and I'm pleased,'' said Dr. Theo Colborn, a senior\nprogram scientist at the World Wildlife Fund and whose book, ``Our\nEndangered Future,'' helped make ``endocrine disrupters'' a\nnational issue. She said she was delighted that the expert panel\ndid not dismiss suspicions about endocrine disrupters and that it\nagreed with her that at high doses, the chemicals can injure people\nand animals. With the evidence at hand, she said, it is wise to\nfollow the precautionary principle: limit exposure as much as\npossible while research continues.\n\n   ``This is a growing field,'' Dr. Colborn said. ``Just because we\ndon't have the evidence does not mean there are no effects.''\n\n   By contrast, Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American\nCouncil on Science and Health, said she was dismayed by the report.\nThe endocrine disrupter hypothesis, she said, ``has never been\ngrounded in any reality.'' It is easy to call for more research in\nthe absence of evidence of danger, she said. But, she added, that\ndoes not help people who need to know if they should, or should\nnot, be worried about the food they eat, the water they drink, the\nair they breathe, and the plastics they use.\n\n   ``I am now convinced that one of the major problems is that\nscientists are unwilling to use the four-letter word, `safe.''' Dr.\nWhelan said. The council is mostly financed by foundations but also\nreceives some of its money from industry groups.\n\n   Committee members emphasized that they were a diverse group, and\nsaid they had struggled to write a report that all could endorse.\n``It is signed off by the most ardent advocates as well as the most\nardent objectors,'' of the endocrine-disrupter hypothesis, Knobil\nsaid.\n\n   In chapter after chapter, the report examines suspicions about\nthe chemicals, and evidence for the suspicions. In the process, it\nraises questions about virtually every aspect of the field,\nstarting with the description of the chemicals themselves.\n\n   Knobil explained that even when high doses of the chemicals\nelicited adverse health effects, it was never clear that the\neffects were due to endocrine hormone disruptions. DDT, for example\nthinned the eggshells of birds. ``What is the endocrinologic basis\nof eggshell thinning?'' Dr. Knobil asked. ``No one has come up with\none yet.\n\n   ``If you don't know the mechanism, you can't ascribe the effect\nto endocrine disruption,'' Knobil said. The group decided to call\nthe chemicals ``hormonally active agents,'' instead. They defined\nsuch chemicals as any that had hormonal effects in a laboratory\ntest.\n\n   A problem that plagued the group was how to deal with questions\nof exposure level. In general, the chemicals are present in the\nenvironment in minuscule quantities whereas the known effects\noccurred at high concentrations. Moreover, the human body is\nvirtually awash in a sea of naturally occurring hormonally active\nagents that are present in much greater amounts than the chemicals\nin question. These range from hormones made by the body, like\nestrogen and testosterone, to hormones in pills, like birth control\npills, to hormone-like substances in plants that people eat.\n\n   nn\n\n   It is possible that chemicals like pesticides and chemicals in\nplastics interact with these much more abundant hormones in the\nbody, but no one can say for sure, the report said.\n\n   ``We need some quantitative assessments of these interactions,''\nKnobil said, ``and then we need to come to informed and intelligent\nconclusions about what the risks are.''\n\n   The difficulties in getting a handle on the risks posed by the\nchemicals extended from epidemiology to basic biochemistry.\n\n   The chapter of the report on ``Screening and Monitoring'' began:\n``There are no generally accepted, validated methods to screen for\nor monitor exposure to chemicals that could cause adverse hormonal\nactivity _ largely because of the complexity of the endocrine\nsystem.''\n\n   The chapter on ``Neurological Effects'' states in its\nintroduction that some scientists proposed that the chemicals act\non fetuses and cause neurological damage. But, the group wrote:\n``In humans, particularly, a number of difficulties are associated\nwith the investigation'' of neurological effects, ``including the\nrecognition that such effects may be quite subtle, and the possibly\nlong delay between exposure and outcome.''\n\n   One of the most often cited concerns about the chemicals is that\nthey are causing epidemics of breast cancer and male reproductive\nsystem problems, including hypospadia, in which the urethra opens\nat the bottom rather than the top of the penis, undescended testes,\nand lowered sperm counts.\n\n   The panel wrote that studies to date did not support an\nassociation between exposure to the chemicals and breast cancer in\nwomen or hypospadia, or undescended testes in men. The sperm data,\nthe group concluded, were ``controversial.'' The panel members\nwrote in that they had not agreed among themselves about whether\nsperm counts really were declining.\n\n   If the public really does want to get definitive answers to the\nquestions of whether endocrine disrupters are a major public health\nthreat, the studies that would be necessary could last for decades\nand require huge investments from the federal government.
