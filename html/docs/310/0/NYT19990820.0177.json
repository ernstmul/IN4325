Times News Service   \n\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ A Palestinian native whom federal officials have\ntried to deport on the basis of secret evidence suggesting that he\nis linked to terrorism filed suit Friday in federal court\nchallenging the government's use of such evidence.\n\n   The plaintiff, Hany Kiareldeen, has been detained by the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service for 17 months in the Hudson\nCounty Jail near here while the agency has sought to deport him.\nKiareldeen has petitioned a federal judge for his release, saying\nthe use of the evidence _ which he has not been allowed to see and\nis from sources whose identity he has not been allowed to know _\nviolates his constitutional rights.\n\n   ``Depriving someone of his liberty on the basis of secret\nevidence is about as basic a constitutional violation as one can\nimagine,'' said David Cole, a professor and immigration expert at\nthe Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., and a\nvolunteer lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which\nis representing Kiareldeen.\n\n   But in a case that has broken legal ground at almost every turn\nthrough the deportation process and immigration courts,\nKiareldeen's case has been seen as ``remarkable'' by opponents of\nthe use of such evidence.\n\n   The case has even led some immigration court judges to question\nwhether the government's use of secret evidence is too vague.\n\n   Cole and Regis Fernandez, Kiareldeen's other lawyer, are seeking\nhis immediate release on bond while they press his constitutional\nchallenge.

Ahmed served as a court-appointed translator\nfor Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Muslim cleric who was convicted in\nOctober 1995 of masterminding a plot to blow up buildings in New\nYork.\n\n   Although a Justice Department spokeswoman, Carol Florman, would\nnot comment on Kiareldeen's case specifically, she said that the\nuse of secret evidence in cases of national security had been\nupheld over the years by federal courts. Ms. Florman said ``about\n20'' people, all of Arab descent, are being detained and facing\ndeportation on the basis of secret evidence.\n\n   Kiareldeen, who has been in the United States since 1990 and who\nlived in Bloomfield, N.J., was picked up by Immigration and\nNaturalization Service officers in March 1998 for overstaying his\nstudent visa. Once he was in custody, INS officials opposed his\nrelease on bail on the basis of secret evidence, which they did not\ndisclose.\n\n   Subsequently, in a series of deportation hearings, the\nimmigration agency has released sketchy summaries of FBI reports\nthat said Kiareldeen had associated with fundamentalist Muslim\nterrorists involved in the World Trade Center bombing, that he had\nuttered ``a credible threat'' against Attorney General Janet Reno\nand that he had met with one of the key bombing conspirators a week\nbefore the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993.\n\n   From the beginning, Kiareldeen has denied the charges and\nmaintained that they were conveyed to federal authorities out of\nvindictiveness by his ex-wife, Amal Kamal Mohammed. In hearings, he\nhad presented witnesses who testified that, unlike some terrorism\nsuspects, he had no political involvements and was not very\nreligious. Other witnesses told an immigration court judge that\nKiareldeen did not even know who Reno was before he heard he had\nbeen accused of threatening her.\n\n   Fernandez tried to compel Kiareldeen's ex-wife to testify. When\nMs. Mohammed refused, Judge Daniel Meisner of immigration court,\nwho did not have the authority to compel her testimony, asked the\nU.S. Attorney for New Jersey to seek an order from U.S. District\nCourt to force her to testify.\n\n   This marked the first time since their creation in 1996 that any\nof the 200 judges of the immigration courts had sought such an\norder from a federal court.\n\n   But Faith Hochberg, the U.S. Attorney, declined to force Ms.\nMohammed to testify, defying the immigration judge's request.\n\n   Last April, working only from the summaries of the secret\nevidence, Meisner ordered Kiareldeen released on bond. He said\nthat, based on what had come out in the hearings, ``a person of\nordinary prudence and caution could not conscientiously entertain a\nreasonable belief that the allegations of the respondent's\ninvolvement in terrorist activities were true.''\n\n   The INS immediately appealed that ruling. Last month, in a\n2-to-1 ruling, a panel of the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered\nKiareldeen to remain in detention, although the majority said that\nthey had concerns about the reliability of the evidence.\n\n   The dissenting judge went further, writing that the INS and the\nFBI had provided so little to support the allegations that he could\nnot agree to hold Kiareldeen.\n","Headline":"\nPALESTINIAN HELD ON SECRET EVIDENCE CHALLENGES U.S. IN COURT  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ A Palestinian native whom federal officials have\ntried to deport on the basis of secret evidence suggesting that he\nis linked to terrorism filed suit Friday in federal court\nchallenging the government's use of such evidence.\n","\n   The plaintiff, Hany Kiareldeen, has been detained by the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service for 17 months in the Hudson\nCounty Jail near here while the agency has sought to deport him.\nKiareldeen has petitioned a federal judge for his release, saying\nthe use of the evidence _ which he has not been allowed to see and\nis from sources whose identity he has not been allowed to know _\nviolates his constitutional rights.\n","\n   ``Depriving someone of his liberty on the basis of secret\nevidence is about as basic a constitutional violation as one can\nimagine,'' said David Cole, a professor and immigration expert at\nthe Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., and a\nvolunteer lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which\nis representing Kiareldeen.\n","\n   But in a case that has broken legal ground at almost every turn\nthrough the deportation process and immigration courts,\nKiareldeen's case has been seen as ``remarkable'' by opponents of\nthe use of such evidence.\n","\n   The case has even led some immigration court judges to question\nwhether the government's use of secret evidence is too vague.\n","\n   Cole and Regis Fernandez, Kiareldeen's other lawyer, are seeking\nhis immediate release on bond while they press his constitutional\nchallenge.
