My bad luck holds, though: I have done so just as the\nflourishing $2.3 billion a year candle industry is hit by a\ncontroversy over indoor-air pollution.\n\n   A flurry of recent articles says candles are a health hazard.\nAmong the concerns expressed in news reports: that metal wicks can\nrelease lead into the home; the flames can send out dangerous\namounts of soot; and that melting wax can release toxins. A Plano,\nTexas, couple filed suit in September alleging that candles they\npurchased at The Gap, and which they burned for several hours a\nday, created soot problems in their home.\n\n   The Gap has responded in the same way as U.S. candle makers,\nsaying that candles are safe unless misused by consumers.\n\n   So what's the answer? Until the industry resolves the conflict,\na safe step for the consumer is to avoid metal wicks and to limit\nexposure to candle emissions.\n\n   The controversy erupted this fall after a University of Michigan\nstudy said that in spite of an agreement 26 years ago by U.S.\ncandle makers to voluntarily banish lead from metal-core wicks,\nseveral U.S. candles with zinc-cored wicks tested positive for lead\nemissions.\n\n   ``Lead was detected in small quantities in emissions from\nzinc-based wicks, suggesting that the lead may be a common\ncontaminant in the zinc, wick or wax,'' Jerome Nriagu, a University\nof Michigan professor of environmental health, says in a summary of\nhis study.\n\n   Nriagu's study showed that one-third of the 15 candles he tested\nfrom the United States and overseas released more lead into the air\nthan is recommended as safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency. Amounts of lead in the air increased the longer the candles\nburned. Lead emissions were the worst from candles made in China\nand the United States, Nriagu said.\n\n   The National Candle Association, a trade organization in\nWashington, D.C., challenges the study, saying its independent\ntests show that zinc wick cores are widely used in U.S. candles and\nare safe. Candle sellers complain that the study doesn't say which\nbrands were tested, nor does it say if the ``small amounts'' of\nlead in zinc-cored wicks were enough to actually cause health\nproblems.\n\n   _\n\n   Experts _ specifically a NASA scientist, a professor of\nenvironmental health, and a major retailer's manager in charge of\nmeeting government regulations _ agree that candles do have the\npotential to create unhealthful air, but each says that danger can\nbe avoided if some basic safety tips are followed, such as: don't\nlet the candles smoke; use candles with cotton or paper wicks; and\nburn groups of candles in the fireplace.\n\n   It's relatively easy to find candles with cotton or paper wicks.\nEighty percent of U.S.-made wicks are all cotton or paper, says Jeb\nHead, president of Atkins & Pearce, Covington, Ky., the nation's\nlargest wick maker. Metal wicks, which are used to keep the wick\nrigid in some candle shapes and types of wax, are most likely to be\nfound in votives or unusually shaped candles.\n\n   Then there's the issue of smoke. David Urban, chief of\nmicrogravity combustion science at NASA's Glenn Research Center in\nCleveland, says the combustion byproducts of candle flames are\nlargely controllable. Urban has made a career out of researching\nsmoke and flame patterns.\n\n   The bottom line: Keep them out of drafts, and trim the wicks.\n\n   ``You need to limit the wick size to limit the amount of fuel\nreleased into the flame,'' Urban said. ``The longer the wick, the\nmore wax vaporizes into the flame.'' Drafts cause candles to\nflicker, and smoke is released when the flame is disturbed, he\nsaid. ``A little flicker is OK, but not the big flickers.''\n\n   Flickers cause smoke, and that leads to problems of soot, the\nairborne partially burned particles that can settle as dust or be\ninhaled. All flames have soot, or they will not emit much light and\nthey'll be blue, like the flame of a gas burner, Urban said.\n\n   Years ago, when candles were used for light, our grandmothers or\ngreat-grandmothers knew that smoky candles made a house dirty. Back\nthen, candle makers developed self-trimming wicks that curl as they\nburn and don't release as much smoke. But now, with candle sales\nthat are growing at a rate the National Candle Association says is\n10 to 15 percent a year, we are burning more, and we may have\nforgotten what used to be common wisdom, Urban said.\n\n   _\n\n   MORE nn\n\n   If lead and soot aren't enough to worry about, candles contain\nvarious other agents released into the air when burned, such as\nfragrances, wax and dyes.\n\n   Consumers are again left in the dark over the issue of these\n``fumes,'' without any guidance from studies or government\nrecommendations on which candles are safest to burn and how many\nare safe to burn at once.\n\n   The state of California, under its Proposition 65 Safe Drinking\nWater and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, has identified at least\nseven toxins in candles' waxes, including benzene, a carcinogen.\nUnder Proposition 65, a California attorney recently filed an\n``intention to file suit'' against 33 candle makers.\n\n   The ``intention to file'' notice gives candle makers and sellers\nin California 60 days to reformulate their product or put warning\nlabels on candles, or be sued. That case is not resolved, said Lana\nBeckett, a spokeswoman for ``Prop 65 News,'' a publication that\ntracks cases filed under the act. California's attorney general or\ncounty district attorneys can join in the suit if they believe it\nhas merit, but so far they have not, Beckett said.\n\n   The U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission has stayed away\nfrom the issue. Spokesman Ken Giles said the commission has\nrecalled certain candle lines if the wick produced too high a flame\nor if the container broke. But he said the commission doubts most\npeople have enough exposure to large quantities of candle emissions\nto make an inquiry into fumes worthwhile.\n\n   Thorough documentation on exposure has yet to be done and will\nbe a complicated prospect at best because candles are made of so\nmany different substances and burned under so many different\nconditions, said John A. Baker, senior manager for government\nregulations at Pier 1 headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n   Baker said he burns candles at home, where he groups them in his\nfireplace, because he is often burning several at a time to see how\nthey burn. Any candle smoke will go up the chimney.\n\n   NASA scientist Urban burns candles at home, too, choosing the\nclassic dinner-table candle known as a taper, which he said\nreleases the least amount of smoke.
