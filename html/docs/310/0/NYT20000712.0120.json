Times News Service   \n\n   Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet\ncraze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration:\nWhy not try to export the revolution by taking his company's\nsoftware for mobile wireless devices to the United States?\n\n   So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a\ntrans-Atlantic wireless contender.``I had no doubt this thing will\nexplode in America,'' said Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San\nFrancisco. ``The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the\nInternet, PCs, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why\nshouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these\nthings?''\n\n   It is far too early to handicap the chances for OZ, which\nrecently received a large equity investment from Ericsson, the\nSwedish telecommunications company. OZ is but one of many hopefuls\nin a free-for-all involving dozens of other start-ups and large\ntelecommunications companies to develop and promote access to the\nInternet. And like the migrating Mogensen, the wireless Internet\ncraze is coming to the United States from overseas _ primarily\nEurope and Asia, where for various reasons the trend took hold\nfirst.\n\n   The wireless Internet, which provides Web access on devices like\npagers, cell phones and Palm hand-held devices, is being promoted\nas the most promising technological development since the Internet\nitself started taking off in the early 1990s. In two or three\nyears, there are expected to be almost as many wireless Internet\nusers worldwide as people accessing the Web on wired PCs. But given\nthe current state of play in the industry _ and some distinct\ntechnical shortcomings _ can the wireless Web live up to its\nbilling?\n\n   The answer may depend on the ability of companies to wade\nthrough a morass of competing technical standards in their efforts\nto make wireless Web access faster and more convenient. And at\nleast in the early going, American consumers will find that\nwireless Web surfing is a slow, bare-bones experience bearing scant\nresemblance to the hard-wired version.\n\n   ``We're in the euphoria phase right now, where the future seems\nvery bright,'' said Jane Zweig, executive vice president of\nHerschel Shostek Associates, a wireless research firm. ``But pretty\nsoon we'll get to the pain phase, when the complications of the\nwireless Internet will become apparent. Then it'll take a while to\nget to the pleasure and perfection phases.''\n\n   Consumers in this country can already glimpse the wireless\nInternet's potential through applications that enable them to get\nstock quotes, check the weather or send short text messages over\ntheir mobile phones or other devices. And judging from experiences\nin Europe and Asia, Americans have only started to scratch the\nsurface.\n\n   In Japan, teen-agers download still cartoons on services\nprovided by NTT DoCoMo, the country's leading wireless company,\nwhose mobile Internet customers account for 30 percent of Japanese\nWeb users. In Italy, daily horoscopes are the rage. In Finland and\nSweden, one of the hottest applications is a mobile banking service\nallowing people to conduct nearly every banking transaction except\nwithdrawing cash.\n\n   Global growth estimates for the mobile Internet can be heady.\n\n   According to the ARC Group, a London consulting firm, about 100\nmillion of the world's 500 million mobile phones in use by year-end\nwill be capable of Internet access. Within three years, ARC says,\nan estimated 300 million of 900 million wireless phones will be\nInternet-ready. Other industry forecasts say that in five years, as\nmany as 500 million people worldwide _ one of every dozen _ will\nhave phones or other devices capable of wireless Internet access.\n\n   Whether those projections are close to attainable will depend\nlargely on efforts now under way to increase the speed of wireless\nInternet connections. For now, the fastest wireless speeds range\nfrom 9,600 to 14,400 bits a second, much slower than the Internet\nconnections of up to 56,000 bits a second available to people using\ndial-up modems on their home computers. (And, of course, other\nkinds of wired connections, like cable modems or high-speed lines\nare much faster still.)\n\n   Today's wireless speed limits mean that most wireless users in\nthe United States can do little more than send or receive a few\nlines of Internet text through cell phones _ maybe reading a brief\nnews alert about the latest interest-rate decision by the Federal\nReserve, or sending a short e-mail message over a Yahoo or Hotmail\naccount.\n\n   Yet, nearly everyone in the wireless industry agrees that by\nnext year speeds approaching that of a typical home PC connection\nwill be available through wireless devices, allowing sophisticated\napplications like the downloading of images.\n\n   ``Speed is a temporary problem,'' said John Garcia, senior vice\npresident for sales and distribution at Sprint PCS, one of the\nnation's largest wireless operators, which is busily adding\nInternet access to cities throughout its network.\n\n   One reason wireless technology does not yet allow for more\nsophisticated Internet applications is that companies in different\nparts of the world have adopted different technological standards,\ninstead of rallying around a single standard that might ease\ndevelopment of a common mass market for wireless Internet access.\n\n   Europe, for the most part, has adhered to a digital technology\nknown as GSM, which stands for global system for mobile\ncommunications. In Asia, a mixture of standards is in use, with\nCDMA, which stands for code division multiple access, dominant in\nJapan and South Korea, while GSM is sporadically used elsewhere.\n\n   But it is in the United States where standards have been most\nfragmented, helping explain why the wireless Internet has been\nslower to catch on here.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   AT&T uses a format called TDMA, or time-division multiple\naccess. Because TDMA does not support data transmission, AT&T has\nbeen forced to overlay an older format to provide Internet access\nthrough its cell phones, adding further complexity to its current\ngeneration of handsets.\n\n   Meanwhile, other American carriers like Sprint and Verizon have\nadopted CDMA. And still others, including VoiceStream Wireless and\nPacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications use European-style GSM.\n\n   Unless special measures are taken to enable a phone to use\nseveral of these formats, a device designed to work with one\nwireless technology cannot be used on a network that employs\nanother technology.\n\n   Most creators of wireless Internet applications have compensated\nfor this technical Tower of Babel by agreeing to a format called\nWAP _ for wireless access protocol _ which works with any of the\nvarious cellular transmission formats. Any WAP-enabled cell phone,\nused with any flavor of cellular network, can use the same WAP\napplication _ a wireless restaurant locator, for example, a\nstock-quote system or some wireless Internet offering. (The iMode\ntechnology used by NTT DoCoMo in Japan is not WAP compatible.)\n\n   Taken together, the disparate carrier standards are known as the\nsecond-generation of wireless technology _ the first generation\nhaving been the nondigital analog technology that the original\ncellular industry rolled out in the 1980s. Over the next two to\nfive years, the global wireless industry expects to move to a\nso-called second-and-a-half digital generation, followed by a third\ngeneration. The differences can be arcane, but the coming\ngenerations of formats are meant to allow for much higher data\nspeeds _ and to be compatible with one another.\n\n   Whether WAP continues through these next generations, or is\nreplaced by a new format for programmers who write the application\nsoftware, the next generations of wireless technology should make\nit easier to roam from one continent to another with a single\nhand-held Internet access device. And the ability to send larger\namounts of data may make the wireless Internet an option for\nbusinesses and individuals.\n\n   ``Sooner than you think, we'll be able to do videoconferencing\nwith wireless access,'' said Anil Khatod, president of global\nInternet solutions at Nortel Networks, the maker of network\nequipment.\n\n   Along with Nortel, companies like Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent and\nNokia are competing for tens of billions of dollars of contracts to\nbuild new generations of wireless networks. Last year, the value of\nwireless infrastructure contracts worldwide reached $28.7 billion,\na 22 percent increase from 1998, according to the Cahners In-Stat\nGroup, a research firm. Some of those companies, along with others\nlike Palm, Research in Motion and the Swatch Group, are developing\nnew types of devices for sending and getting wireless data and\nimages.\n\n   ``We are coming up with things that will make your head spin,''\nsaid Lawrence Rabiner, vice president for research at AT&T Labs.\nOne of AT&T's projects under development is a pair of\nInternet-accessible ski goggles with a built-in wireless phone that\nwould allow skiers to hold conversations, transmit a video of their\ndownhill descent or pull down a course map projected onto a visor.\n``It's James Bond, `Mission Impossible' stuff,'' Rabiner said.\n\n   Of course, there are big questions about how many new mobile\nInternet services people really want, and how practical it will be\nto provide or to use the most exotic applications.\n\n   ``Obviously the whole wireless Internet nirvana hype sells a lot\nof papers,'' said Mark F. Bregman, who as head of pervasive\ncomputing at IBM is working on third-generation and even\nfourth-generation wireless technology. ``We need to realize that\nthe wireless Internet is not a panacea, that some things like doing\nvideo on a cell phone would be impractical because video hogs so\nmuch bandwidth.''\n\n   To be sure, there are concerns about the amount of available\nradio-wave spectrum that can be used to transmit wireless data. And\nsome industry executives worry quietly about whether some consumers\nmight get turned off at this early, homely stage in the industry's\ndevelopment.\n\n   But despite such qualms, many new participants are entering the\nwireless fray _ including Brad A. Silverberg, a former high-ranking\nMicrosoft executive who led the company's Windows business. In\nMarch, Silverberg and former executives from McCaw Cellular formed\nthe Ignition Corp., an investment firm focused entirely on wireless\nInternet ventures.\n\n   ``This is a huge wager we're making, but my instinct tells me\nthe wireless Internet is the next tech tidal wave, like the PC and\nthe Internet itself,'' Silverberg said. ``Will we win the bet? If\nyou judge our chances by the number of people and amount of\nresources committed to this thing, I'd say they are very good.''\n\n     \nNYT-07-09-00 1747EDT  \n","Headline":"\nUNTANGLING THE WIRELESS WEB \n","Text":["\n   Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet\ncraze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration:\nWhy not try to export the revolution by taking his company's\nsoftware for mobile wireless devices to the United States?\n","\n   So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a\ntrans-Atlantic wireless contender.``I had no doubt this thing will\nexplode in America,'' said Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San\nFrancisco. ``The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the\nInternet, PCs, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why\nshouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these\nthings?''\n","\n   It is far too early to handicap the chances for OZ, which\nrecently received a large equity investment from Ericsson, the\nSwedish telecommunications company.
