McFADDEN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ A small tumor was removed from the surface of the\nbrain of Cardinal John O'Connor last week by doctors at Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and a course of radiation therapy is\nto begin shortly and continue for several weeks, a spokesman for\nthe Archdiocese of New York announced late Saturday.\n\n   Joseph Zwilling, the cardinal's spokesman, gave no prognosis and\nfew medical details in a brief statement, but said that doctors had\ndetermined that ``no other areas of the body were affected.''\n\n   The announcement by Zwilling said that the 79-year-old\narchbishop of New York had been released from the cancer center\nSaturday morning, after a 10-day hospitalization, and that he had\nreturned to his residence on Madison Avenue at 51st Street, behind\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\n   Zwilling described the cardinal as being ``in good spirits,''\nand said that he continues to work, has been celebrating Masses\nprivately during his hospitalization, and was looking forward to\nreturning to ``a full and vigorous'' schedule. But he noted that\nthe cardinal's schedule ``will be somewhat lessened for the\nimmediately future.''\n\n   O'Connor, who has been the spiritual leader of 2.3 million Roman\nCatholics in the Archdiocese of New York for more than 15 years and\nis regarded as Pope John Paul II's most important American ally,\nwas admitted to the cancer center on Aug. 25 after experiencing\nweakness and nausea.\n\n   Zwilling said that a team of doctors under the leadership of Dr.\nKevin M. Cahill, his personal physician, and Dr. Thomas J. Fahey of\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering, had performed ``a thorough series of\ntests over six days,'' the results of which were given to the\ncardinal last Friday.\n\n   The announcement, made shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, said:\n``Doctors removed a small tumor from the surface of the cardinal's\nbrain. They determined that no other areas of the body were\naffected. A course of radiation therapy will begin shortly and\ncontinue over the next several weeks.''\n\n   The statement did not say when or by whom the operation had been\nperformed, and it gave no details about the precise size or nature\nof the tumor that was removed, its position on the surface of the\nbrain, or the medical prognosis. Zwilling said he could not release\nany more medical information about the tumor, or the operation to\nremove it.\n\n   Zwilling said that the cardinal would not celebrate Mass\npublicly at the cathedral Sunday, and that he had scheduled no\npublic events for the remainder of the Labor Day weekend. He noted,\nhowever, that the cardinal had been celebrating Masses in his\nhospital room and that, after his release at 10 a.m. Saturday, he\nhad celebrated Mass in a chapel at his residence.\n\n   ``While the cardinal's schedule will be somewhat lessened for\nthe immediate future, he is looking forward to returning to the\nfull and vigorous schedule which he has followed since becoming the\narchbishop of New York,'' Zwilling said. ``The cardinal is in good\nspirits. He has been celebrating mass privately, and he continues\nto work on the business of the archdiocese.''\n\n   Zwilling also said that the cardinal had extended ``deep\npersonal gratitude'' to doctors, nurses, technicians and support\nstaff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who had cared for him, and to New\nYorkers and others who had prayed for him and conveyed their good\nwishes.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\n   After the cardinal entered the hospital last month, Zwilling\nsaid that the choice of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, one of the\nnation's most prominent cancer centers, did not necessarily mean\nthat he had cancer. He also declined to say whether the cardinal\nhad a history or a family history of cancer, hypertension,\ncardiopulmonary illness or other medical problems. The hospital,\nciting privacy considerations, also declined to provide details.\n\n   Regardless of his health, the cardinal may retire on his 80th\nbirthday in January. In 1995, when he turned 75, he submitted his\nresignation to the pope, in accordance with church law. But the\nVatican declined to accept, ``until other provision is made,''\nwhich was widely interpreted to mean until a suitable successor\ncould be found.\n\n   But so far, no successor has been announced. Church law\nprohibits a cardinal who turns 80 from voting for a new pope, and\nit has been widely reported that the cardinal might retire in\nJanuary, although church officials have said such a decision would\nultimately be up to the pope.\n\n   The cardinal has had a number of minor illnesses in recent\nyears. In 1991, he was briefly hospitalized for heat prostration.\nIn 1992, he collapsed at the Alfred E. Smith black-tie dinner, and\nwas hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital for what was later\ndiagnosed as a stomach virus.\n\n   In 1993, he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate, and in\nApril 1998 he had minor surgery to remove a growth from his nose.\nThe cardinal's last illness was in January, when a bout of the flu\nworsened as he accompanied the pope on a trip to Mexico. He was\nunable to continue with the pope on a later stop in St. Louis.\n\n   Word that the cardinal had undergone surgery for a brain tumor\ndrew expressions of concern from a number of people at St.\nPatrick's Cathedral, where an announcement was read out at a Mass.\n\n   ``I hope he's all right,'' said Jim St. John, of Fort\nLauderdale, Fla., who had not attended the Mass, but was drawn to\nthe cathedral by the crowd of reporters waiting outside, fearing it\nmight mean bad news about the cardinal.\n\n   ``He's the spokesperson of the American church now,'' St. John\nadded. ``He's brilliant. He's done more for the church than anyone\nin this century. I was here for his installation and that makes it\nvery emotional for me. We're all very interested to find out what's\ngoing to happen to the church with his retirement pending. We're\njust praying. We're just waiting. I'm sure the Holy Spirit will\nguide what goes on.''\n\n   Mary Jo Dinan, of Oshawa, Ontario, who attended the Mass at St.\nPatrick's, said: ``We didn't realize he was ill, and we're glad\nthey kept us up to date. It is very important that they inform the\nparishioners. Our prayers will be that he has a very speedy\nrecovery.''\n\n   Her husband, David, said of the church: ``It's a close-knit\ncommunity. Prayers are being said across North America for the\ncardinal. Our parishes will be saying prayers for him as well.''\n\n   Shelly Skosky, of Collinsville, Ill., said solemnly: ``I hope he\nrecovers.
