The University of Washington is one of\nthe few institutions in the world studying surgical ultrasound.\n\n   Researchers hope that within a few years hand-held ultrasound\ndevices will be used to detect and stop internal bleeding for\ntrauma patients in remote locations, such as the mountains, or on\nthe battlefield.\n\n   Eventually, it may be possible to do ultrasound scans of the\nwhole body, and eradicate tumors that show up at the same time,\nresearchers said.\n\n   ``It's not that far away,'' said Larry Crum, chairman of the UW\ndepartment of acoustics and electromagnetics at the Applied Physics\nLaboratory. ``It's not a Star Trek thing.

At this focal point, they cause a rapid, intense\nheating of the tissue, cauterizing it. If the beam is focused on a\nbleeding vessel or artery, it will cause the blood to coagulate and\nstop the bleeding. If it is focused on a tumor, it will destroy the\ntissue, rendering the tumor harmless.\n\n   Most people are familiar with ultrasound for its ability to\nreflect images of the developing fetus in a pregnant woman. Those\nultrasound waves, which are not harmful, are very low intensity.\n\n   Ultrasound used for surgical purposes is 10,000 times as intense\nand must be focused using mechanical or electronic means before it\ncan act to destroy tissue.\n\n   The beauty of it is how precise it is, said Gail ter Haar f the\nRoyal Marsden Hospital in England, who was at the Seattle meeting\nand is conducting clinical trials on patients with tumors of the\nliver, kidney and prostate.\n\n   The focus is so precise that doctors can control within six\ncells exactly where the ultrasound waves cause the desired effect.\n\n   ``It's a very sharp boundary,'' she said. ``It's sharper than a\nscalpel.''\n\n   The problem with many surgeries is that ``you do a lot of\ncutting and damage to normal tissue to get to something abnormal,''\nsaid Dr. Stephen Carter, a radiologist at the UW School of Medicine\nwho works with Crum. That's especially problematic in areas, such\nas the brain, where damaging normal tissue can have serious\nconsequences.\n\n   ``If you can not damage normal tissue, it's a tremendous\nadvantage,'' he said.\n\n   Ultrasound, which is very high frequency sound energy, is\nideally suited to surgical applications. Microwaves can't be\nfocused on such small areas, X-rays damage tissue on the way in,\nand lasers can't penetrate the tissue, Crum said.\n\n   The treatment is especially promising for tumors in areas where\noperating is risky or impossible, such as the liver.\n\n   Many patients survive treatment for their primary cancers, only\nto die when tumors spread to their livers, ter Haar said.\n\n   In other cases, such as prostate cancer, surgery can have\nunintended consequences.\n\n   In men with advanced prostate cancer, the treatment sometimes\nrequires removal of the whole prostate, Crum said.
