Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, who has been undergoing\nradiation treatments for a brain tumor, was readmitted to the\nhospital Monday at the request of his doctors, the cardinal's\nspokesman said.\n\n   O'Connor, 79, the archbishop of New York, entered Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan at 3 p.m., said Joseph\nZwilling, his spokesman. O'Connor was expected to stay at least one\nnight.\n\n   ``The cardinal is experiencing fatigue from the therapy, which\nis normal,'' Zwilling said. ``But given his age and the relatively\nhigh dosages of radiation he is receiving, his doctors wanted to\nmake sure he is recovering normally.'' They also want to insure\nthat the cardinal is not becoming dehydrated because of the\ntherapy, Zwilling said.\n\n   Asked whether the cardinal had lost any weight, Zwilling said,\n``I'm not sure.''
