Times News Service   \n\n   ``From this Tour de France, we asked for the moon; it gave us\nArmstrong,'' wrote the French journalist Claude Droussent, in this\nweek's issue of L'Equipe magazine. He referred, of course, to Lance\nArmstrong, the heart-emboldening and heartbreaking winner of the\nworld's great bike race, completed Sunday afternoon in Paris, under\nthe shading trees along the Champs-Elysees.\n\n   ``The moon, in this month of July 1999,'' added Droussent,\n``would have been a Tour freed of its doubts and suspicions if not\nall doping.''\n\n   Curiously, 30 years ago this month, Earth, in effect, asked for\nthe Moon, too, and it also gave us Armstrong. That is, Neil\nArmstrong, the first man to walk _ or hop about, as it were _ on\nour mystical and mysterious rock and metaphor.\n\n   Underlining the achievements of each of these strong-minded\nArmstrongs was something beyond the science of NASA and the\ntechnology of Lance Armstrong's two-wheeler. It was something\nbeyond the dark but starry 250,000-mile distance from Cape\nCanaveral to the Sea of Tranquillity that Armstrong's Apollo\ncapsule traveled, and it was something over and above the\nthree-week, 2,290-mile journey from Le Puy du Fou to Paris, from\nthe French Alps to the River Seine.\n\n   There was the crossing, or exceeding, or simply the stretching\nof the indeterminate boundaries of the human mind and spirit.\n\n   Neil Armstrong, along with his crew, didn't know if he would\nreturn from the Moon _ or get there at all without drifting off\nforever into space. Was this curtains?\n\n   Lance Armstrong also faced the distinct possibility of death.\nThree years ago, at age 25, he was found to have an especially\nlethal variety of testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs\nand abdomen and brain. He underwent surgery to remove the tumors\nand lesions, and doctors gave him no more than a 50 percent chance\nof survival. After intense chemotherapy, and still riding his\nbicycle 30 to 50 miles a day, the cancer disappeared.\n\n   ``A miracle,'' he said.\n\n   Other people have recovered from the kind of cancer he had _ he\nis cancer free now, with only a 2 percent chance of it coming back\n_ but they don't throw themselves into the kind of exhaustive\nphysical activity that Lance Armstrong has. As Dr. Lawrence\nEinhorn, the oncologist who supervised Armstrong's treatment, said,\nsuch survivors may go back to work behind desks, but not behind\nhandlebars.\n\n   When first stepping space boot onto the bald surface of the\nMoon, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong said famously, ``That's one\nsmall step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'' He spoke of the\nbreaking of barriers of what was heretofore deemed implausible, if\nnot impossible. And opened up new avenues of the mind.\n\n   Lance Armstrong broke barriers, too. He seemed to put to rest\ntalk that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs _ such scandals\nhad marred that race and other cycling races in previous years _\nwhen it was determined that medication he had used was for\ntreatment of his cancerous condition.\n\n   ``That kind of talk, it makes me sick,'' he said of the drug\nrumors. ``But when the race is over, that stuff doesn't live. The\nvictory and the people that I touch and the story that I can tell _\nthat lives. I'm proud to be a cancer survivor and I'm proud to do\nthis, I really am. This race and my performance here are going to\naffect a lot of people in a positive way, in a wonderful, fantastic\nway.''\n\n   Having lived with the devastation of cancer in my own immediate\nfamily, the idea of hope _ as remote as it may sometimes seem _ and\nsymbolized in Armstrong's spectacular accomplishment, cannot be\nminimized.\n\n   Sometimes there are miracles, sometimes not. I interviewed Neil\nArmstrong some 10 years after his Moon walk. He said he was\ndisappointed that mankind seemed no more united after the Moon\nlanding than before. ``I had hoped the Moon shot would take our\nminds away from the more mundane and temporal problems that have\nface us,'' he told me. ``But we still appear to be tied up with\ntoday's problems.'' However, Lance Armstrong's message exactly 30\nyears and 5 days after Neil Armstrong's is that we must keep\ntrying. Lance Armstrong's message is that there is the decided\npossibility that mind _ and heart _ can win out over pure matter.\n\n   After Lance Armstrong's race was won, he was checked for\nunsuitable properties. When Neil Armstrong returned to Earth, he\nwas quarantined for possibly carrying lunar germs. Both were\ncleared, and have entered the pantheon of honored conceivability,\nof, by courage and pluck, making dreams come true.  \n","Headline":"\nSPORTS COLUMN: ARMSTRONGS EMBODY OUR HEART AND SPIRIT\n","Text":["\n   ``From this Tour de France, we asked for the moon; it gave us\nArmstrong,'' wrote the French journalist Claude Droussent, in this\nweek's issue of L'Equipe magazine.
