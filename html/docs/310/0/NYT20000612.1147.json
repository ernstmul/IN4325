Times News Service    \n\n   Jon Silvan likes to think of himself as someone who is\ncomfortable with technology, who can understand and use the latest\ngadgetry that modern life brings his way. But the radio in his new\nBMW 740i, of all things, had him flummoxed. Trying to use the\nradio's touch screen made him feel as if he were on his first day\non the job behind the soundboard at a rock concert.\n\n   ``You have to go through so many screens just to get to the\nscan,'' said Silvan, a partner in a market research firm in New\nYork. ``For $70,000 you'd think it would be easier to figure out.''\nDuring several trips commuting to and from home, he discovered that\nthe scanning feature was actually a subset of the Select screen,\nwhich also included Manual Start and Automatic Scan options. ``I\nhave no idea what those do,'' Silvan said.\n\n   As car radios have evolved into control centers for more\nsophisticated audio systems in the last few years, they have become\nincreasingly complicated to use. Buttons and dials perform more\nfunctions, and because radios must share dashboard space with other\ndevices, including satellite navigation systems, they have gotten\nsmaller as well.\n\n   ``We're adding a ton of features and still trying to keep the\ninterface as simple as possible, which is a huge challenge,'' said\nJim Foley, a technical specialist at Visteon _ now the Ford Motor\nCo.'s automotive parts unit in Dearborn, Mich., but soon to become\nan independent company. Foley said Visteon tested its dashboard\naudio interfaces by putting test subjects in arcade-style driving\nseats and watching how long it took them to do things like insert\nCD's and press preset buttons.\n\n   The explosion of functions on today's car radios has led to a\ncertain nostalgia among drivers for the plain old knob that\nadjusted the volume or tuned in a station. ``Knobs were easier to\nuse when you're driving,'' said Marie O'Neill, of Upper Arlington,\nOhio, who buys a new car about every four years and frequently\ndrives long distances. ``Now I have an arrow button, which I\nfrequently have to push and push without getting anything.''\n\n   Tom Magliozzi, co-host of ``Car Talk,'' a program on National\nPublic Radio, said: ``The trend I see is that the more expensive\nthe car, the more complicated the car radio is. They're doing it\nbecause if you're paying $75,000, they think you must want\nsomething fancy. You don't want a plain old radio.''\n\n   Magliozzi said he thought that the touch-screen menus found on\nthe radios in some expensive vehicles could be dangerous. ``Even if\nyou figure out how to use one,'' he said, ``you still have to go\nthrough this business with the touch-screen menus to get to the\nradio. How are you going to use a touch screen when you're driving\na car? They think you're sitting at your desk.''\n\n   Just as they do with computer software and home entertainment\nsystems, many people take the time to learn only what they need to\non their car radios and leave the more sophisticated functions\nalone.\n\n   ``There's a button on my radio called Phone,'' said Earl Hefley,\na musician in Oklahoma City, ``and I think it's some kind of mute\nswitch for when you're on a cell phone, but I don't know. I'm\nconvinced that the secret to it all is to read the book.'' And he\nwould read the owner's manual, Hefley said, if it wasn't so long.\n\n   Mark Erdman, manager of Radios, Knobs, Speakers and Things, a\ncar audio store in Pontiac, Mich., said that when his employees\ninstalled a new radio, they showed the customer how to do basic\nthings like programming in favorite stations and setting the clock.\nBut the customers often return when they forget what they learned.\n\n   ``We spend a lot of time training them, and retraining them, and\nretraining them again,'' Erdman said. ``The more money you spend,\nthe more features you have to learn. In a lot of cases the radios\nare overfeatured for what the customer will use them for.''\n\n   Car radio manufacturers, including Delphi Delco Electronics\nSystems, which makes radios for General Motors, Toyota and\nVolkswagen, say they are working to make radios easier to use while\ndriving. ``We've been moving to larger buttons with differentiating\nshapes to allow the driver to operate by feel without taking their\neyes off the road,'' said Ken Erickson, product line manager for\naudio systems at Delphi Delco. The radios the company makes for\nBuicks, for example, now have dimpled volume knobs as well as\nlarger display screens.\n\n   Some companies, like Ford and General Motors, are looking at\nvoice activation to help limit the number of buttons and make it\nsafer for people to fiddle with the radio while driving. Next year,\nCadillac Sevilles and Devilles will offer an optional system made\nby Delphi Delco that will let drivers send e-mail, talk on a cell\nphone and activate radio and CD functions with voice commands.\n\n   Visteon has already incorporated optional voice-activated\ncontrols into the Jaguar S-Type's radio and CD changer. The radio\nlets the driver tune into favorite stations by saying ``radio'' and\nreciting the station's call letters, numbers or preset number. To\nprevent the radio from getting confused when people talk inside the\ncar, the Jaguar's voice activation requires the push of a button.\n\n   Many car companies, like Ford, Toyota and General Motors, also\noffer optional steering wheel controls that let drivers increase\nand lower volume or change stations or CD tracks without touching\nthe dashboard.\n\n   ``We do what we can to keep the drivers' hands on the steering\nwheel and their eyes on the road,'' said Anders Hellen, an\nergonomic specialist at the Volvo Car Corp.\n\n   Â \n","Headline":"\nFOR THE CAR RADIO, A MIDLIFE CRISIS \n","Text":["\n   Jon Silvan likes to think of himself as someone who is\ncomfortable with technology, who can understand and use the latest\ngadgetry that modern life brings his way.
