Cancer is a hit-and-run, guerrilla fighter.\nIt blends with healthy cells until it can mount an attack in the\nform of a tumor or lesion. In many cases, by the time a doctor or\npatient notices something out of the ordinary, cancer cells _ too\nsmall to detect by conventional methods _ are on their way to\nattack other parts of the body.\n\n   Cancer has a voracious appetite and unique abilities to draw on\nthe body's resources to grow faster than normal cells, making it an\nefficient killer that claims roughly half a million American lives\nevery year.\n\n   But those same unique traits may also be its Achilles' heel.\n\n   Southern California cancer hunters like Cote are refining\nmethods to spot those differences and shed some light on the\nelusive disease. The scientists say that seeing cancer is crucial\nin designing more effective treatments and, hopefully, another step\ntoward finding a cure.\n\n   Using complex molecular probes designed to seek out traits\nspecific to cancer, Cote and his associates at USC actually have\nbeen able to color cancer cells in bone marrow and lymph node\nsamples.\n\n   It's a lot like flipping on a light switch inside the invading\ncells. A slide that once appeared to show only a field of healthy\ncells suddenly reveals a string of cancer cells on the move, a\nmetastasis. Cote believes the cells are scouting sites to begin a\nnew assault on the body.\n\n   The research is currently being evaluated in a multicenter\nclinical trial, but the implications are profound for patients. For\nexample, most women with breast cancer undergo unpleasant\nchemotherapy after surgical removal of a tumor even though as many\nas 70 percent don't really need it. The problem: There is no\neffective way to tell which women still have cancer lurking in\ntheir bodies and which don't. Cote hopes his research will provide\nthat.\n\n   ``Patients who have these cells in their bone marrow or lymph\nnodes are at significantly greater risk for developing overt\nmetastatic disease than are the patients who do not have these\ncells,'' Cote said. ``The tumor that has spread is the tumor that\nis going to kill the patient, so the consequences are profound. And\nthe economic consequences are also quite profound because right\nnow, basically, everyone is treated.''\n\n   It's intriguing news, but like many promising cancer studies,\nthe medical profession demands solid proof before it embraces the\nconcept.\n\n   ``It's very exciting, but it's been a long road,'' Cote said of\nhis 14-year pursuit of occult metastases. ``It seems to be a very\nstraightforward concept, but it's taken many, many years for it to\ngain even a modest level of acceptance. It represents a\nfundamentally different way to look at a cancer patient, and\nthere's always a natural resistance to that.''\n\n   Dr. Peter Conti is familiar with that resistance. As director of\nUSC's positron emission tomography (PET) lab, Conti works with one\nof the most promising and powerful diagnostic tools in the fight\nagainst cancer.\n\n   But the machine is just now being accepted by health insurers\ndespite the fact it's been around for more than a decade. (It was\ninvented in 1973 at Washington University in St. Louis by Dr.\nMichael Phelps and his colleagues.)\n\n   Conti said the use of the machine has been clouded by regulatory\nred tape and resistance from insurance companies because of its\ncost: $2,000 per scan.\n\n   ``It's only in the last year or two it's starting to take hold,\nbut we've been fighting this battle for over a decade,'' Conti\nsaid.\n\n   Unlike X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans that take\npictures of the body's anatomy, PET scans peer into the body's\nmetabolism. PET scans take advantage of cancer's voracious appetite\nfor glucose, the body's fuel. Radiologists inject a patient with a\nglucoselike substance tagged with a radioactive tracer. Since\ntumors take in more glucose than healthy cells, they also suck up\nthe tracer, which shows up on the PET scan.\n\n   Unlike magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses the body's\nhydrogen atoms to create detailed internal images, PET often can\ndifferentiate between scar tissue and tumors more effectively,\nConti said.\n\n   ``We've been able to see a lot more disease,'' Conti said.\n``It's opened up a lot more opportunities in terms of diagnosing\nthe stage of the disease and monitoring the effectiveness of\ntherapy.''\n\n   That can be a mixed blessing. Take the case of a 71-year-old man\nwith metastatic melanoma. The disease was discovered first in his\nleft shoulder; CT and bone scans later revealed the disease near\nhis spine and in his leg.\n\n   But a PET scan revealed cancer lesions throughout his body _ a\nfatal diagnosis. Surgeons canceled a planned amputation of his leg,\nwhere they originally thought most of the cancer was concentrated;\nthe surgery would not have saved him. It's grim news, Conti admits,\nbut it also allowed the man to spend the remainder of his life with\nhis family instead of recovering from a traumatic and pointless\nsurgery. And, on a more commercial level, his insurance company\nsaved thousands of dollars.\n\n   On the positive side, PET scans can help doctors plan the amount\nof chemotherapy to give a patient, based on the rate the cancer has\nspread.\n\n   PET also promises to help researchers evaluate gene therapy, a\npotentially exciting cancer treatment that is just now being\nevaluated in humans.\n\n   Dr. Harvey Herschman, a molecular biologist at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, is refining a method that will track genes\nthat have been modified by scientists to fix a variety of maladies\n_ from cancer to cystic fibrosis.\n\n   For example, so-called therapeutic genes may one day be used to\nsuppress or shut down cancer genes before they start working\n(called expression), replace bad genes with improved genes, or even\nkick the body's immune response to cancer into overdrive.\n\n   Unfortunately, just as cancer is tough to see inside the body,\ngene therapy pioneers have no idea where their treatment goes and\nhow _ or even if _ it's working once it enters the body.\n\n   ``We don't have any way to measure that,'' Herschman said.\n``Essentially, all you can do is ask if the patient is getting any\nbetter. So what we've done is develop techniques where we link the\ntherapeutic gene to a gene whose expression we can measure with\nPET.
