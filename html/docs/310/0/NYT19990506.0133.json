It's a matter of just a few years.\n\n   So why do statistics show that analog service is still used by\n75 percent of the nation's 60 million wireless cell phone users?\nEven though digital service edged out analog last year for the\nfirst time ever in the competition for new subscribers, it still\nmeans\n\n   that nearly 12 million Americans who jumped into the wireless\nworld last year chose analog.\n\n   Are they fools?\n\n   Not at all. Analog phones offer American consumers a low-cost\nway to try out wireless phone service without the big investment\nfor a digital phone. Entry-level digital phones cost at least $100\nor so, while the analog handset costs little or nothing.\n\n   Consumer advocates quibble with the words ``costs nothing'' or\n``free'' to describe the giveaway of analog handsets; they say you\nultimately pay for the phone through higher per-minute costs.\nNonetheless, it's clear that you cough up less money overall in the\nfirst year by going with a basic analog plan rather than a digital\none.\n\n   And if you're the kind of person who wants a wireless phone for\nconvenience, and in case of emergencies, you'll appreciate that\nanalog services still trump digital when it comes to blanket\ncoverage across the country. Analog has just been around longer,\nand has more antenna sites up from coast-to-coast, especially in\nrural areas.\n\n   That said, digital phones have many major advantages, including\nbetter voice quality and protection from eavesdropping. And for\npeople who use their wireless phones a moderate amount, about 100\nminutes or so each month, digital services _ with their\nincreasingly popular one-rate plans _ start to become cheaper than\nanalog, even if you factor in the cost of the phone. Digital\none-rate plans can cost as little as a dime a minute.\n\n   Digital is simply a superior and more efficient technology.\nAnalog has the drawback of having to transmit a person's entire\nvoice over a radio channel. Even if there's silence on both ends of\nthe phone, that radio channel is still tied up. There are a limited\nnumber of channels, and if you've ever tried to call your spouse as\nyou're driving home in a blizzard and can't get through, it's\nbecause virtually everyone else on the road with you is also trying\nto call home on their analog phones.\n\n   And if the call is intercepted somehow, you better believe the\nstranger listening in can understand every word. Just ask former US\nHouse speaker Newt Gingrich, whose cell phone conversation about\nhis ethics problems was later broadcast to the world.\n\n   Digital technology, on the other hand, converts the phone\nconversation into a stream of binary 1's and 0's, which enables the\ncalls to be greatly compressed and several calls to travel along\nthe same radio channel. So per-minute charges are generally\ncheaper.\n\n   And because a caller's voice is turned into digital codes while\ntraveling along the radio waves, it's impossible to eavesdrop on\nthe conversation.\n\n   Reports of analog's imminent demise are not exaggerated. And\nwireless phone executives aren't looking back. Their heavily\npromoted cutting-edge products all depend on digital services,\nincluding smart-phone devices with Internet access, as well as\nnovel ways of sending and receiving e-mail.\n\n   For business users, companies are also on the brink of rolling\nout ways in which you can use your wireless phone for high-speed\ndata transmissions.\n\n   These executives are ecstatic about the idea that a digital\nphone could provide everyday access to the Internet or allow one to\nsend lengthy memos.\n\n   They can just see the cell-phone meter running and the dimes\ndropping in.\n\n   Analog will probably just fade away through attrition, as\ndigital plans start to be more competitive on price and carriers\nrefuse to sign on new analog customers.\n\n   As of this summer, AT&T Wireless will no longer offer analog\nservice to new subscribers in New York and some other cities where\nsuch service has been available, according to David Stanley-Brown,\nnational director of advanced services for AT&T Wireless. (AT&T\nWireless in Boston has always been digital.)\n\n   Some analysts say, however, that analog service, not the phones\nthemselves, may have some staying power. They argue that carriers\nwill be loathe to spend money to build extensive digital networks\nin small, rural areas where analog now operates. Digital phones,\nthey say, will continue to have the option of roaming onto analog\nin areas where digital doesn't have service yet.\n\n   ``Carriers can't get rid of analog now,'' says Kent Olson,\ndirector of the Strategis Group, a telecommunications consulting\ngroup in Washington. ``That's where the coverage is.''\n\n   It's unclear what the next generation of digital phones will\nlook like.
