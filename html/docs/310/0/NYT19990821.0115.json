Although no physical evidence implicated Burrows, two\nwitnesses testified against him. One later recanted to a newspaper,\nclaiming coercion by prosecutors and the police. The other witness\nconfessed to the crime.\n\n   Gary Gauger\n\n   Convicted: 1993\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: The murder of his parents in Illinois. At his arrest\nGauger was interrogated for more than 16 hours without a lawyer.\nAsked to describe how he might have committed the murders, Gauger\ncomplied; his answer was construed as a confession. The same judge\nwho sentenced him to death later overturned the conviction, finding\nlittle evidence to arrest Gauger in the first place. Last year, a\ngang member, on trial for several unrelated crimes, confessed to\nmurdering Gauger's parents, with an accomplice.\n\n   QUESTIONS OF EVIDENCE\n\n   Gary Nelson\n\n   Convicted: 1980\n\n   Released: 1991\n\n   Crime: The rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl in Georgia. The\nprosecution presented an 8-year-old eyewitness and hair and semen\nsamples. A volunteer group of lawyers later uncovered large amounts\nof suppressed evidence, including FBI tests showing that the\nsamples belonged to a white man. (Nelson is black.)\n\n   John C. Skelton\n\n   Convicted: 1983\n\n   Released: 1990\n\n   Crime: Killing a former employee, Joe Neal, in Texas by rigging\nhis pickup truck with dynamite. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nsaid the prosecution had failed to link Skelton to the crime.\n\n   Curtis Lee Kyles\n\n   Convicted: 1984\n\n   Released: 1998\n\n   Crime: The murder of Dolores Dye during a car theft in\nLouisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Kyles'\nconviction, ruled that the prosecution had withheld material\nevidence regarding a paid informant who said Kyles, an\nacquaintance, was the murderer. The informant had previously been\nsuspected of the murder.\n\n   Adolph Munson\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1995\n\n   Crime: The kidnapping and murder of a store clerk in Oklahoma\nwhile Munson was on work release after serving time for a 1964\nmurder. After nine years of appeals and an investigative report by\nthe American Bar Association, the state's highest criminal appeals\ncourt overturned his conviction, finding that Oklahoma prosecutors\nhad suppressed evidence that supported Munson's innocence,\nincluding the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the murderer\nwas white. (Munson is black.) He was acquitted in retrial.\n\n   Jay C. Smith\n\n   Convicted: 1986\n\n   Released: 1992\n\n   Crime: The 1979 murder of a teacher and her two children in\nPennsylvania; the prosecution charged that Smith, a principal,\nacted with the victim's fiance, who was later sentenced to three\nlife terms. In 1989, the conviction was reversed because of hearsay\nevidence and because the prosecution was found to have suppressed\nevidence that strongly implicated the fiance as the lone murderer.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that the prosecution had\nviolated all principles of justice and fairness.\n\n   Bradley P. Scott\n\n   Convicted: 1988\n\n   Released: 1991\n\n   Crime: Murdering a woman friend in 1978 in Florida. The document\nstating his whereabouts at the time of the crime had been\nmisplaced; the police claimed to have an eyewitness who placed\nScott at the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the\nevidence to be insufficient.\n\n   Sabrina Butler\n\n   Convicted: 1990\n\n   Released: 1995\n\n   Crime: Killing her 9-month-old son, Walter, in Mississippi.\nButler said the baby stopped breathing and she tried to resuscitate\nhim before taking him to a hospital. She was later acquitted when a\nneighbor, who did not testify at the original trial, substantiated\nher story. Tests on the child's exhumed body pointed to kidney\ndisease as a cause of death.\n\n   Andrew Golden\n\n   Convicted: 1991\n\n   Released: 1994\n\n   Crime: Drowning his wife in Florida. Though the death was\ninitially ruled accidental, Golden was later tried and found\nguilty. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court said the state failed\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Golden's death\nresulted from the criminal agency of another person rather than by\naccident.\n\n   Randall Padgett\n\n   Convicted: 1992\n\n   Released: 1997\n\n   Crime: The stabbing death of his estranged wife in Alabama. His\nconviction was based almost entirely on blood samples left at the\nscene, which were tested for DNA. It was later discovered that the\nFBI crime lab had determined that the blood was not Padgett's, but\nAlabama prosecutors had suppressed that fact. Padgett was acquitted\nat a retrial.\n\n   WRONG DNA\n\n   Rolando Cruz\n\n   Alejandro Hernandez\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: The 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico\nin Illinois. The men, who knew one another, were jointly tried,\nconvicted and sentenced to death. They won a new trial after the\nstate Supreme Court ruled that they should have been tried\nseparately. After the second trial they were convicted again, with\nHernandez getting 80 years. DNA tests in 1994 implicated a\nconvicted sex offender, Brian Dugan, who, during a plea bargain,\nconfessed to six murders, including Jeanine Nicarico's.\n\n   Kirk Bloodsworth\n\n   Convicted: 1984\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: The 1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old girl in Maryland.\nBloodsworth resembled the composite sketch of the suspect; police\nsaid he gave information about the crime. The first conviction was\nreversed because the prosecution withheld psychiatric evidence, but\nhe was convicted again in 1986, all the while pleading his\ninnocence. ``If I'm dead, that's it,'' he told the judge at that\ntime. ``You can't bring me back.'' In 1993 DNA from the scene was\nfound not to match Bloodsworth's.\n\n   Verneal Jimerson\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Dennis Williams\n\n   Convicted: 1979\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: The 1978 abduction, torture and murder of a couple in a\nsuburb of Chicago. The case against them and two others relied\nheavily on eyewitness testimony by one witness, Paula Gray, who\nchanged her testimony several times, at one point admitting that\nshe had implicated all four men in exchange for leniency in a\ndifferent case against her. DNA samples failed to match the four\nmen but implicated another man who later confessed to the crime.\n\n   Ronald Williamson\n\n   Convicted: 1988\n\n   Released: 1999\n\n   Crime: Raping, strangling and mutilating a 21-year-old waitress,\nDebra Sue Carter, in Oklahoma in 1982. The conviction was based\nlargely on strands of hair left at the crime scene and the\ntestimony of a witness, Glenn Gore. In 1997, DNA samples from semen\nfound at the crime scene were tested and found to match Gore's.\n\n   Robert Lee Miller Jr.\n\n   Convicted: 1988\n\n   Released: 1998\n\n   Crime: The rape and asphyxiation of two women, Anne Laura\nFowler, 83, and Zelma Cutler, 92, in Oklahoma in 1988. A judge\ndismissed the case after 10 years, saying the evidence was\ninsufficient. DNA in a semen sample did not match Miller's DNA, but\ndid match that of an already-convicted rapist.\n\n   Ronald Jones\n\n   Convicted: 1989\n\n   Charges dropped: 1999\n\n   Crime: The 1985 rape and murder of Debra Smith in Illinois.\nJones signed a confession that stated that Ms. Smith had agreed to\nhave sex with him for $10, then attacked him with a knife when he\nrefused to pay her and was killed in the struggle. In the first\ntrial, it was shown that Ms. Smith had no history of prostitution;\nJones later said the police had beaten him. But it was not until\n1997 that DNA tests used on the semen sample recovered at the crime\nscene proved that Jones was the wrong man. The charges against him,\nhowever, weren't dropped until May 1999 after prosecutors decided\nagainst a new trial. He remains in jail on unrelated charges.\n\n   Robert Hayes\n\n   Convicted: 1991\n\n   Released: 1997\n\n   Crime: The rape and murder of a co-worker in Florida. Hayes was\nconvicted largely from DNA evidence that was taken from hair found\nin the victim's hands. In 1995, the Florida Supreme Court\noverturned Hayes' conviction when it was revealed that the hair was\nfrom a white man; Hayes is black.\n\n   Sources: Death Penalty Information Center; National Coalition to\nAbolish the Death Penalty; American Bar Association; Amnesty\nInternational; The Center for Wrongful Convictions and the Death\nPenalty, Northwestern University; MacArthur Justice Center;\nNational Institute of Justice; Death Penalty Symposium: Prisoners\nReleased From Death Rows Since 1970 Because of Doubts About Their\nGuilt, by Michael L.
