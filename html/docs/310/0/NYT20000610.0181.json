Times News Service   \n\n   HOBOKEN, N.J. _ Most people here will tell you that not much is\ndifferent since the mayor got cancer.\n\n   The mayor, Anthony Russo, a feisty 53-year-old former\nschoolteacher who has ruled this bustling city of 35,000 across the\nriver from New York City since 1993, may be bald. (In typically\naggressive style, he shaved his head before his hair could fall\nout.) But he has not slowed down appreciably.\n\n   He signs orders, yells at his opponents on the city council and\ncontinues negotiations to fix up the once-crumbling waterfront,\nwhich has sprouted two lovely parks and an apartment complex during\nhis tenure. He accused some officials who sent him get-well cards\nof doing so out of guilt rather than concern.\n\n   But to the extent that the civic climate has changed at all\nsince late March, when Russo announced that he had just had surgery\nto remove a brain tumor the size of a golf ball, there is\nconsiderable disagreement about what, exactly, has happened. This\nis not surprising. Beneath Hoboken's ceaseless waves of\ngentrification lurks an old world where political grudges are\nnursed like kittens and shifting allegiances are monitored more\nclosely than the Nasdaq.\n\n   Russo's most devoted adversary on the City Council, Tony Soares,\nsaid the mayor had mellowed a little. ``I think he's a little more\napproachable now,'' Soares said recently. ``As much of a tyrant as\nhe's been all these years, you can't help but be sympathetic.''\n\n   Seconds later, though, he reversed himself. ``As much as you\nwant to be respectful to him,'' Soares said, ``he forces you into\nconfrontations.''\n\n   Margie O'Brien, a crossing guard in the city for more than 30\nyears and the author of several books on Hoboken history, said that\nRusso's enemies had grown more vicious.\n\n   ``It's like the animal world,'' O'Brien, 56, said last week as\nshe waved a flock of children across 11th Street. ``If one goldfish\nis weak, the other goldfish go after him.''\n\n   Like other events in Hoboken's fractious public life, the\nmayor's handling of his health problem is viewed in some quarters\nas part of a vast conspiracy. The mayor, some say, fabricated his\nentire illness to help his wife, Michele, win a seat on the school\nboard in April. Similarly, cynics contend, the mayor, a\ntwo-pack-a-day smoker for 40 years, started giving tearful\nantitobacco lectures in the public schools shortly before the\nelection to garner votes for Mrs. Russo. The mayor scoffs at such\nnotions.\n\n   Many have pointed out that while Russo has held a series of news\nconferences to update Hobokenites on his cancer, Ruben Ramos, 26,\nan opponent of Russo's on the council who has Hodgkin's disease,\nhas sought little publicity for his plight.\n\n   For Russo, of course, life has changed utterly. Like his\ncounterpart across the Hudson, another get-things-done\nItalian-American mayor who brooks little dissent and has a weakness\nfor mob movies ( Russo played a Mafioso's bodyguard in ``Analyze\nThis''), Russo says that cancer has rearranged his priorities.\n\n   ``I've become more pensive, more God-fearing, more God-loving,''\nRusso said in his office on the second floor of City Hall the other\nday. ``Maybe before I was looking for the glitz and the glitter. I\nwould go out after government events and I would have a few drinks\nand flirt. And maybe this made me realize how important family is\nto me. My personal future and my family's future, not my political\nfuture, are what's important.''\n\n   On Wednesday, the mayor was tired. He had gone in for some tests\nthe day before and he had not received the results as he had\nexpected.\n\n   ``I sit and think,'' he said. ``It's constantly on my mind.''\n\n   He didn't come in to work until 4 in the afternoon, and he made\nhis entrance at the 7 p.m. council meeting 15 minutes late. His\ndark blue blazer made the folds of his naked head look pale. He\ntook his usual spot, leaning on the railing that separates the\naudience from the council, and scowled.\n\n   Then, just after it was announced that Russo had appointed a\ncommissioner, Jean Rodriguez, to the city's public housing\nauthority, chaos erupted. Ramos said that the mayor had said in\nApril that his administration would consult with tenants of public\nhousing before making any new appointments.\n\n   ``I did not say that,'' Russo said.\n\n   ``You said you would meet with the residents,'' Ramos repeated.\n``That's what you said, yes.''\n\n   ``No, it is not.''\n\n   ``Yes, it is.''\n\n   Several others joined the fray. Russo accused Ramos, whose ward\ncontains most of the city's public housing, of being lax in his\nduties. Ramos, who took several months off to fight Hodgkin's, took\noffense. The council president, Nellie Moyeno, banged her gavel\nuntil the room echoed like a construction site.\n\n   Eventually things calmed down. Rodriguez, beaming, was sworn in\nand accepted hugs or kisses from all nine council members,\nincluding Ramos.\n\n   A few minutes later, though, Russo got into a shouting match\nwith the head of the public housing tenants' association, Linda\nWalker, who was also upset at not being consulted on Rodriguez's\nappointment.\n\n   ``This is ab-so-lute-ly pos-i-tive-ly wrong!'' Walker boomed.\nFor the mayor to hold a meeting on the eve of the school board\nelection and make promises to the residents of public housing just\nto get their votes to put his wife in office, she said, then to\njust disregard that promise __\n\n   ``Every promise I ever made in the seven years that I've been\nmayor has been kept, Linda!'' Russo yelled, nearly drowning her out\neven though she had the microphone.\n\n   For good measure, he accused Walker of being on the payroll of\none of his archrivals.\n\n   Afterward, Walker said that cancer had indeed changed Russo.\n\n   ``He's gone straight to the devil,'' she said. ``As far as\nmaking amends and trying to make sure he doesn't land on a\npitchfork when he goes, forget it. He's worse.''\n\n   Up in his office, Russo basked in the afterglow of his\noutbursts.\n\n   ``It was like a reprieve for me,'' he said. ``There was a little\naction. It got my mind off things.''\n\n   On Thursday, the test results came in. There was no active\ncancer anywhere. Even the nodules in his lungs, where doctors\nbelieved the cancer started, were benign, though Russo has been\ndirected to have one-third of his right lung removed just to be\nsafe.\n\n   Russo was ecstatic and grateful.\n\n   The news was greeted in the true Hoboken spirit.\n\n   ``Have you seen the tests?'' asked a skeptical member of the\nopposing camp. ``Some people believe that he's just announcing this\nto keep his troops from starting to rally against him.\n\n   ``And another thing.
