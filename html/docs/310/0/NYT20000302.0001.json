Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ Brandishing medical textbooks and x-rays, his voice\nchoked with anguish, the Staten Island neurosurgeon accused by the\nState Department of Health of operating on the wrong side of a\npatient's brain and other medical blunders Wednesday night\nvehemently denied nearly every allegation made by the department.\n\n   In a lengthy interview in a Manhattan coffee shop, Dr. Ehud\nArbit, accompanied by his wife and lawyer, categorically denied\nthat he committed any of the medical errors cited in a State Health\nDepartment report issued on Monday. He contended that he is the\ntarget of a few disgruntled hospital workers who have systemically\ntried to destroy his career for reasons he said he cannot fathom.\n\n   ``The atmosphere in our hospital is so poisonous,'' said Arbit,\na thin, soft-spoken man, ``and this kind of malicious behavior has\nbeen exercised not only against me but other doctors as well.''\n\n   He added: ``In my opinion, there were no aberrations in any of\nthese operations.''\n\n   On Monday, the state cited Staten Island University Hospital for\n40 violations and fined it $80,000 for failing to monitor Arbit.\nThe fine was the stiffest imposed on a hospital in the state in 15\nyears.\n\n   The state issued its report after interviewing various hospital\nworkers, outlining five operations that were performed by Arbit\nwhere its investigators concluded serious medical errors were made.\n\n   In the most serious case, according to the report, state\ninvestigators found that Arbit failed to take CAT scans into the\noperating room where a 54-year-old patient with brain and lung\ntumors awaited surgery. The report states that as a result, Arbit\nmade an incision on the left cerebellum, only to be told by a\nphysician's assistant that she recalled that the tumor was on the\nright side. The report goes on to say that Arbit told the\nphysician's assistant that he did not see a tumor on the left side,\nso he decided to proceed with his work on the right.\n\n   ``This is an outrageous lie,'' Arbit said, denying any\nconversation of the sort with the assistant.\n\n   Pointing to the X-ray of the patient, Johnnie Artis, a Staten\nIsland security guard who died a few days after his operation,\nArbit said that the tumor area covered both sides of the brain, and\nadded that he had created a sort of door on the back of the\npatient's head in which the point of entry was not relevant. To\nbuttress his point, he referred to a neurology textbook that shows\nthe procedure as he says it was performed.\n\n   In another case, a 21-year-old patient with a brain tumor was\nleft to bleed excessively, the state said. The doctor switched from\nperforming a biopsy, which was not proving effective, to brain\nsurgery, catching other staff members off guard and ill prepared.\nBecause the anesthesiologist had not anticipated more than a\nbiopsy, he had not prepared to replace large quantities of blood,\nthe report said. Arbit countered that he was only an assistant in\nthe procedure, called in at the last minute by another doctor who\nwas foundering, and that the bleeding was in fact not excessive.\n\n   A third case involved a patient requiring spinal surgery. An\nanesthesiologist and a physician's assistant told Health Department\ninvestigators that Arbit's hand slipped and lacerated the patient's\nspinal cord, leaving her partly paralyzed, a charge that\nparticularly outraged Arbit and his wife, Dr. Rose Varon, who put\nher head in her hands when discussing the charge.\n\n   Not only was the patient not paralyzed, but he did not sever her\ncord, Arbit said, and had he done so in that particular type of\nsurgery, it would have been medically impossible for her to be\nparalyzed. ``There was some pressure on the spinal cord,'' he said.\n``I never slipped. There was no laceration.''\n\n   In another instance, the state found that the doctor and his\nstaff failed to perform the proper follow-up blood work on a\n62-year-old patient, which Arbit said was also unfounded.\n\n   In the final case, state investigators said that a patient\ncomplained of weakness in her hands after an operation. A CAT scan\nrevealed loose screws on a plate that had been implanted in the\npatient's spine along the back of the neck, the state noted. Arbit\nfailed to replace the screws properly, the state said, at one point\nasking a representative from a medical equipment company his\nopinion on whether he thought the plate was positioned correctly.\n\n   While Arbit said that a screw had indeed come lose, he insisted\nthat he corrected the problem easily and that the patient was no\nworse for wear. ``I totally deny asking the assistance of this\ngentleman,'' he said in reference to the medical representative,\nwho are commonly present during operations as technical support.\n\n   Arbit said Wednesday night that a physician's assistant and at\nleast one anesthesiologist have been complaining about him, without\nmerit, to hospital administrators ever since he arrived at the\nhospital.
