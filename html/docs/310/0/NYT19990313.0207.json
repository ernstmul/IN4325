The Event\nRelated Optical Signal (EROS) scanner is uniquely capable of\npinpointing where and when brain activity occurs.\n\n   ``We're on the verge of actually understanding how the brain as\na whole works,'' said Ed Maclin, an MU research psychologist.\n\n   The researchers hope to use EROS and more conventional\ntechnology to learn not only how a normal brain works, but also to\ndiscover the sources of the many disorders that plague the mind.\n\n   ``It's hard to fight an enemy (mental illness) you can't see,''\nMU psychologist Steve Hackley said. ``This will make it as easy to\nsee sickness in the mind as it is to see a broken bone in the\nbody.''\n\n   Although practical applications for patients are still far in\nthe future, the research, which involves dozens of researchers\ncollaborating at the two universities, may eventually yield many\nmedical benefits. For example, the technology may one day make it\npossible to:\n\n   - Locate crucial areas of language and memory that a surgeon\nshould avoid in brain surgery.\n\n   - Determine the exact causes of a learning or attention deficit\ndisorder in children so that the most appropriate treatment is\ngiven.\n\n   - Diagnose whether newly noticed forgetfulness is early\nAlzheimer's disease or normal aging.\n\n   Researchers at several other universities in the United States\nand abroad also are working on EROS technology. The researchers in\nColumbia on Friday called EROS a major advance because it allows\nthem to see how a stimulus, such as a sound or a picture on a\ncomputer screen, triggers a sequence of events in the brain.\n\n   The EROS computer produces a map of the brain that flashes in\nbright reds and yellows on a computer screen when a portion of the\nbrain is activated.\n\n   ``By knowing how a sequence lights up you really get a glimpse\nabout how thinking works,'' MU psychologist Monica Fabiani said.\n\n   Scans by magnetic resonance imaging, like those done in\nhospitals, produce the clearest anatomical images of the interior\nof the brain. And a special MRI technique called functional MRI, or\nfMRI, can locate brain activity by revealing parts of the brain\nwhere blood circulation increases.\n\n   But fMRI doesn't have the speed required to follow quick shifts\nin brain activity. That's because the surge in blood flow the fMRI\ndetects may take 10 or 12 seconds, far longer than the instant it\ntakes the eye to send an image to the brain.\n\n   EROS scans measure the actual activity of nerve cells and can\nmake images of what occurs in a thousandth of a second.\n\n   That permits scientists to see split-second shifts in the\nlocation of brain activity, such as the rapid firing of neurons\nduring an epileptic seizure.\n\n   EROS subjects wear a motorcycle helmet with hundreds of holes\ndrilled through. Depending on which parts of the brain the\nresearchers want to study, they insert fiber optic cables into the\nhelmet holes. A laser shines infrared light through the cables. The\nlight is at a frequency that is not readily absorbed by brain\ntissue so that the brain is somewhat transparent and lets some of\nthe light through.\n\n   ``We're bouncing light through the brain. This is `Star\nTrek'-like technology,'' Washington University researcher Randy\nBuckner said.\n\n   When neurons in the brain are activated, they become more\ntransparent to the EROS laser light. The light then travels farther\nthrough the brain.\n\n   Light reflected off brain tissue is picked up by other helmet\ncables attached to sensors. A computer then gauges time and\nlocation of brain activity.\n\n   Fabiani said she is about to begin an EROS study on the effect\nof aging on memory. By next year, there may be other studies\ninvolving children, she said.\n\n   Researchers also have used a computer to superimpose the EROS\nimages onto the clearer brain images made by MRI. This creates\nrevealing pictures of the brain in action.\n\n   ``The combination of technologies is the future'' of brain\nresearch, said Gabriele Gratton, an MU psychologist.\n\n   While MU and Washington University have been collaborating\ninformally on brain imaging research, researchers at the two\nschools hope to create a joint research center, Gratton said.\nWashington University is a recognized leader in fMRI research,\nwhile MU has made the greatest advances in EROS, he said.\n\n   The idea of a collaborative research center has received\ntentative approval from administrators on both campuses, Gratton\nsaid.
