George W. Bush at a press\nconference announcing the event.\n\n   The use of the database as an investigative tool could usher in\na whole new era of crime detection and prosecution, officials say.\nBut the use of DNA _ the distinct genetic blueprint found in human\ncells _ as the sole piece of evidence to catch criminals is in its\ninfancy in Texas, and it may be awhile before it becomes\ncommonplace.\n\n   In 1995, the Legislature passed a law requiring anyone convicted\nof or serving time for a sex offense in Texas to submit a blood\nsample. The blood samples are sent to the Texas Department of\nPublic Safety's laboratory in Austin, where DNA information is\nanalyzed and entered into a database.\n\n   When a sex offense is committed, law officers collect evidence\nfrom the crime scene and alert DPS laboratory officials, who\ncompare the existing DNA information from the blood samples with\ncrime scene evidence. A so-called cold hit occurs when the DNA of a\nperson who is not a suspect in a particular crime is matched with\nDNA from the scene of that crime.\n\n   The Texas database, which has 7,500 DNA profiles and 7,000 blood\nsamples waiting to be analyzed, is one cog in a national program\ncalled CODIS, or Combined DNA Index System. As of August 1997,\n35states had databases. All 50 states have legislation in place to\ncreate them.\n\n   Federal and state money pays for the program, which costs\napproximately $600,000 to $700,000, though that figure could rise\nas the database grows.\n\n   CODIS, administered through the FBI, can be accessed by law\nenforcement officials to search for matches, even in cases where\nthere are no suspects.\n\n   Such was the case with the assaults of the two young girls in\nGranbury, 35 miles southwest of Fort Worth. The sisters, ages 10\nand 11, were each sexually assaulted in a dry creek bed near their\nhome while the other was forced to watch, according to Detective\nBruce Espin of the Granbury Police Department.\n\n   The only evidence law enforcement officials had to go on was\nsome semen collected from the victims' clothing. At the time, it\nwas not enough to charge anyone with the crime.\n\n   Five years later, Lester Don Parks, 41, of Coleman, has been\ncharged with two counts of sexual assault with a deadly weapon.\n\n   Authorities had taken a sample of Parks' blood after he was\nconvicted of a 1995 sexual assault. They compared the sample with\nDNA evidence from the 1993 Granbury case.\n\n   Officials said Parks confessed to the assaults after the DNA\nevidence was presented to him.\n\n   Using the CODIS software, officials across the nation have made\nmore than 200 cold hits, said Steve Niezgoda, CODIS program manager\nfor the FBI. As more states get their databases up and running,\nthat number should climb substantially, he said.\n\n   Texas began compiling its DNA database in January 1996. Virginia\nstarted its database in 1989 and has collected more than 170,000\nblood samples. But only about 11,000 samples have been analyzed,\nsaid Dr. Paul Ferrara, director of Virginia's Division of\nForensics, which manages the state's database.\n\n   Like Texas, Virginia started out sampling only violent sex\noffenders for placement in the database. It has now been expanded\nto include all convicted felons and juveniles 14 or older who\ncommit the equivalent of a felony. Texas officials say the same\ncould eventually occur here.\n\n   Last year, there were more than 8,000 reported rapes in Texas,\naccording to the DPS crime reporting division.\n\n   ``These databanks are revolutionizing criminal investigations,''\nFerrara said. ``Not only do you have the capability of confirming\nthat a suspect did or did not commit a crime, you have the\nresources to run the DNA profiles from crime scenes where the\npolice don't have suspects.''\n\n   A positive DNA match does not seal a suspect's fate, Ferrara\nsaid, but it does help prosecutors during trial.\n\n   ``Like in any DNA case, it becomes strong evidence,'' he said.\n``Because it is such powerful evidence, a lot of time is spent\nattempting to attack it.''\n\n   In some cases, DNA evidence has been used to clear people of\ncrimes.\n\n   Ben Salazar of Garfield, outside Austin, was convicted in 1992\nof raping a pregnant Austin woman and was serving a 30-year\nsentence when DNA tests exonerated him of the crime last year.\n\n   The technology, like any other form of evidence gathering, is\nsubject to legal challenge, Ferrara said. Virginia's database law\nwas challenged in 1990, when opponents contended that the taking of\nblood samples was a form of illegal search and seizure and violated\na felon's right to privacy.\n\n   But Ferrara said the law was upheld and DNA evidence has never\nbeen seriously challenged in a courtroom.\n\n   ``We have never experienced a situation where the accuracy and\nthe reliability of DNA evidence was in question,'' he said.\n``That's one of the beauties of DNA collection and analysis. It's\nbased in hard science that has been accepted and endorsed by the\nscientific community. It's objective and the results are beyond\ndispute.''\n\n   But even reliable science is prone to human error.\n\n   ``Forensic laboratories are only as good as the quality of\nevidence that they get. Where humans are involved, nothing is\nabsolute,'' Ferrara said.\n\n   Assuming the collection and analyzing of blood samples and\ncrime-scene evidence go smoothly, the chances of linking the wrong\nperson to a crime are close to zero, said Dr. Dennis Loockerman,\nCODIS lab supervisor with the DPS.\n\n   The odds are ``about one in 72 billion,'' Loockerman said.\n\n   The lab tests nine different locations on the genetic strand.\nFor a positive link, those nine areas must match up on crime scene\nDNA and blood samples, he said.\n\n   Matches will become more routine as databases get larger and are\nin place for longer periods of time, Ferrara said. But more\nresources and personnel could help get the job done faster, he\nadded.\n\n   ``Because of backlogs, we've been making hits on crimes that are\na year or 2 or 5 or 8 years old,'' Ferrara said. ``It gives you\npause to think, if we had done testing immediately upon receipt of\nsamples, how many less victims would there be?''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the first time in Texas, law enforcement\nofficials have used a high-tech DNA database to positively link a\nperson to a crime where the only evidence available was DNA from\nthe crime scene, state officials announced.\n","\n   A Texas man has been charged with the sexual assaults of two\nyoung North Texas girls in 1993, a case in which he had not been a\nsuspect.\n","\n   ``We now have a DNA database that proverbially allows us to find\nthe needle in the haystack,'' said Gov.
