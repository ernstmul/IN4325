Wednesday's craniotomy was to remove the largest tumor from\nher brain, which was causing headaches, dizziness and other\nsymptoms.\n\n   Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of the department of neurosurgery,\nsaid the tumor was close to the part of the brain that controls\nfunctions on the right side of Perrot's body.\n\n   ``This raised the bar to some extent, and the concern doing the\nsurgery was we might be affecting that,'' he said. ``It was a\ndelicate surgery because of the location of the tumor. But I was\nvery pleased with how it turned out. One of my greatest fears\nbecause of who she is and her professional accomplishments is that\nwe wouldn't want her to lose any strength in her right hand.''\n\n   Dr. Ritsuko Komaki, a radiation oncologist who will oversee\nPerrot's treatments, said Perrot's excellent health improves her\nchances of beating the disease.\n\n   ``I do not expect any problems going into radiation therapy,''\nshe said. ``I would like to take care of whatever is left over,\nwhich are very small spots. I'm confident we can get rid of the\nsmall spots in her brain.''\n\n   Though the first, and perhaps most difficult step, is behind\nher, Perrot's path to recovery will be long. She will begin 2 1/2\nweeks of radiation treatments in about a week to remove several\nsmaller tumors on her brain. She will then undergo six months of\nchemotherapy treatments to remove multiple lesions on her lungs,\nwhich is where the cancer originated.\n\n   ``The first part of the journey was very successful,'' Perrot\nsaid. ``I'm on my way to the second step, and it's going to be a\nstruggle. But I feel strong and ready to take on the next step.''\n\n   Perrot appeared in good spirits as she left the Houston hospital\nwith several family members, including her mother. Perrot opened\nand closed her right fist to show reporters she had lost no\nstrength.\n\n   Perrot will receive one radiation treatment a day, five days a\nweek for 2 1/2 weeks. Komaki said the treatments will be done on an\noutpatient basis and will take ``only a couple of minutes'' and\nwill not make her sick. During this time, Perrot will take steroids\nto reduce the swelling in her brain.\n\n   Perrot said that although her recovery is the primary issue with\nher, she wants to resume her basketball career at some point.\n\n   ``It's something I've done all my life,'' she said. ``The fact\nthat all that can be taken away is kind of difficult. But I have\nfaith in God and the best doctors in the world and work for a great\norganization. I know that I'm going to be back on the court one\nday.''\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nHOUSTON COMETS GUARD GOES HOME AFTER SUCCESSFUL SURGERY \n\n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ Kim Perrot walked gingerly into a room full of\nreporters whom she greeted with a familiar smile.\n","\n   ``I see you guys made it back,'' she said. ``I know you weren't\nexpecting me to be back, but I'm here.''\n","\n   But anyone who has seen the Comets 5-5 point guard play\nbasketball would have been foolish to believe Perrot would let a\nbattle with brain and lung cancer keep her off her feet, much less\nin the hospital.\n","\n   Perrot, dressed in a black and yellow warm-up suit and a Comets\nWNBA championship cap, left the University of Texas M.D. Anderson\nCancer Center on Sunday just four days after doctors removed a\ngolf-ball-sized tumor from her brain.\n","\n   ``I want to thank God for getting me through this,'' Perrot\nsaid. ``Secondly, I want to thank my family and people around the\nworld who supported me.''\n","\n   Perrot, 32, announced Feb. 22 she was suffering from alveolar\nadenocarcinoma, a cancer that starts in the lungs but spread to her\nbrain.
