Times News Service    \n\n   One evening last summer, Jonah M. came to see me at my clinic.\nBecause he had a walk-in appointment, I figured he had a minor\nproblem _ maybe a sore throat, a sprained ankle _ that I could help\nhim with right away. When he sat in my examination room, his face\nwas flushed. ``I have a lump on my testicle,'' he announced.\n\n   He was 29, handsome, with unruly brown hair, hazel eyes and a\nnervous earnestness that was instantly likable. He had a kind of\nCalifornia surfer drawl that bespoke nonchalance, but his darting\nglances and stammer betrayed his anxiety. The lump was about the\nsize of a pea, he said. It didn't hurt. He had noticed it only the\nnight before.\n\n   I was immediately concerned. A painless testicular mass, if\nindeed it arises from the testicle, is almost always cancer. (A\nscrotal mass can turn out to be a varicocele, or benign dilated\nveins.) Of course, testicular cancer isn't always a painless\ntesticular mass. Sometimes it is a painful lump or tender swelling.\nOften it is confused with epididymitis, an inflammation of the\ntubules that ferry sperm out of the testis, or orchitis, which is\nthe generalized inflammation of the testes, usually from an\ninfection.\n\n   While talking with Jonah, I remembered another patient: His\ndisease had been misdiagnosed for months as epididymitis, before an\nultrasound found cancer. By then, it had spread to his brain and\nlungs.\n\n   For Jonah, an exam turned up nothing out of the ordinary other\nthan the lump, which was round, rubbery and about half an inch in\ndiameter. Though I had almost no experience with testicular cancer,\nI knew this was serious.\n\n   ``What do you think?'' Jonah asked.\n\n   I wasn't sure what to say. ``I'm not sure,'' I replied. ``It may\nbe nothing. Let me consult with another doctor.''\n\n   As a medical resident, I went to my supervisor. Concerned, she\ncame with me to examine it. Later, in her office, we discussed what\nto do. ``It's probably cancer,'' she said.``He needs an ultrasound\nto confirm it.'' Though excited by my discovery, I was saddened by\nthe burden I was about to lay on Jonah. ``Good pickup,'' she said,\naware of my feelings. ``You caught it early. He can probably be\ncured.''\n\n   When I got back to my exam room 15 minutes later, Jonah was even\nmore on edge. ``What do I have?'' he asked. I decided not to burden\nhim unnecessarily with unconfirmed suspicions. ``I don't know,'' I\nreplied. ``We need more information. Can you come in tomorrow for\nan ultrasound?'' A wave of alarm washed over him. ``Do I have\ncancer?'' he whispered.\n\n   ``I just don't know at this point,'' I said. ``We need more\ninformation.''\n\n   Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor in men 15 to\n34. The incidence has been rising worldwide, and in the United\nStates 7,000 to 8,000 cases are diagnosed every year. The cause is\nunknown, though men with a history of viral infections or an\nundescended testicle seem more at risk.\n\n   Like most cancers, it used to be a death sentence; today, with\nadvances in chemotherapy, it has a cure rate of 90 percent. Even\npatients whose cancer has metastasized can usually be cured. (Just\nask Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who won the Tour de France three\nyears after debilitating chemotherapy for metastatic testicular\ncancer.) Still, it's a frightening diagnosis, not just because it's\ncancer, but because the primary treatment is one of the scariest\nthings a man can envision: removal of a testicle.\n\n   Jonah had his ultrasound the next morning. By 5, the urology\nresident paged me. ``It's cancer,'' he said. The test showed a\nround, well-defined mass, about five-eighths of an inch in\ndiameter, on top of the right testicle. ``Have you told him?'' I\nasked. ``I'm about to,'' he replied.\n\n   Jonah later told me how he got the bad news. ``The resident just\nwalked right in with his team and told me,'' he said. ``He was very\ntake-charge and matter of fact. His attitude was, ``This is what\nyou have, and this is what we need to do about it.''\n\n   ``But it was sort of like _ boom! _ I wasn't expecting it. The\nscariest thing is how you can be just fine one minute, and the next\nhave someone tell you you have cancer and need to have your\ntesticle removed.''\n\n   Three days later, Jonah had an orchiectomy, the removal of a\ntesticle. He was out of the hospital that day, and though morphine\nand codeine relieved the pain, he said later that there was a far\nmore painful reality: ``That my body was not going to be the\nsame.''\n\n   His biggest fear after surgery was sexual inadequacy. Because an\norchiectomy often results in a drop in serum testosterone, he was\nwarned that he might need hormone replacement. He never did, and\nafter a few weeks, with the occasional help of Viagra, he resumed\nnormal sexual relations with his girlfriend.\n\n   After the operation, Jonah consulted a cancer specialist, who\ntold him that his kind of testicular cancer had about a 30 percent\nchance of recurrence and he had two options: dissection of the\nlymph nodes in his groin and abdomen for evidence of residual\ndisease, or ``watchful waiting,'' in which he would have blood\ntests and X-rays every month, as well as CAT scans every three\nmonths. He waited, and soon it will be a year since Jonah walked\ninto the clinic. So far, so good.\n\n   ``Sometimes, late at night, I lie awake thinking. Like, if I\ndon't move around, don't stir, it won't emerge again. Like if I\nmove around too much, I might awaken it. Like it's this beast,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   A beast, I agreed: asleep and scary, but one that can be killed.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nFROM A PEA-SIZED LUMP, YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY \n","Text":["\n   One evening last summer, Jonah M. came to see me at my clinic.\nBecause he had a walk-in appointment, I figured he had a minor\nproblem _ maybe a sore throat, a sprained ankle _ that I could help\nhim with right away.
