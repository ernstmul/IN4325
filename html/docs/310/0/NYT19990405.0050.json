Well, almost. The newly passed ordinance says it's a minor\nmisdemeanor for a driver to use a cell phone unless both hands are\non the wheel.  \n\n   The law makes an exception for ``emergencies,'' which I take to\nbe something more serious than needing to order pizza for your\nDow10K party. And the Solons of Brooklyn will let you use a car\nphone if the transmission is in ``park'' or if you use a\nspeakerphone.  \n\n   I do not know how many accidents car phones cause, but surely\nmore than they get blamed for. I do know that most drivers can't\neven drive and breathe at the same time without losing\nconcentration. Driving and telecommunicating is altogether beyond\nthe capacity of most humans to sustain safely.  \n\n   So I applaud the eminent good sense of the leaders of Brooklyn\nand I suggest this is a battle all people of good will should\njoin.  \n\n   It would be progress, in fact, if, as a start, we could simply\nget all the other Brooklyns in this country to adopt similar\nordinances. Besides the Brooklyn in Ohio _ and the one in New York\nI alluded to in the opening paragraph of this remarkably sensible\ncolumn _ you will find Brooklyns in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana,\nIowa, Maryland, Michigan and Mississippi, to say nothing of\nBrooklyn Center and Brooklyn Park, both in Minnesota.  \n\n   Well, you can find them if, that is, you know where to look for\nthem. Some of them _ like my essay on ``How Al Gore Invented the\nInternet'' _ don't take up much space.  \n\n   But while we're trying to spread the no-car-phones movement, I\nthink we should not neglect several other modern automobile\nhazards, annoyances and idiocies that need reform.  \n\n   For instance, is there no municipal statesperson anywhere in the\ncountry with the chutzpah and foresight to lead the drive for an\nordinance that would ban the playing of any car radio, tape deck or\nCD player that can be heard anywhere outside that very car?  \n\n   If the city council of my own community would adopt that\nordinance, I would speak kindly of its members for years. And the\nbest part is that my honorific words might actually be heard.  \n\n   Oh, and while we're banning various appliances and distracting\ncar devices, let's make it illegal for drivers to shave, apply\nmakeup or consume a six-course dinner while cruising the highways.\nPlease, people, the person you kill while edging your sideburns,\nlipsticking your mouth or devouring a leg of ram might be me. And I\nwould take a very dim view of such an outcome.  \n\n   Also, can we please get rid of stupid bumper stickers and\n``Knucklehead on Board'' signs that demand our attention as we come\nup behind or alongside other cars? We already have way too much\ninformation flowing our way from way too many sources. There is no\npublic demand at all for you to tell us via a bumper sticker what\nyour position is on Kosovo or nuclear waste.  \n\n   I'm happy you've developed a position on Kosovo. So have I. But\nif it can be contained on a bumper sticker, it's so amazingly\nmoronic and meaningless that you should not want to advertise and\nreveal its nincompoopness.  \n\n   In fact, if I see such an annoying bumper sticker on your car, I\nwill pull off the road, find a pay phone, ring your car phone and\ntell you how dumb it is. If you're stupid enough to answer while\ndriving, I win the point.  \n\n    \n\n   (Bill Tammeus is a columnist for The Kansas City Star.
