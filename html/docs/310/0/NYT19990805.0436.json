(rk) \n By DAVID BARBOZA   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   CHICAGO _ After a three-year study, medical investigators\nworking for the BP Amoco Corp. said Thursday that an unusually high\nincidence of a rare brain cancer among some employees at a research\ncenter near here was most likely work-related.\n\n   The investigators, who were hired from the University of Alabama\nand Johns Hopkins University, said that although the findings were\npreliminary and did not pinpoint a cause, the statistical evidence\nsuggested that ``occupational exposure'' might have affected six\nchemical researchers who in the last decade were found to have a\nrare and often deadly form of brain cancer called glioma. At the\nsame time, the investigators said they found no evidence that about\n13 other cases of nonglioma brain tumors were work-related.\n\n   Lawyers representing a large group of current and former\nemployees in lawsuits against the company criticized the\nconclusions Thursday, saying that the Amoco study was neither\nthorough nor independent.\n\n   ``This study was bought and paid for by Amoco; it's hardly an\nindependent study,'' said Tilden Katz, a spokesman for Corboy &\nDemetrio, a law firm in Chicago that is representing nonglioma\ncancer victims. ``We have clients who had brain tumors who were\nnever contacted by Amoco,'' Katz said.\n\n   Since 1989, about 19 people who had worked at the Amoco Research\nCenter in Naperville, Ill., a Chicago suburb, were found to have\nbrain tumors. Officials of Amoco, the giant oil company, say they\nhave been working vigorously to find a cause, but even medical\nexperts say that the major difficulty in resolving the case is that\nscience has not found a definitive cause of brain cancer in humans.\n\n   ``It's frustrating to spend three years studying something and\nnot to have a definitive answer,'' said Jim D. Lowry, the chairman\nof BP Amoco's health investigation task force. ``We are hopeful\nthat the clues the investigators have uncovered will in some way\nhelp health scientists in their efforts to identify the causes of\nbrain cancer.''\n\n   Of the 19 brain tumor victims who have been identified by Amoco,\ninvestigators say they have only found a pattern that would suggest\nwork-related causes among the six glioma victims, all of whom were\nlong-term chemical researchers often working on similar projects\nwith similar chemicals and in the same building. Amoco officials\nsaid the investigators do not believe the other brain tumors were\nwork-related.\n\n   There was no unusual pattern of workplace, time or common agents\nused by others who had inter-cranial tumors, the company said. Of\nthe six glioma victims, five have died. All 13 other brain tumor\nvictims are alive, the company said.\n\n   At a news conference in Naperville Thursday, members of a health\ntask force formed by Amoco in 1989 said the university researchers\n(who were not present at the news conference) had not identified a\nspecific cancer-causing agent, but they did find that two types of\nchemical agents, low-level ionizing radiation and a solvent called\nn-hexane, were used by the glioma victims.\n\n   Those agents, which are not believed to cause cancer, are\nprobably not the cause of the brain cancers, officials said. But\nthey may hold clues to the mysterious outbreak here, which surfaced\nin 1989. Amoco officials said both agents had been largely phased\nout at the Naperville Research Center, and that the solvent\nn-hexane is now little used because it is known to cause damage to\nnerves in the hands and feet. It is not a carcinogen and not known\nto damage the central nervous system, but it is toxic, Lowry said.\n\n   ``These two are not necessarily the cause but suspects,'' said\nMichael S. Wells, a health manager at BP Amoco. ``The investigators\ndo not believe they could be the cause.''\n\n   More than a dozen cancer victims _ mostly nonglioma _ have\njoined a series of lawsuits arguing that in the 1970s and 1980s\nAmoco knowingly exposed employees to toxic chemicals and unsafe\nconditions despite repeated complaints about faulty ventilation\nsystems and dangerous storage conditions. Amoco officials, however,\nhave said that those problems were fixed long ago and have been\nlargely ruled out as possible causes of the brain tumors.\n\n   Amoco officials say they will continue working with victims but\nhave not decided whether they will offer monetary compensation.\n``We're going to do the responsible thing,'' said Wells.\n\n   The company said it has spent millions of dollars over the past\nfew years trying to determine whether the brain tumors were\nwork-related.Thursday, members of the task force said they had long\nsuspected that the cause of some of the cancers was work-related\nand that they had known from earlier studies that the rate of\nglioma at the Naperville center was about eight times higher than\nthat of the general population.\n\n   The company said that all six of the glioma victims were\nchemical researchers who worked in the Naperville research center.\n","Headline":"\nRARE CANCER IN AMOCO EMPLOYEES IS PROBABLY WORK RELATED \n","Text":["\n   CHICAGO _ After a three-year study, medical investigators\nworking for the BP Amoco Corp. said Thursday that an unusually high\nincidence of a rare brain cancer among some employees at a research\ncenter near here was most likely work-related.\n","\n   The investigators, who were hired from the University of Alabama\nand Johns Hopkins University, said that although the findings were\npreliminary and did not pinpoint a cause, the statistical evidence\nsuggested that ``occupational exposure'' might have affected six\nchemical researchers who in the last decade were found to have a\nrare and often deadly form of brain cancer called glioma.
