But the\npontiff, 79, also relived his childhood, making a nostalgic and\nrestorative visit to his birthplace, Wadowice.\n\n   _ By ALESSANDRA STANLEY\n\n   Prime Time for Casino Ads\n\n   Gambling casinos have a product to market, and radio and\ntelevision stations are more than willing to sell them air time.\nBut a 65-year-old federal law made it illegal to broadcast\nadvertisements for casino gambling.\n\n   A unanimous Supreme Court decision declared the old law\nunconstitutional on First Amendment grounds, and riddled with\nexceptions and inconsistencies. Gambling advertising by\nIndian-owned casinos and by state lotteries, for example, was\npermitted.

The North Koreans\nlost a ship and more than 20 sailors. America, though, may have\nlost a chance to convince Congress that sanctions on the North\nshould be lifted in return for commitments from Pyongyang to give\nup their missile tests and other threatening programs.\n\n   _ By DAVID E. SANGER\n\n   Hold That Coke   \n\n   In the biggest recall in Coke history, four European countries\nordered Coca-Cola products off store shelves after dozens of people\nin Belgium fell ill after drinking Coke. By Friday, despite an\napology from Coca-Cola's chairman and an explanation that the\nproblem originated at two European bottling plants, a ban on Coke,\nSprite and Fanta remained in Belgium and Luxembourg. The\nNetherlands banned products handled in Belgium, and France demanded\na recall of beverages from a plant in Dunkirk blamed for some of\nthe incidents.\n\n   _ By CONSTANCE L. HAYS\n\n   No Magic Bullet for Cancer\n\n   In an international study that offered new hope for delaying the\nonset of breast cancer, risk of the disease was lowered by 76\npercent among postmenopausal women who took an osteoporosis drug,\nraloxifene, for three years compared to a similar group that took a\nplacebo. But because the duration of benefit is unknown and\nraloxifene can produce unwanted effects, experts cautioned against\nrecommending it as an anti-breast-cancer drug except in clinical\ntrials.\n\n   _ By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN\n\n   A New Indian Museum   \n\n   The Fine Arts Commission, the esthetic arbiter of the appearance\nof what can be built in Washington's monument area, unanimously\napproved the design of the Smithsonian Institution's new National\nMuseum of the American Indian. It will cost at least $110 million\nand is to open in 2002 on the last available site on the Mall. The\nmuseum's collection will include most of the holdings of the Heye\nFoundation in New York City.\n\n   Indians played a major role in the design of the limestone\nbuilding. The land surrounding the museum will include forest and\nwetland, and in the marshy area the cattails so essential to many\nIndian rituals will be grown.\n\n   ``I think it's fabulous,'' said Emily Malino Scheuer, a member\nof the Fine Arts Commission. ``It is a long overdue recognition of\nnative American culture.''\n\n   _ By IRVIN MOLOTSKY\n\n   GM and Ken Burns\n\n   That Ken Burns would continue to make well-received\ndocumentaries seems a safe bet.
