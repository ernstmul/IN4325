For hours at a time, Jennifer found herself\nalone with her mother and, at times, no food to eat. A family\ndoctor recommended Hospice of Dayton, and soon the agency's home\nhealth aides were there not only to care for Hughes but to make\nsure there was enough medical supplies and food in the home.\nHospice never charged the family a penny, but the agency must rely\non donations from the community to help families like Sandra's.\nOnce she saw that her daughters would be taken care of, Hughes\ndecided to let go, calling out to Jennifer one night to say\n``goodbye.''

The children of the movement _ the\noffspring of black militants, nonviolent activists and even\nsegregationist leaders _ are now adults. They have followed many\nroads in recent years. Some continue to carry on their parents'\nwork. Others want only to forget their childhood. Blake profiled\nnine of them.\n\n   The story is embargoed until Sunday, Sept. 10, but will move by\nFriday evening. PHOTOS are available.\n\n   Stories include:\n\n   CIVILRIGHTS-CHILDREN _ Ericka Brown-Abram thinks she had a\ntypical childhood. Her mother's friends were killed in police\nshootouts. Her family lived under FBI surveillance. She was\nconstantly shadowed by a bodyguard, even when she ran after the\nneighborhood ice cream truck. Brown, 30, the daughter of a Black\nPanther Party leader, once thought there was nothing unusual about\ngrowing up in a communal home and attending a grade school where\nstudents read Mao Tse-Tung's Red Book. ``A lot of people had this\nswashbuckling idea of the Panthers,'' she said. ``But when you're a\nchild it all seemed normal.'' Nothing was normal, though, about\ngrowing up in the 1950s and '60s as a child of the civil rights\nmovement. The people at the center of the struggle led dramatic,\noften dangerous, lives. So, too, did their kids. These children of\nthe movement _ the offspring of black militants, nonviolent\nactivists and even segregationist leaders _ are now adults. The\nChildren of the Movement have followed many roads in recent years.\nSome continue to carry on their parents' work. Others want only to\nforget their childhood.
