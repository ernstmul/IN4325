Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Janet Reno declined to block the\nrelease Monday night of an Egyptian man who had been held for three\nand a half years in a New York jail on secret evidence that the FBI\nhad said linked him to terrorists in the United States and Egypt.\n\n   With the attorney general not intervening in the case of Nasser\nAhmed, Ahmed was allowed to leave the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter in lower Manhattan Monday night, and was met by his wife,\nSalwa Elbayadi, and their three children. In a brief statement,\nAhmed thanked his lawyers for his freedom and lashed out at his\naccusers in the government.\n\n   ``They're liars, and they know they are liars,'' Ahmed said.\n\n   Reno's decision came 10 days after the INS commissioner, Doris\nMeissner, took the unusual step of citing ``national security\nimplications'' as a basis for asking Reno to order that Ahmed not\nbe released on bond while his case was reviewed by the INS.\n\n   The immigration service, based on classified evidence, had been\nseeking to deport Ahmed, who is seeking political asylum. Ahmed,\n39, had worked as a legal assistant to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the\nblind Egyptian cleric convicted of conspiring to blow up the World\nTrade Center and other New York landmarks. Although Ahmed has\nadmitted to being an admirer of Abdel Rahman, he has denied any\ninvolvement in terrorism.\n\n   One of Ahmed's lawyers, David Cole, said Monday night that with\nReno's decision, he is now ``very optimistic'' that Ahmed will be\ngranted political asylum, which he has been seeking for more than\nthree years.\n\n   ``The fact that the attorney general rejected the immigration\nservice's argument that he is a threat to national security should\ndispose of this case,'' Cole said.\n\n   Reno had said she would decide whether to intervene in the case\nby 5 p.m. Monday, and with no action by her as the deadline neared,\nthe INS said that ``upon further review'' it was withdrawing its\nrequest that Ahmed continue to be held.\n\n   Although Ahmed's case is not yet over _ he remains free on bond\npending a final ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals on\nwhether he should be granted asylum _ Reno's decision not to\nintervene is likely to be seen as another major blow to the use of\nsecret evidence by the INS in deportation proceedings.\n\n   The attorney general has the authority to review and overturn\ndecisions of the immigration courts, which are part of the Justice\nDepartment. Last summer, an immigration judge, after reviewing the\ngovernment's classified evidence against Ahmed, concluded that it\nwas weak, that he was not a threat to national security, and\nordered that he be granted asylum.\n\n   The INS then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which\nrecently ordered Ahmed released on bond pending its review of his\ncase. It was that decision to free Ahmed that the INS then appealed\nto Reno.\n\n   Just last month, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant, a\nfederal district judge in New Jersey ruled, for the first time in\nthe United States, that it was unconstitutional for the government\nto detain an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence. Shortly\nthereafter, the INS dropped its efforts to hold Hany Kiareldeen,\nwho had also been accused of terrorism and had been held for 19\nmonths in jail.\n\n   Neither Reno nor Meissner would respond to questions through\nspokesmen about the case.\n\n   But Ahmed's lawyers and others who have sharply criticized the\npractice of using secret evidence as a violation of due process,\nsaid they hoped that the decision indicated a rethinking of the\npractice at the highest levels of the government.\n\n   ``I'm pleased that he's released,'' said Rep. David Bonior,\nD-Mich., who has introduced legislation to ban the use of\nclassified evidence in deportation proceedings, ``but we still have\nabout 20 others who are being held, and it's a travesty of justice\nthat this continues in our country without people having the right\nto face their accusers.''\n\n   The release of Ahmed was also hailed by Arab-American groups\nMonday night.\n\n   Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim\nCouncil in Washington, said: ``Three and a half years is a long\ntime to wait.
