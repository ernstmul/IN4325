Some were coaxed by reporters, others came\nnaturally when the 6-foot-10-inch junior forward was asked to\nrecount the pivotal moments of a 64-54 victory over No. 3 seed\nCincinnati Sunday in the second round of the NCAA East Regional.\n\n   Barnes's smiles reflected his impact in guiding the sixth-seeded\nOwls to their first Sweet 16 appearance in six years. He led Temple\nto a regional semifinal matchup against No. 10 seed Purdue in East\nRutherford, N.J., by scoring a team-high 15 points against the\nrough-and-tumble Bearcats.\n\n   Still, given the many tragedies that have pockmarked his life,\nit seems a minor miracle that Barnes can find anything to smile\nabout. He was 8 years old when his mother was beaten to death\nduring a robbery of their home in Lexington, Ky.; he was a high\nschool senior in Hopkinsville, Ky., when his father was shot to\ndeath; and he was just beginning his freshman year at Temple when\nhis grandmother called with the news of the death of a close\ncousin.\n\n   And yet, with 32 seconds remaining in the Owls' triumph over\nCincinnati, a toothy grin creased Barnes's face as Temple fans\nfilled the FleetCenter with chants of ``Sweet 16! Sweet 16! Sweet\n16!''\n\n   How sweet it was, indeed.\n\n   ``I was just happy for our team,'' Barnes said. ``I just looked\nup and heard the crowd cheering and it was nice, because I don't\nnormally hear them cheering during the game.''\n\n   In this game, however, Barnes had other priorities. If Temple\nwas going to succeed against Cincinnati's muscular and heavily\ntattooed frontcourt, Barnes knew he would have to set the tone with\nphysical play in the low post. That was evident to him during\npregame warmups when players from both sides exchanged hard stares.\nFrom that moment, Barnes knew it was imperative that he, 6-9,\n240-pound freshman center Kevin Lyde, and 6-10, 290-pound freshman\nreserve Ron Rollerson do one thing. ``Go at 'em,'' he said.\n\n   ``It was very important that we got established, because\ndefensively they're a very strong team,'' Rollerson said. ``They've\ngot one guy pushing on you low and another guy coming at you\nweak-side to block the shot. But, yeah, they're one of the stronger\nteams in the country and, by looking at us, we're not. For us to be\npushing with them, tug for tug, played a huge role in that game.\nAnd Lamont did a great job in there for us. He's been one of our\ngo-to guys all year.''\n\n   Said Lyde, ``Lamont played good, he played good. He wanted to\nshow that we wasn't a pushover, because they were talking some talk\nto us, saying that we were scared. But he wanted to show them that\nhe wasn't scared.''\n\n   That much was evident when Barnes backed in Kenyon Martin,\nCincinnati's menacing 6-8, 230-pound junior center, and hit a\nturnaround jumper that gave Temple a 6-0 lead. Then, after Temple's\ntough matchup zone forced Cincinnati to commit a 35-second shot\nclock violation, Barnes stuffed home an offensive rebound. In all,\nTemple outrebounded the Bearcats, 32-31, getting 19 defensive\nboards.\n\n   ``We knew they were going to be physical and we know we didn't\nwant them to come out and get the upper hand on us, so we wanted to\nget physical right back with them,'' Barnes said. ``If the ref was\ngoing to allow that to go on, then we figured we should play\nphysical with them.''\n\n   If there was one sequence that illustrated Temple's tenacity on\nthe boards, it was late in the first half when Barnes helped keep\nthe ball alive for a third-chance 3-pointer by Quincy Wadley that\nlifted the Owls to a whopping 16-point lead, 29-13.\n\n   ``Yeah, I believe it kind of hurt them the way we were\nrebounding the ball,'' Barnes said. ``They probably weren't\nexpecting it, but it helped that our rebounding was good for us.''\n\n   It also helped that Barnes, Temple's second-leading scorer (12.8\npoints per game) and leading rebounder (7.0 per game), found the\nmark with his shot. He hit 5 of 8 field goal attempts, including a\ntowering baseline skyhook over Martin's hand that expanded Temple's\nlead to 31-18 in the second half.\n\n   Did the Bearcats underestimate Barnes?\n\n   ``Naw, I knew what he could do,'' Martin sniffed. ``He wasn't a\nsurprise to us. He made a couple of shots. Everyone's going to make\na couple of shots. They were tough shots where I had my hand up,\nbut they went in.''\n\n   Said Cincinnati assistant Rod Baker, ``Barnes got more touches\nthan he had been getting. He really got a lot more touches and they\nreally went to him and they felt like he was a guy who was going to\nget something done for them.''\n\n   Sunday in the FleetCenter, Barnes did just that. He got it done\nfor his team _ with a smile on his face _ and because he did, the\nOwls are in the Sweet 16.\n\n   ``This is great for us,'' Barnes said, smiling again. ``There\nwas a point in time where we hit a little slide and we lost a\ncouple of games, but to be able to be where we are right now is a\ngreat feeling.
