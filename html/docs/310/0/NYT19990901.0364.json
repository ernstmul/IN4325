Times News Service    \n\n   HOUSTON _ Michael McNulty and David Hardy refused to let go. In\nthe six years since the Branch Davidian compound went up in flames\non April 19, 1993, the two men have waged an obsessive quest to\ndiscredit the official account of what happened.\n\n   Espousing views popular with many right-wing groups, McNulty in\nparticular has blamed federal agents for the deaths of the Branch\nDavidian leader, David Koresh, and about 80 of his followers, a\nposition many critics regard as anti-government propaganda.\n\n   He and Hardy, however, regard as government propaganda the\nofficial explanation that Koresh and his followers carried out a\nsuicide pact by setting fire to the compound and shooting\nthemselves.\n\n   Now the fire at the compound, near Waco, has emerged again as a\nnational issue. As much as anyone else, McNulty and Hardy helped\nset in motion the events that have led Attorney General Janet Reno\nto consider an independent investigation.\n\n   An Arizona lawyer, Hardy, 48, requested, then sued the federal\ngovernment for documents and evidence related to Waco. Both men\npushed the Texas Rangers to launch an inquiry into the evidence\nunder state control.\n\n   They also fed information to lawyers representing the families\nof deceased Branch Davidians in a wrongful death lawsuit. And\nMcNulty, 53, a documentary filmmaker from Colorado, toured the\nstate evidence lockers four times, unearthing what he says are\npotentially flammable devices capable of starting a fire.\n\n   ``Mike and Dave deserve the lion's share of the credit for\ncoming up with the evidence,'' said Joe Phillips, a lawyer for the\nBranch Davidian families in the wrongful death lawsuit, scheduled\nto go to trial in federal court in Waco on Oct. 18. ``They've been\nworking on this for years.''\n\n   Once again, Waco is looming as a potential embarrassment for the\nFBI and the Justice Department. Congress is issuing subpoenas for\nevidence and witnesses in response to disclosures that the FBI,\ndespite denials to the contrary, used pyrotechnic tear-gas\ncanisters on the morning of the fire.\n\n   In the midst of it all, McNulty and Hardy are enjoying a broad\nnew forum, appearing regularly on radio and television programs.\nMcNulty often uses his media appearances to promote his forthcoming\ndocumentary, ``Waco: A New Revelation.'' In an interview on Court\nTV, McNulty waved a handwritten sign with a 1-800 number for the\nfilm.\n\n   Critics, however, say they fear that, while the two men may have\ncome up with some information worth examining, they have spread\nunsubstantiated and misleading information as well.\n\n   ``It's really unfortunate,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for\nthe Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors the militia\nmovement and other anti-government groups. ``This has given\ncredence to the rest of McNulty's view, which are unsupported.''\n\n   In a series of interviews, McNulty said he and Hardy met about a\ndecade ago in Southern California, either at a pistol range ``or\nsome kind of gun get-together.''\n\n   Hardy, a former Interior Department lawyer in Washington, said\nhe returned home to Arizona in 1990 and soon entered private\npractice, writing law review articles, including one he co-authored\ntracing the legal history of militias.\n\n   He described himself as ``an obsessive compulsive'' whose pet\nissue is his belief that law enforcement is becoming dangerously\nmilitaristic. Convinced that Waco proved his point, Hardy filed\neight Freedom of Information requests against the Justice\nDepartment and the FBI.\n\n   He got nowhere in what became a paper trail of fruitless\ncorrespondence with government officials. In 1996, Hardy filed a\nlawsuit, claiming that the government was stonewalling his efforts\nto obtain documents and evidence that belonged in the public\ndomain.\n\n   As it turned out, much of that evidence was stored in Austin,\ninside the evidence rooms of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nIn the aftermath of the Branch Davidian fire, the Texas Rangers\nwere asked to investigate and collect crime scene evidence, and\nthey kept it.\n\n   But when Hardy requested evidence from the Rangers under the\nstate's public records act, he was told that only the Justice\nDepartment could authorize access to the evidence. When he wrote to\nthe Justice Department, he was told that the evidence was under the\ncontrol of the Rangers.\n\n   Ultimately, a federal judge agreed that Hardy had been wrongly\ndenied documents and, as a penalty, awarded him more than $32,000\nin legal fees.\n\n   In the midst of his paper trail, Hardy wrote one letter to Texas\nofficials bluntly saying, ``Did it ever occur to you guys that\nyou're being set up?''\n\n   McNulty, meanwhile, was pushing on a different front. Until the\nearly 1990s, he sold insurance in Southern California, living\ncomfortably until he said the national company he represented\ndecided to uproot from the West Coast.\n\n   A Vietnam veteran who converted 20 years ago from Catholicism to\nthe Mormon faith, McNulty said the Branch Davidian fire reminded\nhim of a bloody incident in Mormon history, the Haun's Mill\nMassacre of 1838. In that episode, a mob in Missouri herded Mormons\ninto a grist mill and shot them to death. Ultimately, the Mormons,\nled by Joseph Smith, were ordered out of Missouri.\n\n   With his insurance business in disarray, McNulty said he became\nincreasingly consumed with Waco, obtaining evidence such as a copy\nof an infrared videotape of the incident. He moved his wife and\nfive children to Ft. Collins, Colo., and became a producer on a\ndocumentary, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement.''\n\n   A critical assessment of the role of the government, the film\nwas nominated for an Academy Award. The executive producer, Dan\nGifford, filed a lawsuit against McNulty, accusing him of selling a\npirated and re-edited version of the film, though the dispute was\nsettled out of court.\n\n   Despite the Oscar nomination (the film did not win), ``Rules of\nEngagement'' also was criticized for failing to accurately present\nevidence that placed the government in a favorable light, and for\nnumerous inaccuracies.\n\n   Nonetheless, Mark Pitcavage, a historian who specializes in\nright-wing extremist groups and operates The Militia Watchdog Web\nsite, said the film made McNulty a celebrity among followers of\nright-wing, anti-government groups.\n\n   ``The Waco documentary was highly publicized, but the\ninaccuracies were not,'' Pitcavage said. ``I don't think the\nMcNulty Waco documentary could even remotely be considered\nobjective.''\n\n   McNulty strongly denied that he is ``an anti-government type''\nand stoutly defends the findings in his first documentary. He\nclaimed that his upcoming film will detail his claims that federal\nagents started the Waco fire and killed the Branch Davidian\nfollowers. He has supported himself during his investigations with\npayments from his film company, MGA Films, and with stipends paid\nby plaintiff's lawyers in the civil case.\n\n   nn\n","Headline":"\nYEARS OF EFFORT BY TWO MEN SPURRED RE-EXAMINATION OF WACO \n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ Michael McNulty and David Hardy refused to let go.
