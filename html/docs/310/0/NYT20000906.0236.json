Times News Service   \n\n   Richard C. Youngken, a city planner with an eye for design\ndisasters, pulled into a parking lot next to a busy four-lane road\nin Middletown, R.I., and looked up.\n\n   There it was, a perfect specimen: a rugged brown utility pole\nthat stood at least 40 feet high, topped with transformers and\nstrung with wires leading off in every direction.\n\n   There were electric lines, telephone lines, cable television\nlines, even lines for the city's fire alarms _ all of them joining\non this tar-stained totem of technological ingenuity.\n\n   ``It's just like, `Good God, what have you got on that pole?'''\nYoungken said incredulously, craning his head out the window before\ndriving off to point out the next eyesore.\n\n   Hundreds of miles south, at a house in Faulkier County, Va.,\nFred Smith has his own problem with visual pollution. Through a\nwindow, he said, he can see a 200-foot cell phone tower that stands\non a low ridge against an otherwise uninterrupted view of the Blue\nRidge Mountains.\n\n   ``They are putting them up all over the place,'' said Smith, who\nhas written a letter to his local newspaper declaring the towers\n``this century's blight.''\n\n   Smith and Youngken are just two crusaders in a growing movement\nagainst the encroachment of obtrusive, ugly technology into daily\nlife. It is time, participants say, to realize that the devices we\nuse in our cars and houses can have an impact on our physical\nenvironments. Some people may be fortunate enough to live in cities\nor newly developed suburbs where wires, cables, transmitters and\nreceivers are buried underground or hidden on rooftops. But for\nmany Americans, those wires and towers are all too visible.\n\n   In the last few years, people have started to fight for measures\nthat will at least reduce the visual blight. Local government\nmeetings are full of heated discussions about what can be done, and\nin extreme cases, what lawsuits should be filed. City planners are\ntalking regularly to utility and telecommunications companies,\ntrying to fend off obtrusive additions to the landscape.\n\n   Some people active in the campaign are becoming well versed in\nthe intricacies of telephone transmission lines and cellular\nequipment so they can argue intelligently with those who install\nthem.\n\n   ``People care about how these things look,'' said Youngken, who\nis the director of the Dunn Foundation, a small organization in\nWarwick, R.I., that is dedicated to raising awareness of the value\nof well-planned, pedestrian-friendly towns and cities. Part of the\nfoundation's mission is to show people that the underpinnings of\ntechnology can be hidden.\n\n   ``The hope,'' he said, ``is that more people will expect it _\nand demand it.''\n\n   More than 73,000 cell phone towers with heights of at least 200\nfeet are scattered across the American landscape, according to the\nFederal Communications Commission. But that does not include myriad\nother cellular transmitters and receivers, called cell sites, that\nare placed on lower towers or on poles and buildings. Some experts\nestimate that more than 100,000 cell sites are now in place.\n\n   Ted Kreines, a consultant in Tiburon, Calif., who advises local\ngovernments on doing business with telecommunications companies,\nsaid that the growth of such technology is just the beginning. He\nestimated that as many as 1 million cell sites would be installed\nby the time technology companies reached their desired capacity for\nwireless data and voice transmissions.\n\n   Utility poles and wires are even more common. According to the\nFCC, more than 180 million telephone cables stretch across the\ncountry. The country has more than 3 million miles of overhead\npower lines, according to the Edison Electric Institute, an\nassociation of utility companies.\n\n   Fewer than 100,000 miles of lines are underground, the institute\nsays, and most of those buried lines are in large cities. For\nexample, American Electric Power, a large power company with\ncustomers in 11 Midwestern states, has buried only 12.3 percent of\nthe lines that carry electricity along streets to houses and\noffices in its coverage areas.\n\n   Newer tendrils of technology are also beginning to entwine\nthemselves around communities. Fiber optic cable, the backbone of\nmany future high-speed Internet lines, can be now seen along some\nhighways on utility poles. Television stations, which are required\nby the FCC to deliver digital broadcasts by 2003, have asked the\nagency for permission to pre-empt local regulations controlling the\nnumber and size of towers so they can put up more towers. Metricom,\na company that has built wireless data networks in Atlanta and San\nDiego so far, is putting radio transceivers on top of street lamps\nand traffic lights.\n\n   ``Nobody realizes there are all these things going up there,''\nKreines said. ``It's happening all over the country.''\n\n   Two seemingly unrelated trends have led to today's landscapes _\nand to the current fights over control of them. Telecommunications\nexperts say that deregulation is partly responsible.\n\n   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 not only led to more\ncompetition among providers of phone and cable services (and\ntherefore more towers and cables), but also included a provision\nthat protected companies from being shut out by local zoning laws.\nUnder the 1996 law, no city or town can keep a cell phone company\nfrom putting up sites within its borders.
