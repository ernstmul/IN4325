Most took to the local highway, lined with\nAmerican flags for the holiday, and snaked west in bumper to bumper\ntraffic to escape fires converging on their county seat.\n\n   By noon, the small town was nearly empty.\n\n   Left behind were fires so fierce even firefighters gave up\ntrying to control them.\n\n   ``We have a potential for a catastrophic event,'' Raymond\nGeiger, chief of field operations for the state Division of\nForestry, said as fires marched from the north, south and west.\n``It's called a firestorm.''\n\n   Banning fireworks _ a statewide order issued by Gov. Lawton\nChiles last week _ seems beside the point here.\n\n   If fires collide, they could suck air inward, spreading flames\neven faster, a phenomenon used in Allied bombing of Nazi Germany in\nWorld War II.\n\n   ``You just can't put enough resources on the fire line to stop\nit,'' said Larry Scovotto, executive director of the Florida Fire\nChiefs Association.\n\n   By evening, a dawn to dusk curfew had been set.\n\n   Further south in Brevard County, the largest fire burned out of\ncontrol as smaller fires crept into marshes out of firefighters'\nreach.\n\n   ``We have been saying at the state level that this has been the\nworst disaster since Hurricane Andrew,'' Titusville Fire Chief Tom\nHarmer said. ``I think we're changing that. This is worse than\nAndrew.''\n\n   The fires, still most dangerous in Flagler, Volusia and Brevard\ncounties, claimed another 165,000 acres statewide Friday, bringing\nthe total to 452,876 covering 707 square miles.\n\n   Some 72,000 people in Volusia County remained under Thursday's\nevacuation order, officials said. In Brevard County, of the nearly\n10,000 evacuated, all but those living in about 50 houses still\nthreatened by fire were allowed to return home late Friday. About\n200 structures from Titusville north to the Palm Coast\nneighborhoods in Flagler County have been destroyed and 55 people,\nmost firefighter, injured.\n\n   Meanwhile billowing smoke crept south, draping Palm Beach County\nand the Treasure Coast in a gauze of smoke.\n\n   And in what is becoming a depressing daily ritual, state\nofficials predicted worse awaits us.\n\n   ``This is a terrible day, a terrible week,'' said Sen. Bob\nGraham, who came to the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee\nwith Federal Emergency Management Agency director James Lee Witt\nFriday to tour scorched counties by helicopter. Gov. Lawton Chiles\nlater cancelled the trip.\n\n   Still, sea breezes Friday afternoon provided a little relief and\nby 7 p.m., a steady rain was falling on Flagler County. A half hour\nlater, the rain arrived in Volusia County. The three fires\nthreatening to join forces in Flagler County never met.\n\n   ``Thank goodness the Good Lord gave us some relief,'' Chiles\nsaid.\n\n   That didn't seem to matter on roads.\n\n   Nearly 150 miles of Interstate 95 remained closed from\nJacksonville to Cocoa Beach, with only a small stretch opened to\nevacuees fleeing Flagler County south. In the most dangerous areas,\ndozens of other roads closed. Tolls on Florida's Turnpike remained\nlifted.\n\n   Complicating the Flagler evacuation was a gasoline shortage.\nFuel distributors refused to send tankers loaded with gasoline over\nroads lined with flames, forcing emergency management officials to\ndip into fuel stores saved for hurricane evacuations.\n\n   And many evacuees fond Palatka shelters, expected to hold about\n2,000, full and pushed on through to Gainesville, an additional 40\nmiles west. Elsewhere shelters opened to offer accommodations: 12\nin Putnam County just west and two in Seminole County. A Disaster\nMedical Assistance Team to assist rescue workers was also\ndispatched to the area.\n\n   With so many homes empty, officials ordered 1,500 members of the\nFlorida National Guard to report for duty and stand guard. Earlier,\n562 members of the Guard arrived to fight the fires.\n\n   Still, fighting fires remained the biggest concern. In the\nnortheast corner of Flagler County where the worst blazes raged,\nrescue workers struggled to get close to several ritzy Palm Coast\nneighborhoods.\n\n   ``We're having a difficult time even getting back there with\ntelephone poles and trees down,'' said Richard Wieser, spokesman\nfor Flagler County Fire Department.\n\n   Meanwhile firefighters unaccustomed to fighting wildfires found\nthemselves facing a different enemy.\n\n   In Volusia County, firefighters surrounded a $200,000 house in\nthe Hunter's Ridge subdivision.
