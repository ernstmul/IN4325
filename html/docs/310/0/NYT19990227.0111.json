Times News Service   \n\n   For Microsoft's witnesses at its antitrust trial, the simple\nwords of introduction have become deeply unnerving. ``My name is\nDavid Boies, and I represent the United States.''\n\n   It is no wonder the big software company's witnesses have come\nto fear facing Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, in the\ngovernment's sweeping antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. Time\nafter time, he has caught Microsoft witnesses off guard as the\nwords from their mouths on the stand contradict the statements in\ninternal Microsoft documents or in their own e-mail.\n\n   Yet as both sides have now presented their main evidence, with\nthe last of Microsoft's 12 witnesses having finished on Friday, the\nquestion remains how much the company has been merely embarrassed\nor truly damaged in the courtroom.\n\n   The answer, legal experts say, is by no means as clear-cut as\nmight be suggested by the daily reports of Microsoft's miscues. The\nrecent drift of significant rulings in antitrust cases, they note,\ntends to be pro-defendant as the courts have been generally\nreluctant to second-guess business decisions.\n\n   ``Boies has done an excellent job, but the outcome of this case\nis still in doubt,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at George\nWashington University Law School. ``There is enough flexibility in\nthe doctrine of antitrust and enough uncertainty about how the case\nlaw applies to a dynamic, high-technology industry like computer\nsoftware that it could go either way.''\n\n   Put simply, the government's case is that Microsoft illegally\nused its monopoly power to thwart the challenge to its dominance\nposed by Internet software, stifling competition and innovation.\n\n   The 57-year-old Boies _ known for his rumpled blue suits, for\nhis uncanny memory and for having defended IBM in a marathon\nantitrust case _ has clearly put Microsoft through a humbling\ncourtroom experience.\n\n   He rattled a senior Microsoft executive by pointing out\nmisleading aspects in a videotaped demonstration that he introduced\nas evidence. He confronted Microsoft's economic expert with his\nearlier writing, which seemed to contradict his testimony, and the\nbefuddled witness said, ``What could I have been thinking?''\n\n   Last week, after Boies seemed to dismantle another Microsoft\nexecutive, forcing him to retract some of his testimony, Judge\nThomas Penfield Jackson joked as a Microsoft lawyer took over that\nthe task before him was a ``heroic endeavor.''\n\n   In the courtroom, Boies (pronounced BOYZ) is trying to undermine\nthe credibility of Microsoft's witnesses, which is a central\nelement in the government's legal strategy. Attacking Microsoft's\ncredibility, antitrust experts say, helps reinforce the strongest\nparts of the government's current case _ a case that suffered a\nsetback a month after it was filed last spring.\n\n   The government sued Microsoft last May in a complaint that\nfocused mainly on the Internet browser market. It contended that\nMicrosoft bundled its Internet browser to the company's\nindustry-standard Windows operating system in an illegal attempt to\nhobble a promising challenger, Netscape Communications, the pioneer\nin software used to browse the World Wide Web.\n\n   Microsoft replied that its Explorer browser and Windows were not\ntwo products but a single product, and that Microsoft could put\nanything it wanted to into Windows.\n\n   A federal appeals court essentially agreed with Microsoft last\nJune in a separate but related case. The court said Microsoft had\nthe right to fold a browser into its operating system as long as it\ncould make a ``plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.\n\n   After the appeals court ruling, the government added evidence to\nflesh out the allegation in its original complaint that Microsoft\nwas engaged in a ``pattern of anti-competitive behavior.''\n\n   By the time the trial began in October, the government's roster\nof witnesses included not only Netscape's president but also\nexecutives from Apple, IBM, Intel, Intuit and Sun Microsystems. In\none episode after another, they testified, Microsoft was a\nmonopolistic bully, using its power as a club against other\ncompanies to try to curb competition and divide markets.\n\n   Microsoft denies each allegation, saying that its accusers are a\ncollection of its rivals trying to portray routine business\nmeetings in the software industry as something sinister.\n\n   These allegations all center on private meetings _ some more\nthan three years ago _ involving Microsoft and other companies. The\ncourt must sort through the written evidence and the testimony to\ndecide whom to believe.\n\n   ``What happened at these meetings are we-said, they-said\ndisputes,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the\nJustice Department's antitrust division. ``That's why the\ngovernment has tried so hard to go after the credibility of\nMicrosoft's witnesses in general.''\n\n   The credibility strategy is also an effort by the government to\nbulletproof any lower-court ruling from appeals. No one can predict\nwith certainty how Jackson will rule in this nonjury trial.\n\n   His questions, comments and even rebukes to Microsoft witnesses\nmay indicate that Jackson leans toward the government. But\nregardless of the verdict at U.S. District Court, the case will\nalmost surely go to the U.S. Court of Appeals and perhaps to the\nSupreme Court.\n\n   Jackson could certainly be overruled on matters of evidence and\nlaw. But legal experts say it would be very difficult to reverse\nhim on findings of fact based on credibility. ``The judge can say I\nlooked all these witnesses in the eye and I don't believe them,''\nnoted Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.\n\n   The government has amassed a lengthy list of allegations. They\nrange from trying to get rivals to divide markets to pressuring\npersonal-computer makers and Internet service providers to agree to\nexclusionary contracts that unfairly curb competition.\n\n   Still, to rule in favor of the government, the courts must\ndecide that some of Microsoft's actions were clear-cut violations\nof the antitrust laws and not merely what one antitrust scholar\ncalled ingredients in a ``stew of unsavory behavior.''\n\n   Microsoft, legal experts say, has certainly been able to raise\ndoubts about some of the incidents. The government, for example,\ncontends that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape to divide\nthe browser market at a pivotal meeting on June 21, 1995, an offer\nNetscape declined. Based on the courtroom testimony and reams of\ne-mail evidence, the executives of the two companies left that\nmeeting with sharply differing views of what occurred.\n\n   The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts\nsay, is fairly high. The key case, they say, is a 1984 ruling\ninvolving American Airlines Inc. In a tape-recorded phone\nconversation, Robert Crandall, American's president, tried to\npersuade the president of Braniff Airlines to jointly raise their\nfares 20 percent on flights from Dallas. A federal appeals court\nruled against American, finding the evidence ``uniquely\nunequivocal.''\n\n   The Microsoft-Netscape meeting, antitrust experts say, does not\nseem to rise to that unambiguous standard of evidence. ``I doubt\nthat charge will hold up,'' said Kovacic of George Washington\nUniversity.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Microsoft insists that most of the credibility attacks on its\nwitnesses are on issues not central to the case.\n\n   For example, Boies got Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan\nSchool of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nto say he could not imagine what he was thinking when he wrote in a\n1982 Harvard Law Review article that ``persistent excess profits''\nsuggest that a company has considerable market power _ contrary to\nhis testimony that Microsoft's enormous profits are not an\nindication of monopoly power.\n\n   The next day, Microsoft's lawyer pointed out a footnote in a\n1982 article in which Schmalensee noted that extremely high profits\ncould be explained by ownership of a ``unique and long-lived\nasset.'' A particularly valuable intellectual property, like\nMicrosoft's Windows, could qualify as such an asset, Schmalensee\nsaid.\n\n   ``Are we sorry he did not go to the footnote on the first day?''\nsaid William Neukom, a senior vice president and general counsel of\nMicrosoft. ``Sure we are.
