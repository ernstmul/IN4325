Snyder, laughing at himself, agrees.\n\n   But keep in mind that the freezer contains the stuff of a\nmedical revolution in treating everything from Alzheimer's and\nParkinson's disease to strokes and spinal cord injuries.\n\n   Snyder lifted the freezer's lid recently to reveal hundreds of\nsmall vials containing clumps of brain cells, frozen in suspended\nanimation. These are neural stem cells _ immature, generic brain\ncells that can develop into any of the highly specialized cells\nthat make the brain work.\n\n   Snyder was the first to isolate and grow these stem cells in the\nlab about a decade ago, and, since then, he has rocketed to\nprominence on the hope of using them to heal a wide range of\npresently incurable brain disorders.\n\n   Now, for the first time ever, the traditional view of the brain\nas an organ where, after maturity, damaged or dead cells cannot be\nreplaced may be tottering. And the neural stem cells are acting as\nthe battering ram.\n\n   ``Stem-cell biology is enormously exciting right now and holds\npromise for really novel therapies _ not just symptomatic\ntherapies, but maybe cures,'' says Dr. Gerald Fischbach, director\nof the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\n   Snyder is even bolder, predicting the first human trials of\nstem-cell therapy may be only a year or two away, based on the\nrapid progress in lab animals.\n\n   ``Before the decade is out,'' he said, ``there will be some\ntherapeutic benefits'' from treating disease with neural stem\ncells. Parkinson's disease, caused by the death of brain cells in a\ncertain region, might be one of the first targets for stem-cell\ntreatment, he said; another is Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic\nlateral sclerosis, because it kills so quickly and there's no\ntreatment.\n\n   For the victims of incurable brain diseases and their loved\nones, Snyder is a beacon of hope, an optimist in the face of some\nof the cruelest afflictions known to humanity. His optimism and\nopenness to new ways of conducting research has made him a magnet\nfor support and advocacy groups for diseases from\nataxia-telangietasia, or A-T, to the rare Canavan syndrome.\n\n   ``Scientists like Evan Snyder are like first-round draft picks:\nEvery disease group wants to get their hands on someone like\nthis,'' said Brad Margus, founder of the Florida-based A-T\nChildren's Project.\n\n   Margus has two sons increasingly disabled by A-T, whose victims\nlose control over their body beginning at a young age and are\nhighly susceptible to cancer. That Snyder is both a pediatrician\nand a lab researcher ``means a lot to me,'' Margus said, because he\nhas both compassion for his patients and the skills to do\ncutting-edge research.\n\n   ``We often have a dilemma with a medical doctor who has noble\nreasons for being in medicine but doesn't understand the research\nprocess, or a PhD who gets turned on by working at the lab bench,\nbut can't seem to remember that these are people they're dealing\nwith,'' Margus said.\n\n   The excitement about Snyder's work is fueled in part by neural\nstem cells' astonishing ability to migrate through the brain,\nhoming in on nerves that have been damaged and transforming\nthemselves into specialized nerve cells of the appropriate type.\n\n   ``Somehow, the damage is sending out cries for help _ `We need\nneurons now!' _ and the stem cell can become a neuron'' and send\nout new ``wiring'' that makes the right connections to repair\ndamage, Snyder said.\n\n   ``I have a lot of admiration for Evan,'' said Dr. Paul Sanberg,\nchairman of neuroscience at the University of South Florida who\nalso does neural transplantation. ``He has started to focus on ALS\nand Parkinson's diseases, but his real love is these rare disorders\nin kids and preemies.''\n\n   In the most dramatic animal experiment, Snyder implanted neural\nstem cells into the brain of the mutant ``shiverer mouse,'' a lab\ncreation afflicted with continuous, severe tremors. Snyder found\nthat the implanted cells repaired the damage and eased the mouse's\nshivering. More recently, he's moved some of the stem-cell work\ninto monkeys, since they more closely resemble humans.\n\n   ``The notion that you can place (neural stem) cells in the\nnervous system and have them take on the characteristics dictated\nby the local environment is really revolutionary,'' said Fischbach\nof the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The\nnext big push, already underway, is to identify the signals that\ncall the cells to damaged areas, and try to duplicate them with\ndrugs.\n\n   Snyder and other scientists also are exploring a strategy for\ntreating inoperable brain tumors by inserting toxic genes into\nneural stem cells that would deliver the genes to the tumor and its\nspreading tentacles, like a suicide bomber. What's hoped for is\nthat the gene-carrying stem cells can follow the same pathways the\ntumor cells take as they weave their way inextricably into the\nbrain.\n\n   That goal is a very personal one. A close friend of Snyder died\nfrom a brain tumor in his 40s, and Snyder vowed to find a way of\nattacking tumors with his stem cells. He's reminded of this pledge\nwhenever he attends formal functions _ his tuxedo used to be that\nof his friend.\n\n   As the excitement about this new attack on brain diseases\nripples through the medical field and into public awareness,\nSnyder, a pediatrician and neurologist at Children's Hospital and\nHarvard Medical School, is increasingly in the limelight.\n\n   As a result, he's in nearly perpetual motion. Flying here and\nthere, he caroms from one scientific meeting to another, writes\npapers, supervises his laboratory and keeps in touch with myriad\nscientists with whom he's collaborating.\n\n   ``He is amazing in that regard. He's definitely like having a\nhyperactive kid _ the good part,'' said Xandra Breakefield, a gene\ntherapy researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital with whom\nSnyder is attempting to use stem cells against brain tumors.\n\n   Besides being a coveted speaker at scientific meetings _ he's\ngiven more than 35 such talks so far this year _ Snyder is much in\ndemand by the media. Engaging and possessing a boyish, telegenic\npresence, he's recently been on the ``Today'' show, National Public\nRadio, local television, and innumerable print stories on the new\nfrontier in brain science.\n\n   Snyder's method for isolating and growing neural stem cells is\nlicensed to Layton Bioscience Inc. of Atherton, Calif., which plans\nto develop stem-cell treatments. But, despite the potential for\nprofit, Snyder is not a wealth-seeking entrepreneur, said Gary\nSnable, the chief executive officer at Layton.\n\n   ``He's tremendously dedicated to solving some of the childhood\ndisorders, but he has no interest whatsoever'' in the business part\nof it, Snable said.\n\n   Snyder allows himself a modest bit of flash with his car, a\nsporty 1990 Honda Civic, which he said is something of a statement\nabout himself.\n\n   ``It's fast, it's compact, it's fire-engine red _ but old,'' he\nsaid. Age, in fact, is a sensitive topic. Snyder won't reveal his,\nsaying, ``Nobody knows how old I am,'' though he graduated from\ncollege in 1973, making him mid-to-late 40s.\n\n   Snyder's scientific portfolio, aside from his many publications,\nis his collection of slides he uses for talks. In addition to\nnumerical data, many of the slides are photographs of brain slices\nshowing the work of neural stem cells. Like the freezer, Snyder\nobsesses over his slides. He adds or removes slides for different\naudiences, and, after every talk, jots down which slides he used\nand how well the presentation went.\n\n   The A-T Children's project and several other disease groups have\nbeen funding Snyder directly _ bypassing the federal system of\nresearch grants _ to expand his team to focus on the rare diseases.\nAs a result, he said, ``We're progressing at a pace that is every\nscientist's dream, but it's very important not to sacrifice our\nscientific integrity'' in the rush toward a cure.\n\n   Nor can the research move into humans before the safety of stem\ncells is known. ``Can these things be controlled once they're\nimplanted?'' Fischbach asked. In addition, the Food and Drug\nAdministration will want assurance that the versatile cells won't\nproduce cancers, and that the cells can be produced with consistent\nquality control.\n\n   Fortunately for Snyder, his neural stem cell research doesn't\ncarry the ethical baggage of embryonic stem cell research because\nthe nerve cells don't have to be harvested from human embryos.\nSnyder's cells were taken originally from a fetus that was aborted\nfor other reasons several years ago. Now that the cells can be\nmaintained and their numbers increased in the lab, he said he\ndoesn't need to use any more fetal material.\n\n   Though he's driven, like many top researchers, and is prone to\nletting work dominate his life, Snyder has a wide range of\ninterests besides neural stem cells, such as linguistics and\ntheater.\n\n   While attending the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored\nin psychology, Snyder worked in summer camps for emotionally\ndisturbed children. He continued on to medical school at Penn, and\nat a time when most medical students are overwhelmed with studies,\nSnyder found time to start the Philadelphia Children's Theater\nGroup.\n\n   ``I found that, in front of kids, I could really open up,''\nSnyder said.\n\n   The amateur theater group, which performed in children's\nhospitals around Philadelphia, offered more than a creative outlet\nfor Snyder: He met his future wife after one of the shows when she\nasked to meet the writer of the production's songs.\n\n   Angela Vieira, Snyder's wife, is now a lawyer in the counsel's\noffice at New England Medical Center, and she's also a\nsemiprofessional singer with groups such as the Tanglewood Festival\nChorus. They live in Jamaica Plain.\n\n   But Snyder has difficulty squeezing in a personal life these\ndays, in part because be is so committed to the people he works\nwith as well as their scientific goals.\n\n   ``He really takes care of everyone in his lab; he's loyal and\nhe's just so supportive,'' said Kurtis Auguste, now a medical\nstudent in California who carried out a research project with\nSnyder while a Harvard undergraduate.\n\n   Even Snyder is feeling a need to rest a bit from the frantic\npace. In the past, he said, he hasn't really taken vacations;\ninstead, bringing his wife along to scenic or luxurious places he's\nbeen invited to speak.\n\n   But Snyder said she's wearied of waiting while he spends most of\nthe time talking shop with other researchers, and he's turning over\na new leaf.\n\n   ``We're going to take a real vacation this summer,'' he said,\n``and I define a vacation as someplace where you don't take along\nyour slides.''\n","Headline":"\nTHE MAN WHO FIXES BRAINS \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ Again and again, Dr. Evan Snyder checks a big\nnitrogen-cooled freezer in his lab at Children's Hospital, as\nanxious about its smooth operation as he might be about an ailing\nchild.\n","\n   ``I've even driven halfway home, turned around and come back,''\nhe admits, just to make certain the unit is humming along as it\nshould, chilling its contents to exactly 220 degrees below zero,\nFahrenheit.\n","\n   Call him obsessive.
