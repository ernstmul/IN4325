Times News Service   \n\n   NAPERVILLE, Ill. _ It was not until the summer of 1996 that\nEdward Paschke, a 54-year-old chemist working at the Amoco Research\nCenter here, realized that his life might be in danger.\n\n   In 1989, a rare form of brain cancer had been found in two\nresearchers with whom he had shared lab space. Amoco investigated\nand found that a third lab worker had had a similar tumor in 1986.\nAnd then in 1996, a malignant brain tumor had been discovered in\none of Paschke's closest colleagues.\n\n   ``That made four brain tumors within 150 feet of where I was\nworking,'' Paschke said recently, as he sat stiffly on a couch in\nhis home here, 25 miles west of Chicago. ``It was terrifying.''\n\n   When Paschke went for a checkup in summer 1996, doctors found a\nbenign brain tumor. And he was not alone. Over the next three\nyears, say officials at the company, now known as BP Amoco, at\nleast 20 brain tumors were found in current and former employees of\nthe center.\n\n   As a result, the company began the nation's most ambitious\ncorporate investigation into a cluster of cancer cases in an effort\nto learn if they were work-related.\n\n   ``We have a very unusual pattern of brain cancer here,'' said\nJim Lowry, who heads a task force on the brain tumors at BP Amoco,\nthe oil giant based in London that was created when British\nPetroleum acquired Chicago-based Amoco last year. ``You essentially\nhave this puzzle, and it points to a certain space and a certain\ntime.''\n\n   Cancer clusters are rarely found to have a common cause.\nEpidemiologists say that in large populations it is statistically\ninevitable that clusters of similar cases will show up in one place\nor another. In addition, cancer can develop over such long periods\nthat much of the evidence may be buried in the deep past.\n\n   ``The track record in these cases is not very good,'' said Peter\nInskip, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute in\nBethesda, Md., who studies brain tumor cases. ``More often than\nnot, people have not come up with a convincing answer.''\n\n   But Amoco, after consulting with the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention and other agencies, found the circumstances\nat Naperville so striking that it brought in experts from Johns\nHopkins University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to\ninvestigate.\n\n   Of the 20 brain tumors, which have caused five deaths so far,\nseven were a rare malignant cancer called glioma, which strikes\nonly five of every 100,000 people each year. And five of the\ngliomas occurred among chemists and lab technicians who worked over\nmany years in the same laboratory on the same corridor handling\ntoxic chemicals, including some known as heavy metal catalysts.\n\n   In that lab, the brain cancer rate was eight times higher than\nin the general population, the medical experts said.\n\n   Now, after a two-year investigation costing millions of dollars,\nBP Amoco officials hope that a comprehensive report due just weeks\nfrom now will provide some answers. If nothing else, it may sort\nout the thousands of chemicals found in the labs, to identify for\nfurther study those used in common by the cancer victims.\n\n   If the cause is determined to be work-related, officials say,\nthe company will ``do the right thing'' by compensating victims.\n\n   In the meantime, a number of brain tumor victims have sued BP\nAmoco, arguing that the company knowingly exposed its employees at\nNaperville to toxic chemicals and unsafe conditions for years by\nignoring complaints about a faulty ventilation system.\n\n   BP Amoco officials dispute the accusations, and say the medical\ninvestigators have largely ruled out the ventilation system as a\ncause of the brain tumors. But the officials also say there are no\nopposing ``sides'' in this case. The company says it wants nothing\nmore than to resolve the situation and determine the cause of the\ntumors.\n\n   Vicki Kastory, a BP Amoco spokeswoman, said the company had\nhired the best experts, reviewed the work histories of more than\n8,000 employees, taken apart laboratories and buildings, and\ncounseled and aided employees and former employees in what the\ncompany acknowledges has been a ``terrible tragedy.''\n\n   Amoco has gone to unusual lengths to uncover new brain tumor\ncases, despite the threat of litigation, and has voluntarily shared\nmuch of its information with the public and even the lawyers who\nhave filed suit.\n\n   ``This is frustrating for us,'' said Lowry, the head of the BP\nAmoco task force. ``We want to get to the bottom of this. I\npersonally knew five of the people with gliomas. Naturally, these\npeople want closure.''\n\n   Amoco closed the third-floor laboratory of Building 503, where\nfive of the seven glioma victims worked, in 1996, after the fourth\ncancer case was found there. Investigators said the victims\nsometimes worked on the same experiments, researching polymers and\nheavy metal catalysts.\n\n   ``The thing is that five of them worked in the same general\narea, and all of them crossed paths in the 1970s and 1980s, and\nthey were all long-term employees,'' said Michael Wells, a BP Amoco\nmanager on the brain tumor task force. He noted that the pattern of\nbenign tumors was not as unusual as that of the Glioma cases.\n\n   Soon after the floor was closed, Amoco says, Building 503 and\nthe entire 180-acre research campus were thoroughly tested and\ndeemed to be safe. Researchers tested the water, the walls for\nradiation, the soil, even a microwave tower outside.\n\n   While chemicals have not been proved to cause brain cancer, and\nthe mechanism by which they would cause cancer is not known,\neither, the investigators hired by Amoco believe that if the brain\ntumors are work-related, the most likely cause was contact with\ntoxic chemicals in Building 503.\n\n   nn\n","Headline":"\nOIL COMPANY CONFRONTS CLUSTER OF BRAIN TUMORS \n","Text":["\n   NAPERVILLE, Ill. _ It was not until the summer of 1996 that\nEdward Paschke, a 54-year-old chemist working at the Amoco Research\nCenter here, realized that his life might be in danger.\n","\n   In 1989, a rare form of brain cancer had been found in two\nresearchers with whom he had shared lab space.
