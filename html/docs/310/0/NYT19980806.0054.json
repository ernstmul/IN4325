If the tumor doesn't\nsucceed in recruiting new blood-vessel support, it is doomed to\nremain ``in situ'' _ a small, harmless knot of cells unable to\ninvade healthy tissue      or metastasize.\n\n   To understand why angiogenesis is so crucial for tumor growth,\nimagine a small town beside a large highway that has no exit\nnearby. The few houses and a store or two can get along fine with\nthis arrangement. But if the town wants to grow, there's a\nlogistical problem. As the town expands in all directions, trucks\ncan't make deliveries to the center of town. Without a network of\nnew roads connecting the highway and the buildings, the middle of\ntown will figuratively die.\n\n   And so it is with tumors. To grow beyond the size of a pea,\nFolkman proposed, the tumor has to induce nearby blood vessels to\ngrow new capillaries _ vessels thinner than a hair _ to reach into\nand entwine the cancer cells. This is angiogenesis, and it has\nrecently been shown to occur not only in the growth of solid tumors\nbut even in leukemia, a blood cancer.\n\n   Angiogenesis is a normal process that also occurs during\ndevelopment and childhood, and in adults in menstruation and\nwound-healing. The question Folkman asked was, how do tumors induce\nthe body to send out new capillaries? He reasoned that tumors must\nsend some sort of chemical signal _ and he proved correct.\n\n   In the early 1980s, he and colleagues in his laboratory\ndiscovered what would be the first of a number of ``angiogenic''\nsubstances that serve as ``on'' signals for new capillary growth. A\nfew years later, he found the first of numerous inhibitors of\nangiogenesis _ ``off'' signals in the process. It appears the body,\nand tumors themselves, make these competing substances as part of\nan on-off system to regulate normal new blood-vessel growth. Most\nrecently, Folkman and others have discovered that a tumor's\nangiogenic switch goes on when the pro-angiogenesis signals\noutweigh the inhibitory ones.\n\n   Then came a momentous discovery that tied together angiogenesis\nand the burgeoning field of cancer genetics _ the finding by Noel\nBouck at Northwestern University Medical School that a\ntumor-suppressing gene called P53, which normally keeps cancer from\narising, works in part by switching on an inhibitor of\nangiogenesis. A defective P53 permits angiogenesis to take place,\nmaking cancer more likely to develop.\n\n   The list of different substances that block angiogenesis is\nalready long, and growing. It includes:\n\n   _Thalidomide, the infamous morning-sickness drug that caused\nsevere birth defects in the early '60s;\n\n   _A form of interferon and a form of interleukin, both substances\nin the immune system;\n\n   _Angiostatin and endostatin. Discovered by Dr. Michael O'Reilly\nin Folkman's laboratory, they are fragments of larger proteins\nfound in the body;\n\n   _Monoclonal antibodies made in the lab to block a chemical\nmessenger called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which\ninduces endothelial cells to divide and form new vessels.\n\n   No one knows why tumors produce substances that inhibit\nangiogenesis as well as others that promote it. But the phenomenon\nmay explain why metastases, cancer cells that have escaped the\noriginal tumor and lodged elsewhere in the body, often grow rapidly\nafter the primary tumor is removed.      Whatever the explanation, it\nis good fortune for cancer therapy that these potent vessel\ngrowth-blockers exist. And their discovery has reversed years of\ndisbelief that dogged Folkman: He is now considered almost a\nshoo-in for a Nobel Prize, particularly if the angiogenesis\ninhibitors have a major impact on cancer treatment.\n\n   ``Judah is a visionary, and as such, very few people understood\nthe message he was trying to project,'' says Isaiah (Josh) Fidler,\na cell biologist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston\nwho also does research on angiogenesis.\n\n   It was just last fall that Folkman reported results of the most\ndramatic experiment of his career. Using a combination of\nangiostatin and endostatin, he and his colleagues were able to\nshrink large tumors and mestastases in mice to the point of\nundetectability, and they remained microscopic indefinitely.\n\n   Moreover, the drugs didn't lose their effect over time. That was\nan unprecedented result.\n\n   While Folkman and the rest of the world await the first human\ntrials of angiostatin and endostatin, researchers are developing\nnumerous twists on the basic theme.\n\n   Just last month, an experiment reported in the journal Nature\nGenetics showed that angiostatin combined with radiation treatment\nshrank tumors in mice far more effectively than either agent alone.\nFolkman hailed the work as laying the foundation for a new form of\nradiation treatment that could be more potent without causing\nadditional side effects.\n\n   Yet Folkman and others continue to emphasize that none of this\ngood news has meaning for human patients until the drugs prove\nthemselves in clinical trials.\n\n   The first-generation, relatively weak inhibitors that have made\nit into human testing haven't performed like miracle drugs, but\nthere have been some tantalizing results.\n\n   Last April, a team from M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute reported\nthat a woman with metastatic cervical cancer who received an\nangiogenesis blocker called TNP-470 for 22 months in 1995 went into\ncomplete remission of her disease _ and suffered few side effects.\nSuch remissions are rare.\n\n   Encouraging responses to angiogenesis inhibitors have also been\nseen in trials carried out at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and\nother centers.\n\n   In some brain tumor patients, the drugs shrank or halted the\ncancer for many months. ``There are some long-term survivors, but\nwe don't know what this means,'' because of the small numbers of\ncases, says Dr. Howard Fine, a brain tumor specialist at\nDana-Farber.\n\n   There are signs of anticancer effect in some cases, he says,\nwhich is ``proof of principle that using an entirely different\napproach to cancer therapy we can actually cause regression of\nhuman cancer.
