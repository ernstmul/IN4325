Besides the usual side effects of fatigue, hair loss, skin\nrash and nausea, it also can cause hearing loss, spinal growth\ndeficit, hypothyroidism and mental retardation.\n\n   Burzynski says his antineoplastons, a synthesized version of\nhuman peptides found in blood and urine, can be an effective cancer\ntreatment without debilitating and lasting effects. But there is\nonly anectdotal evidence it works, because Burzynski has never done\nclinically approved trials.\n\n   Burzynski's use of antineoplastons caused a decades-long feud\nwith the government that culminated in 1997, when he was acquitted\nof the last of 75 federal charges related to the interstate\nshipment of the drug. But he is only now allowed to prescribe\nantineoplastons in FDA-approved clinical trials; before trying the\ntreatment on brain cancer, patients must already have failed to\nprogress on chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n   Navarro's cause has been trumpeted by Republican presidential\ncandidate and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who made it the subject\nof a closing statement at one debate and opening statement at\nanother attended by the family.\n\n   Keyes wrote a letter _ also signed by John McCain, George Bush,\nGary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch _ to Health and Human\nServices Secretary Donna Shalala, calling on her to allow immediate\nantineoplaston treatment by Burzynski.\n\n   ``It should be the right of every responsible American citizen\nto seek the medical care of their choice without government\nbureaucracies standing in their way,'' wrote Keyes. ``Time is\nrunning out for Thomas Navarro and for countless Americans like\nhim.''\n\n   Though James Navarro said negotiations are under way, an FDA\nspokesman said Friday he was not aware of any agency response to\nthe letter or a similar one to the FDA from Rep.       Dan Burton,\nR-Ind. The spokesman stressed that the FDA is a scientific\nregulatory agency, not a political body.\n\n   ``There is no scientific or medical justification for approving\nor even condoning the use of an unproven, potential therapy when a\nvery effective treatment exists and has become, in fact, a\nuniversally recognized standard of care,'' Richard Pazdur, director\nof the FDA's Division of Oncology Drug Products, told The Cancer\nLetter. ``Ethically, giving a child an experimental product in such\ncircumstances flies in the face of all the guidelines and\nregulations designed to protect children as research subjects.''\n\n   The Navarros met last week with doctors at the University of\nTexas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston but nothing came of\nit. In the meeting, arranged by Texas Commissioner of Health\nWilliam R. Archer III at the behest of Gov. George Bush, doctors\nsaid they could treat the tumor with lower dosages and great\nattention to alleviating side effects.\n\n   But although James Navarro said he was impressed with the\nhonesty of those doctors _ his former doctors in Arizona only\ngrudgingly responded to questions about the effects of chemotherapy\nand radiation, he said _ he and his wife left the meeting convinced\nBurzynski remains their son's best option.\n\n   Two studies are commonly cited about the effectiveness of\nchemotherapy and radiation. One, which studied children from\ninfancy to 4 years of age, reported a five-year survival rate of 51\npercent, significant neuropsychologic injury and a high rate of\ndisease recurrence. Another, which studied children from 3 to 10,\nreported a survival rate of 70 percent, much less neuropsychologic\ninjury and a 10 percent rate of recurrence. Doctors say the child\nfares better the older he or she is.\n\n   Navarro said he believes studies are manipulated to sell a\nproduct _ ``otherwise, people wouldn't be dying of cancer every 60\nseconds.''\n\n   At the FDA's request, Burzynski submitted a alternative therapy\nprotocol under which the Navarros wouldn't need to do chemotherapy\nand radiation first, but it was rejected. He said it'd take 57\nyears to treat enough patients with the same tumor as Navarro's to\nsatisfy the FDA's rules for treating Navarro without prior\nconventional treatment.\n\n   But Burzynski said he believes a way will be found to allow him\nto treat Navarro. ``I don't think the FDA will fight this to the\nend,'' he said.\n\n   The Navarros have been in Houston since Nov. 10, less than two\nmonth after conventional doctors in Arizona discovered Thomas had\nmedulloblastoma, performed surgery to remove it and then finally\ntold them about some of the typical effects of chemotherapy and\nradiation. With any follow-up treatment, disease recurrence kills\n90 percent of patients in 1 year and the remaining 10 percent in 2\nyears, the FDA says.\n\n   The Navarros say they fear returning to Arizona because their\nformer doctors in Arizona have reported them to Child Protective\nServices, which requested an interview with them through their\nattorney. James Navarro said such cases usually lead to CPS taking\nthe child. A CPS spokesman in Arizona would not confirm the agency\nhad any such plans.\n\n   The Navarro boy's condition was initially diagnosed as the flu,\nbut his persistent symptoms progressed into vision problems and\nincreased lethargy. An MRI scan during a second exam revealed the\ntumor.\n\n   Surgery two days later was successful but initially left the boy\nwith ``no speech, no sight and no ability to walk,'' said his\nfather. Though those functions came back over time, ``his cognitive\nskills are still lacking _ he's like a 4-year-old newborn in many\nways.'' That's the primary reason, his parents say, they don't want\nto subject him to further toxic effects.\n\n   ``Thomas is such a special kid that everyone who meets him falls\nin love with him,'' said James Navarro. ``He so loves life. That's\nwhy we don't want to see him lying in bed, writhing in pain, his\nsenses dulled, his sight, hearing and memory gone and his IQ\ndiminished.''\n\n   Navarro said he hopes for a breakthrough soon.
