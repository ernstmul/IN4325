Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI BEACH _ For party pilgrims, this billion dollar sandbar is\nPlymouth Rock.\n\n   Over this four-day Thanksgiving weekend, Miami Beach is full of\nvisitors thankful to be celebrating freedom from the holiday\ntraditions of traffic, indigestion and even family. Clearly, they\nare making up their own traditions as they went along. There are\naffluent, muscular gay men in town for the bacchanal known as White\nParty Weekend. There are also droves of antic straight people\ninfected with Running Sickness, which might be described as the\nuncontrollable urge to race around seeing and being seen while on\nvacation.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   There is even a disheveled, antifashion icon in town _ Lou Reed\n_ staying at the oh-so-fashionable Delano hotel.\n\n   ``It's great to be out of New York,'' he said on Wednesday\nnight. Along with an unruly mob of dancing kings and queens, he was\nhanging out at the hotel's new weekly bash known, quite simply, as\nthe Wednesday party, and for a man with such a dark view of the\nworld, he seemed strangely happy. ``The beach is beautiful, the\npeople are nice and the food is great down here,'' he said,\nsounding more like a Chamber of Commerce spokesman than a dyspetic\ndowntown art rocker. ``So what's not to like about it?''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   Welcome to a family-free-zone where anything goes.\n\n   ``Miami during Thanksgiving,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, fashion\ndirector of Bloomingdale's, ``is for people who don't want to be\nwith family and for people who don't have family to be with. It\nworks for me. All I require is a piece of pumpkin pie.''\n\n   Christopher Makos, the photographer who used to help his pal\nAndy Warhol find cheap caviar for Thanksgiving dinners, said: ``I\ndon't bother going up to Massachusetts to see my father for the\nholiday. If I went with Dad, he'd just take me to some dinner\nfilled with relatives who I don't even know. A girl once told me\nshe was my niece and I said, `What's a niece?' To be honest, my\nfamily likes seeing my name in print more than seeing me in person.\nMy favorite holiday is Halloween because it's about the self.''\n\n   Like many of his fellow revelers in Miami, Makos is partying as\nthough it well, 1999. The gay influx of 15,000 visitors alone is\nexpected to generate $10 to 12 million dollars in revenue,\naccording to the City Manager's office.\n\n   ``For many of these people, the gay ones especially,'' said Mark\nLeventhal, a popular local D.J., ``this holiday brings up upsetting\nissues having to do with family, so they come here to party\ninstead. If they do see their parents, you don't hear about it.''\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   Jennifer Rubell, whose family owns the chic Albion Hotel and the\nBeach House in nearby Bal Harbour, agreed, adding that some gay\nrevelers quietly visit parents, then make a beeline for South\nBeach. Although she opted to spend the holiday in Boston with her\nboyfriend's family, she said she understood the extravagances of\nWhite Party Weekend.\n\n   ``Thanksgiving is a real question for gay people,'' she said.\n``They want a sense of community and family, and that's what their\nweekend here together is all about. It's a time for celebrating\nfreedom in the extreme. Not that long ago, gay people could not be\nso out of the closet. That's something to be thankful for, and it\nhas nothing to do with eating turkey.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   The White Party is one of a number of gay events known as\ncircuit parties held year-round in various cities, and they have\nsometimes been criticized for drug use and unsafe sex. A Fire\nIsland edition, the Morning Party, was cancelled last summer after\na fatal drug overdose at the 1998 party. With all the drug use and\nalcoholism and the relentless trawling for sexual partners at\ncircuit parties, one could be puritanical and argue that there's\nsomething a bit unhealthy about all the celebration, no matter how\nfabulous it appears.\n\n   Dr. Donald Leichter, a clinical psychologist at Beth Israel\nhospital in New York, who did not make it down this year, said:\n``The whole party scene in Miami, straight or gay, might be as\noverblown as it is because its some kind of desperate reaction\nagainst the reality of who you are. Many of these people are\nbothered by how normal or fragile their families are. I know I was\nwhen I was younger. Wanting to be fabulous was this kind of\ndesperate attempt for me to pretend I wasn't from a plain family\nfrom New Jersey. But of course I was. I used to hate Thanksgiving.\nNow I love it, from my father's bad jokes to the canned cranberry\nsauce. I look forward to every silly ritual.''\n\n   On Wednesday night, meanwhile, when most of Manhattan was\nshutting down for the holiday, the South Beach ritual of aggressive\nsocializing was at a fever pitch. From Joia and Cafe Tabac on the\nlower end of the beach to the Forge up north on 41st Street, I\nseemed more like Halloween than Thanksgiving.\n\n   Pat Field, the kooky downtown fashion designer, was skulking at\nthe Delano party under a head of candy-red hair. Over at Bar Room,\nowned by the F.O.M. (Friend of Madonna) Ingrid Casares, a raucous\nparty given by Ocean Drive magazine drew in a teeming mass of\ntatooed men, all talking into little wires attached to cellular\nphones (the latest thing _ to prevent brain cancer, you know), and\nbodacious women wearing masks of heavy makeup and not much else.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   They weren't all experiencing complete freedom from want,\nhowever, since many of them, even at 3 o'clock in the morning, were\nstanding outside on the wrong side of a velvet rope.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n   Up at the Forge, where a Wednesday singles night attracts a\nlubricious and vehemently straight crowd, the influx of implants\nwas intense. Next door, at Cafe Nostalgia, a new club for Cuban\nmusic, the dance floor was filled with trendy Latins who were\ndancing to a song about sugar daddies.\n\n   Forget Protestants in buckle shoes. All over town there were\nPradastants in Prada shoes. Even if they weren't model citizens,\nmany of them looked like models.\n\n   ``Like the city of Miami Beach itself,'' said Tom Austin, who\ncovers the scene for Ocean Drive magazine, ``people around here\nlook better at night.'' It was only a few hours before dawn and he\nwas walking past a shockingly busy News Cafe when a prostitute\nemerged from the shadows, and patted his belly. ``Hey beer gut,''\nshe said, ``got a light?''\n\n   He told her he did not smoke. ``Well,'' she said, ``you\nshould.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Once upon a time not so long ago, this was a family kind of\ndestination. Despite the fact that the Delano now likes to promote\nits fashionable self as a family resort, the whole city seems more\nof a playground for people with very loud inner children, rather\nthan real ones.\n\n   At 5 p.m. on Thursday, however, five beautifully dressed and\nwell-behaved little boys in jackets and club ties did sit down with\ntheir parents for Thanksgiving dinner at the Delano. That's when a\nguest got up and complained to the host that he and his wife wanted\nto have a romantic evening, and that he had been guaranteed that\nthere would not be any children around. ``I told him that was\nridiculous,'' said Gilbert Stafford, the host.\n\n   Several hours later, when the hotel's bar and lounge areas were\nreally hopping, John Lyons, a New York-based movie producer whose\nhits include ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who\nShagged Me,'' walked into the lobby. He had just returned from a\nbig family dinner at his mother's home in suburban Boynton Beach,\nwhere he dutifully mashed potatoes and put up with a few lovingly\nraised eyebrows from relatives about his life as a New York City\nhotshot.\n\n   He seemed relieved to be back at the Delano, where he has spent\nhis last five Thanksgiving weekends. ``I love my mother and she\nmakes a beautiful turkey dinner, but I don't really feel at home in\nher house,'' he said as he walked through the surreally decorated\nhotel lobby teeming with surreally thin fashion people. ``Of\ncourse, I'm not exactly sure I feel at home here either,'' he said,\n``but that's another story.''\n\n   A few minutes later, he was walking into Joe Allen to deliver a\npiece of his mother's pumpkin pie to Ruttenstein, who was finishing\ndinner with a friend. Ruttenstein has not had a family Thanksgiving\nin years, and he seemed very thankful to be experiencing a mother's\ncooking without actually experiencing a mother.\n\n   ``I'm very touched that you and your mother remembered me,'' he\ntold Lyons. After taking one bite, he broke into a smile so wide it\nalmost seemed as though he was going to cry.\n\n   ``This pie,'' he exclaimed, ``is absolutely perfect.''\n","Headline":"\nGIVING THANKS IN MIAMI FOR A FAMILY-FREE THANKSGIVING \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI BEACH _ For party pilgrims, this billion dollar sandbar is\nPlymouth Rock.\n","\n   Over this four-day Thanksgiving weekend, Miami Beach is full of\nvisitors thankful to be celebrating freedom from the holiday\ntraditions of traffic, indigestion and even family.
