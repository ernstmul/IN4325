The others\ninclude San Francisco, Milan, Seoul and Singapore.\n\n   Motorola's stock and corporate reputation took a beating during\nthe mid-1990s amid stalled earnings and a disastrous investment in\nthe now-bankrupt $3 billion Iridium satellite-phone project.\n\n   But in the last 16 months, a turnaround effort has boosted\nMotorola stock from less than $43 a share to as high as $129, and\ncompany officials hope to turbo-charge efforts to develop new\nwireless communications devices by tapping in to the MIT and\nKendall Square tech communities.\n\n   ``We're a company with 70 years of history, and we've done some\nfantastic things, and we've done some dumb things,'' Growney said.\n``We've just exited one of our dumb periods.''\n\n   Motorola also will use its new office at Two Cambridge Place,\nopening in February, as a field office for its venture-capital arm,\nwhich has taken stakes quietly in more than 20 local startup\ncompanies involved in communications, semiconductor research and\nbiotechnology.\n\n   Growney would not identify local recipients of Motorola\ninvestment, saying, ``My competitors would love to know the precise\ndirection we're headed in.'' But he said he sees ``significant\nopportunity'' for more investments locally, aimed at supporting\nMotorola product development and research.\n\n   In recent months, Motorola designers have been demonstrating a\nprototype Dick Tracy-style wristwatch phone and super-cheap phone\nhandsets that are activated by a credit card with a number keypad\nbuilt in. Wireless companies could sell calling time through the\ncards and give away the matchbook-size handset.\n\n   Motorola expects to employ 20 designers at the 8,000-square-foot\nlab on the outskirts of Kendall Square, including people who now\nwork at its Advanced User Interactions Lab in Illinois. Motorola\nhas 1,000 Massachusetts employees now, chiefly at a Mansfield\nplant.\n\n   ``We're really looking to capture the Cambridge buzz,'' said Dan\nWilliams, director of consumer design and innovation. One focus of\nthe new lab will be improving ``wearable,'' voice-controlled\ncommunications devices that could be as small as a collar stay in a\nshirt, a pendant or a cufflink.\n\n   Cell phones and related gear accounted for about 42 percent of\nMotorola's 1998 net sales of $29.4 billion. Radio devices were 18\npercent, and pagers and other information and media products\naccounted for 9 percent.\n\n   In the last five years, the Schaumburg, Ill., company has\nsponsored a group of seven to nine ``Motorola Fellows'' associated\nwith MIT's Media Lab who have been developing new concepts for\nwireless communication.\n\n   Current fellow Rob Poor, an MIT PhD candidate, has been working\non a concept he calls the ``embedded network'' _ equipping a vast\narray of objects, and even people's bodies, with devices that\ncommunicate by low-power radio waves.\n\n   ``Someday there will be network connections in almost everything\nin our world, not unlike the way there is printing on almost\neverything in our world,'' said Poor, a Silicon Valley expatriate\nwhose past jobs include working for the Grateful Dead rock band and\nGeorge Lucas's film studio.\n\n   In the long term, Poor thinks wireless phone systems could be\ndeveloped that would use each phone to relay calls throughout the\nsystem, eliminating the need for base stations with tall antennas\nand sharply reducing power needs for each phone.\n\n   Once radio transmitters become cheap enough, Poor also has ideas\nfor equipping individual Federal Express packages and FedEx drop\nboxes with chips to communicate the location of packages.
