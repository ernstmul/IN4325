Of them, more than 90,000 sustain lifelong\ndisabling conditions. The annual cost of traumatic brain injuries\nin the United States is $48.3 billion.\n\n   In Georgia alone, more than 60,000 people incur a brain injury\neach year; about 1,700 of them die and 2,000 face permanent\ndisabilities.\n\n   But because brain injuries are individual, it is often difficult\nto predict what those disabling conditions may be. Depending on\nwhich portion of the brain is damaged, communication or\ncoordination skills may be affected in varying degrees.\n\n   ``The more severe the injury, the longer the recovery period and\nthe greater the deficits the injury creates,'' said Dr. Alan\nHarben, a physiatrist at Emory University (Ga.).\n\n   Automobile accidents account for 50 percent of brain injury\nincidents while others are the result of sports accidents, falls or\ngun violence. Most incidents cause one of two types of injuries.\n\n   In one, the brain directly hits the skull. Most often, the\nimpact leads to injuries in the frontal and temporal lobes, the\nparts of the brain that plan day-to-day activities and regulate\nmemory. In addition, car accidents can also force the head to slow\ndown too quickly, jolting the brain within the skull and damaging\nnerve cells and blood vessels by shearing or stretching them.\n\n   But that's not all.\n\n   ``The mechanical trauma happens in about 50 milliseconds, but\nover the next few hours and days, there are biochemical events\noccurring that lead to toxic injury to the brain,'' Harben said.\n\n   In the secondary phase, the injury can worsen, as toxic\nchemicals can cause the brain to swell. Damage to other organs in\nthe body can cause drops in blood pressure or in oxygen\nconcentration in the bloodstream, both affecting the brain, Harben\nsaid.\n\n   In the end, doctors diagnose patients with mild, moderate or\nsevere brain injuries. Effects of mild brain injuries - dizziness,\nconfusion, fatigue - usually disappear within a few hours or days.\n\n   Those with moderate brain injuries suffer a loss of\nconsciousness for less than six hours. They have some degree of\nimpairment in thinking, attention, problem solving and\nconcentration, but will eventually resolve most problems within\nthree to six months.\n\n   Severe brain injuries cause a loss of consciousness for more\nthan six hours. Patients may have amnesia for more than a day,\nsuffer cognitive deficits and experience paralysis, a loss of\nbalance, visual and hearing difficulties and sometimes behavior\nproblems.\n\n   Support groups and the Brain Injury Association of Georgia help\npatients and families struggling to cope.\n\n   Georgia's brain injury support groups are behind Amendment 3, a\nstate constitutional amendment on November's ballot establishing a\nBrain and Spinal Cord Injury Trust Fund, with money from a 10\npercent increase in fines for drunken drivers.\n\n   For more information, contact the Brain Injury Association of\nGeorgia at 1-888-334-2424 or the national family help line at\n1-800-444-6443.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n     \n     \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA_As seat belts, air bags and medical technology have\nimproved chances of surviving a head injury in recent years, health\ncare specialists have stepped up efforts to treatand research brain\ninjuries.\n","\n   Almost 375,000 Americans are hospitalized each year because of a\ntraumatic brain injury.
