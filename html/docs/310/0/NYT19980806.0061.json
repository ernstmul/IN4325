(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By LARRY TYE  \n c.1997 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   AMSTERDAM _ To most cancer doctors, a breast tumor is a poison\nthat must be removed as quickly as possible.\n\n   But to Dr. Herbert M. Pinedo, it's also its own potential\nantidote.\n\n   The idea is to make the tumor turn on itself. Pinedo came to\nthat radical concept after watching survival rates climb by 25\npercent when, before operating, he gave women with large tumors\nchemotherapy treatments large enough and for long enough to\nsubstantially shrink the growths. That meant putting off surgery, a\nprospect that would have alarmed most oncologists. But Pinedo\nthinks the delay allowed the body to kick-start its own\ndisease-fighting mechanisms even as the chemotherapy controlled the\ncancer.\n\n   Whether or not those particular findings hold up, the Dutch\ndoctor's strategy of trying new and creative uses of long-standing\ncancer treatments is being replicated worldwide. The result: tens\nof thousands of lives saved or prolonged.\n\n   ``It's the incremental improvements that matter,'' says Pinedo,\nwho runs the medical oncology program at the Free University in\nAmsterdam and is considered one of Europe's foremost cancer\nresearchers.\n\n   He knows that retooling conventional therapies never will garner\nthe attention of the would-be breakthroughs that seek to starve\ntumor cells or fix cancer-spawning genes. But he also knows that\nexciting laboratory advances aren't much help for cancer patients\nlike Arne Roodenberg.\n\n   Roodenberg had an enormous tumor in her breast, one that she and\nher doctors for months mistook for extra milk produced while she\nwas breast-feeding. By the time it was diagnosed nearly three years\nago and she went to see Pinedo, it had grown to more than three\ninches across, large enough to set off alarms and get her enrolled\nin his clinical trial.\n\n   ``When I got my first chemotherapy my tumor was 8 centimeters;\nthe next day it was 4. In one day. It was great,'' the 38-year-old\nmother of three recalls. The treatment worked so well that\nRoodenberg went on an extended regimen, followed by surgery and\nradiation. ``And I've had no cancer for two-and-a-half years.\n\n   ``I have to say that we are happy that doctors know so much\nabout this. We are happy that many women can be better about breast\ncancer.''\n\n     \n   \nBlazing new ground with radiation therapy\n\n     \n  \n\n   Nowhere is the incremental progress driving today's cancer\ntreatment more apparent and impressive than in radiation therapy.\nAnd nowhere have radiologists had more success in pushing that\nenvelope than in Boston.\n\n   One successful treatment involves a proton accelerator, which\ndraws on the special properties of positively-charged nuclei of\nhydrogen atoms to target radiation directly at the tumor. While\nconventional X-rays go clear through a patient, losing energy along\nthe way, a proton device delivers a stream of particles directly to\nthe tumor. Once there, the radiation simply stops, which means\nthere is more energy hitting, and hopefully killing, the tumor, and\nless damage to surrounding tissue.\n\n         The therapy should take another big leap forward in December\nwhen Massachusetts General Hospital opens its $46 million Northeast\nProton Therapy Center in what used to be the workout yard of the\nCharles Street Jail. The facility, jointly funded by the hospital\nand the National Cancer Institute, will pump out radiation at\nhigher energies, allowing it to reach deeper-seated tumors in the\nlungs, abdomen, prostate, uterus, bladder, and rectum. And the beam\ncan be rotated to reach different parts of the patient; in the old\nHarvard cyclotron, where proton treatment is now performed, the\nbeam is fixed and the patient must be rotated.\n\n   ``We'll be able to treat any site in the human body,'' says Dr.\nHerman Suit, who directs Mass. General's Radiation Oncology\nDepartment and pioneered many of the improvements in proton beam\ntherapy.\n\n   Those are the same sorts of gains oncologists at Mass. General\nare hoping for with another radiation technology being tried on\nbreast cancer patients. Hollow tubes about the size of an\nintravenous line are inserted at half-inch intervals around the\ntumor, then filled with seeds of radioactive iridium, eliminating\nthe need for less precise external beams and taking just five days,\ncompared to six weeks with standard radiation. ``So far all our\npatients are fine, but we're still awaiting final proof in five or\n10 years that it's effective,'' says Dr. Simon Powell, who oversees\nthe implant program.\n\n   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, meanwhile, cancer\nspecialists are trying out another radiation treatment on patients\nwith low-grade lymphomas. Researchers recently developed an\nantibody that targets those tumors, and doctors now are attaching\nto those antibodies a radioactive iodine solution they hope will\nhelp kill cancer cells.\n\n   ``We're trying to find a biological attack point,'' explains Dr.\nLowell Schnipper, the medical center's chief of hematology and\noncology. ``It's the first in a series of strategies that will be\nmore tailored to the tumor itself.''\n\n   That challenge of getting radiation where it can do the most\ngood has preoccupied radiologists ever since Wilhelm Conrad\nRoentgen discovered X-rays in 1895. The latest tack being tried is\ndelivering the radiation during surgery, rather than before or\nafterward.\n\n   With certain spinal tumors, for instance, doctors use a\nseemingly-endless series of CAT scans as a roadmap to delicately\nplant catheters of cancer-fighting radioactive material in the\nspine. The challenge with cancers in the rectum, pancreas, abdomen,\nand pelvis is getting the radiation there without damaging the\nbowel or other tissue that is in the way. The solution: During\nsurgery, after the visible tumor has been removed, the bowel,\nbladder, and other critical organs are manually pushed aside so a\nradioactive beam can zero in on whatever cancer cells remain.\n\n   This ``intraoperative electron beam'' technique was inaugurated\nin 1978, and now is widely used at Mass. General, the M.D. Anderson\nCancer Center in Houston, and other major hospitals, with dramatic\nresults: Recurrence rates of 45 percent for locally-advanced rectal\ncancer have been lowered to 10 percent, and outcomes are equally\ngood for certain sarcomas of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\n   Arthur S. Athanas is one of those remarkable statistics. Two\nyears ago, he had a tumor in his bile duct so difficult to reach\nthat three doctors told him ``they wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot\npole,'' the 78-year-old Athanas recalls. At Mass. General, however,\nsurgeons used a combination of conventional radiation, surgery, and\nthe intra-operative beam to destroy the tumor.\n\n   Today, says Athanas, there is no sign of any cancer and ``I\ndon't have to go in for another checkup for another year.''\n\n     \n   \nSurgery best hope for many cancers\n\n     \n  \n\n   Thirty years ago, when chemotherapy and radiation were in their\ninfancy, surgery was the best hope for most cancer patients. It\nstill is, at least when the cancer hasn't spread.\n\n   That's partly because solid tumors in the liver, lungs, and\nother organs often are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, so\nsurgery often is the only option. It's also because surgeons have\nrefined their techniques, lowering the risks and raising the\nprecision with which they can excise cancerous cells. Most\npromising is the way surgeons are collaborating with colleagues in\nradiation and chemotherapy, using them to shrink tumors before an\noperation and to kill remaining cancer cells afterward.\n\n   The transformation has been dramatic with surgery for cancers of\nthe rectum, as well as those of the head and neck, bones, and\ncartilage. ``Fifteen years ago, if you got a sarcoma involving a\nlimb, it was sacrificed. Now, because of the ability to use\nradiation and drugs after surgery, you can just resect it and spare\nthe limb,'' says Dr. Bruce Chabner, chief medical officer at\nDana-Farber/Partners CancerCare and former head of treatment\nprograms at the NCI.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nFINE-TUNED TREATMENT \n","Text":["\n   AMSTERDAM _ To most cancer doctors, a breast tumor is a poison\nthat must be removed as quickly as possible.\n","\n   But to Dr. Herbert M.
