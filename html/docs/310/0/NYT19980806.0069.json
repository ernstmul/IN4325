To resurrect people you thought were\ndestined to die, you have no idea the feeling that gives you.''\n\n   All America seemed to share the feeling that cancer was beatable\nwhen, on Dec. 23, 1971, President Nixon signed the National Cancer\nAct and launched a war on cancer he said should yield a cure within\nfive years. To a country that had managed to put a man on the moon\ntwo years earlier, anything seemed possible.\n\n   The early signs were encouraging, at least in terms of sheer\nactivity. In the five years after the act was signed, Congress\nappropriated more money for cancer than over the previous 33 years.\nCancer centers were funded across the country, and many of the\ncountry's best scientists were drawn to the field. And there were\nadvances, big ones:      researchers developed powerful techniques for\nhunting down and isolating genes; physicians pioneered ways to save\nthe limbs of young patients with bone cancer; and the US Food and\nDrug Administration approved early anticancer drugs like\ndoxorubicin and cisplatin.\n\n   But on the cancer wards, progress in beating back the deadly\ndisease wasn't happening as quickly as the public, and many\ndoctors, had envisioned. Some of the disappointment came from\nchasing false leads. In the late 1960s and early '70s, many\nscientists were drawn to the idea that viruses caused most cancers.\nIn the early 1980s, they hailed the protein interferon as a cure\nfor everything from cancer to the common cold, which proved too\noptimistic.\n\n   Even more fundamental, and more disturbing, was the growing\nrealization that cancer cells had an uncanny ability to resist\nalmost every drug thrown at them; some even found ways to spit out\ntoxic chemotherapies as fast as they were applied, eventually\nresulting in the death of the patient.\n\n   Then came the insight that cancer was not a single disease, but\n``at least 100 different entities,'' as Dr. Donnall Thomas, Nobel\nlaureate and Seattle-based bone marrow transplant pioneer, puts it.\nMaking progress on one form, such as leukemia, often didn't help\nwith cancer of the lung, bladder, and other organs.\n\n   At the discouraging bottom line were the numbers. Cancer deaths\nrose an average of 0.4 percent per year between 1973 and 1990, and\nthe number of new cases climbed by 1.2 percent a year. Especially\nfrustrating were increases in lung, breast, and prostate cancer and\nthe rising death toll from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanomas.\nThis, doctors and patients agreed, wasn't what was supposed to\nhappen when America declared war on a disease.\n\n   To some, it looked like a medical Vietnam. Critics suggested we\nwere losing the war and needed to radically rethink our strategy,\nfocusing more on prevention and boosting the budget for alternative\ntherapies.\n\n   ``The results of what is now 40 years of focus on treatment have\nbeen seriously disappointing,'' says Dr. John Bailar. Bailar, a\nbiostatistician who chairs the Department of Health Studies at the\nUniversity of Chicago, is a longtime critic of the cancer\nestablishment, and remains unimpressed even with the recent\ndownturn in cancer deaths and incidence. The NCI and its sister\nagencies haven't achieved as much as they should have for the money\nspent, he says, and a lot of what they have achieved has come\nthrough prevention, not treatment.\n\n   But even in the '70s, most cancer doctors believed they were\nmaking progress. While critics suggested that position was designed\nto perpetuate the unprecedented flow of tax dollars for research,\nin retrospect their arguments were compelling. Scientists were\nlearning how the cancer cell differs from normal cells, an\nunderstanding that often was advanced as much through their\nfailures as their successes. And despite the rising overall cancer\ntoll, progress was being made with cancer of the bladder, uterus,\nand ovary; the seemingly relentless increases in rates of other\nimportant cancers would finally reverse in the early 1990s.\n\n   ``I think, personally, that the war on cancer was one of the\ngreatest experiments the US government ever did,'' says DeVita, the\nformer NCI chief. ``The information we have today on molecular\nbiology, on developmental biology, all those things came out of the\ncancer program.''\n\n   That's because the researchers were not narrowly focused on\ncuring cancer. The knowledge fueling today's new cancer therapies\n``is a brilliant vindication of curiosity-driven research,'' says\nRobert Weinberg, a leading cancer scientist at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge.\nThe keys, he adds, were that basic science took precedence over\nimmediate bedside applications, and funding came not just from the\nNCI but from a variety of public and private sources.\n\n     \n   \nIn 1976, `the pieces finally came together'\n\n     \n  \n\n   Although cancer is an ancient disease, researchers didn't\ndiscover its root causes until two decades ago.\n\n   Most Americans remember 1976 for its celebration of the nation's\nbicentennial. But to cancer scientists, it was a watershed year\nbecause, after decades of false starts and wrong turns in seeking\nto unmask the origins of cancer, things suddenly went right.\n\n   As Weinberg put it in a recent book, ``In one stroke, everything\nfell into place. The pieces finally came together.''\n\n   The breakthrough came in the San Francisco laboratory of two\nscientists, Harold Varmus, now the director of the National\nInstitutes of Health, and Dr. J. Michael Bishop, now chancellor of\nthe University of California in San Francisco.
