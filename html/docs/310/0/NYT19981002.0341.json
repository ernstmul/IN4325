Last year, it was\nNatick and Methuen; before that it was Burlington, Springfield,\nWorcester, and Rowley. Fewer than half of the cities and towns in\nthe state with municipal water supplies add fluoride. Fully\none-third of all communities in the United States do not fluoridate\ntheir water, scared off by suggestions that fluoride is a dangerous\ntoxin.\n\n   Can fluoride be toxic if ingested in large amounts? Of course it\ncan. So can salt. But study after study has proven that the amount\nof fluoride added to municipal water supplies presents no health\nrisks.\n\n   In Natick, the issue went to court last year, pitting the town's\nBoard of Selectmen against its Board of Health. The selectmen\nargued that it would infringe on individual liberty to force\ntownspeople to drink fluoridated water. Health officials rejected\nthe report of a local citizens group that linked fluoride to\neverything from brittle bones to cancer as ``a flawed document\ncontaining opinions and conclusions not regarded as scientifically\naccurate.''\n\n   The courts ruled in favor of fluoridation in Natick, but its\nruling had no impact on the debate in the town next door. In\nWayland these days, the Pure Water Committee is squaring off\nagainst Citizens for Better Oral Health. Each group is trying to\ninfluence the results of a referendum on fluoride that will appear\non the Nov. 3 ballot. If turnout for the general election is as\nsparse as it was for the September primary, the odds favor the\nopponents of fluoridation.
