And you probably thought that all\nthose misplaced keys and forgotten names were inevitable _ and\nirreversible _ symptoms of aging.\n\n   Not so fast. New research is showing that it is possible to keep\nyour brain fit and flexible with a little regular exercise and\nstimulation.\n\n   ``Active brain cells produce more brain chemicals which help\nkeep brain cells alive,'' said Lawrence C. Katz, a professor of\nneurobiology at Duke University Medical School in North Carolina.\n\n   But Katz, who promotes a regimen called ``neurobics,'' doesn't\nbelieve you have to read a book a day or master the New York Times\ncrossword puzzle to see benefits.\n\n   While such mental challenges are helpful, they aren't the only\nways to get the brain to branch out and literally build new links\nbetween neurons.\n\n   Try brushing your teeth with the opposite hand. Or take a new\nroute to work. Any exercise that gives your brain a break from the\nroutine is establishing vital new pathways and circuits among brain\ncells. ``The idea is to weave a more dense network of connections\nso if a few fray as you get older, you'll have others to fall back\non,'' said Katz, the co-author of a new book, ``Keep Your Brain\nAlive,'' by Workman Publishing Inc.\n\n   ``It's not to make you able to memorize 30 names in 30 seconds\nbut to keep your brain flexible,'' he said. ``It's kind of like the\nbrain equivalent of taking the stairs instead of the elevator. It's\nnot going to make you a marathon runner but it will help you stay\ntoned up.''\n\n   Dr. Paul Spurgas, the chief of neurosurgery at Ellis Hospital in\nSchenectady, has already seen the anecdotal evidence. ``The\npatients in my practice who read, keep up with the newspapers, they\ntend to be sharper much longer in their lives,'' he said.\n\n   Unfortunately, research has shown that the average American is\nfrittering away much precious mental energy, almost four hours\ndaily, on television _ one of the best ways to make the brain\nflabby.\n\n   ``Your brain is designed to be stimulated by your five senses,''\nsaid Katz, who believes social interactions with other people are\namong the best ways to exercise the brain. ``Planting a garden is\nbrain exercise, watching a video or television show about planting\na garden isn't.''\n\n   As with other types of exercise, it's never too late to start a\nregimen of mental workouts, according to Dr. Gary Bernardini, a\nneurologist at Albany Medical Center.\n\n   Simple activities like tying your shoes a different way, reading\na book, or balancing your checkbook with paper and pencil, instead\nof a calculator, are good places to start.\n\n   ``It's almost like a muscle,'' Bernardini said. ``If you use\nyour brain and your memory, it's going to help as you get older.''\n\n   Just as important, he believes, is maintaining a healthy\nlifestyle to help minimize the risk of brain problems such as\nstroke. ``Control your blood pressure, control your diabetes, stop\nsmoking,'' he said.\n\n       \n\n   (Sylvia Wood can be reached at 518-454-5445 or by electronic\nmail at swood(at)timesunion.com)\n","Headline":"\n      HEALTHY BODIES ALSO NEED BRAINS FITNESS \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You work out and watch your diet, but when was\nthe last time you exercised your brain?\n","\n   If you're like most people, you haven't given your brain much\nthought since you left school.
