Yet no one denies there are con artists, some of whom have been\nprosecuted, found guilty of fraud and sentenced to years in U.S.\nprison. There was also the clinic in the late 1980s whose\ndiagnostic methods couldn't differentiate between human blood and\nchicken and cat blood submitted by a Los Angeles Times reporter.\n\n   It's enough to make queasy even those cancer-resource services\nless than enthusiastic about conventional care. The editors of two\npublications that provide regularly updated information on\npromising alternative treatments _ CanHelp and The Moss Report _\nsay they are currently not recommending any Tijuana clinic.\n\n   ``I don't want to make too blanket a condemnation of the Tijuana\nclinics because occasionally they do glom onto something and hit a\njackpot,'' says Ralph Moss, the author of 11 books on\ncancer-related topics. ``But most make me uneasy _ they succeed\nfirst and foremost as freewheeling capitalistic ventures.''\n\n   To the adventurous cancer patient, Moss and CanHelp editor\nPatrick McGrady recommend Germany's alternative clinics, which,\nsupported by that government's health-care system, charge\nreasonable amounts and reflect the country's state-of-the-art\ntechnology and sophisticated understanding of immunity and cancer.\nTijuana's cancer clinics have been described as a Third World\nversion of the German model.\n\n   Moss acknowledges that his optimism regarding the curative role\nof herbs in cancer treatment, celebrated in his book ``Herbs\nAgainst Cancer,'' has not been borne out and says he would not want\nto encourage cancer patients to forsake better therapies for them.\nHe and many holistic doctors say herbs are best for boosting the\nimmune system and minimizing the side effects of chemotherapy, not\nkilling tumors.\n\n   That is unhappy news for many patients. A Canadian study by Dr.\nEduardo Bruera, now M.D. Anderson's chief of palliative care, found\n75 percent of advanced cancer patients taking alternative treatment\n(along with chemotherapy) were doing so out of hope it would kill\nthe cancer.\n\n   In addition, for patients who want to treat cancer with only\nnatural products because they think that will be easier on their\nbodies, holistic doctors warn that the strongest anti-tumor herbs\nare no picnic either. One, scorpion, is hard to get in the United\nStates because it is so toxic.\n\n   Yet the striking thing about the Tijuana clinics is that despite\nall odds, they flourish. Even when they seem transparently nutty,\nlike the doctor who argues that cancer is usually a misdiagnosis of\nparasites, it is not hard to find a patient who says he or she was\nat death's door until starting the clinic's therapy.\n\n   ``One thing clinics like those in Tijuana often bring is an\nintangible quality, a stimulation of patients' positive beliefs\nthat all doctors should take note of,'' says Caryle Hirschberg, a\nbiochemist whose book ``Remarkable Recovery'' examines mysterious\ncures that defy current medical knowledge and questions why doctors\naren't more curious about them. ``If a doctor gives chemotherapy\nwith enthusiasm, patients will do a lot better than if he or she\ngives it with little chance of doing much.''\n\n   Hirschberg says spontaneous remission, the inexplicable\ndisappearance of a tumor, is more frequent than the oft-cited\nestimation that it occurs once in every 100,000 cases. She says her\nresearch suggests the cases never reported alone are 10- to 25-fold\ngreater than that.\n\n   One place to find such apparent recoveries is an herbal clinic\nknown as Hoxsey, the one Carol Main made the videotape about. In\nthe only peer-reviewed study of the Tijuana clinics published to\ndate, six of 16 advanced-cancer patients at Hoxsey _ including two\nwith lung cancer and two with melanoma, among the nastiest cancers\n_ claimed to be cancer-free five or more years later.\n\n   The clinic, which originated in Dallas before authorities drove\nit out of the United States in the late 1950s, was the subject of\nan award-winning 1987 documentary ``Hoxsey: How Healing Becomes a\nCrime.'' One critic said it did to the American Medical Association\nwhat was done to General Motors by Michael Moore's award-winning\n``Roger & Me,'' the documentary on the effect of the automobile\ncompany's closing of a factory.\n\n   The documentary interviews patients whose doctors told them that\nHoxsey, ``the worst cancer quack of the century,'' would take all\ntheir money. ``How can they?'' replies one. ``You already have.''\nNow ``Hoxsey'' author Ken Ausubel is shopping around a feature-film\nscript on the clinic.\n\n   One Tijuana patient hoping for a remarkable recovery is Jackie\nMorales. A 49-year-old Colorado social worker, she was told in\nJuly, after 19 surgeries and a bone marrow transplant, that her\nStage 3 cancer had become Stage 4, that she had more than 100\ncancerous tumors in the bone, lungs and brain and that she probably\nhad six months to live. Since starting treatments at BioPulse in\nlate October, her brain lesions and lung tumors are gone and the\nbone cancer is down 25 percent.\n\n   ``My attitude is 200 percent better emotionally, physically,\nspiritually,'' said Morales, sweat-drenched but energetic after\nawakening from a coma treatment. ``I don't know how long I'm going\nto be around, but I feel like a different person, I feel like I\nhave dignity again. If I go today, that will be OK. And if I go in\n20 years, that will be better.''\n\n   Tijuana's testimonials are generally dismissed by cancer\nspecialists as random statistical anomalies with no discernible\ncause. But others, interested in determining if there is a way to\nkick-start the healing system, are starting to scour the globe to\nstudy such outcomes.\n\n   Arguing that there are two ways to do research _ locking\nyourself in a laboratory or going out in the world and\ninvestigating what people have done _ those researchers say they\nwant to find clinics whose records demonstrate clusters of a dozen\nor more ``exceptional positive outcomes'' in cancers that were not\nexpected to respond.\n\n   At the very least, they argue, such therapies can be improved\nupon by cancer-industry researchers, as has been the case\nhistorically. A quarter of chemotherapy drugs, for instance, were\nderived from herbs, including etoposide, a favorite remedy of\n19th-century alternative doctors.\n\n   What's clear is that few conventional doctors are knowledgeable\nabout the alternatives that cancer patients are pursuing.
