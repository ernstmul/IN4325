STICKNEY JR. \nc.1999 Houston Chronicle \n \n\n   Houston Comets guard Kim Perrot, whose fighting spirit and\ntender heart inspired cheers in times of triumph and prayers as she\nstruggled for her life, died Thursday afternoon, ending her\nsix-month battle with brain and lung cancer.\n\n   She was 32.\n\n   Perrot came to Houston in 1997, a shy woman who at 5 feet 5\ninches tall was given little chance of making the Houston Comets'\n10-player roster during the inaugural season of the Women's\nNational Basketball Association.\n\n   Not only did she endure, she led the Comets to two WNBA\nchampionships as the team's emotional leader. After she was\ndiagnosed with cancer earlier this year, the on-court firebrand\nbecame a cheery, tireless spokeswoman for construction of Kim's\nPlace, a residential facility for children suffering from\nlife-threatening illnesses.\n\n   Friends and family promise that dream will endure in the wake of\nPerrot's death shortly before 3 p.m. CDT Thursday at M.D. Anderson\nCancer Center in Houston.\n\n   ``Kim was an inspiration to each of us, and she touched all of\nour lives in so many ways,'' the Perrot family said in a statement\nreleased by the Comets. ``We will always love her and cherish her\nin our heart, and we know that each of you will, too.''\n\n   Among those at the bedside was Perrot's closest friend on the\nComets, Cynthia Cooper. The rest of the team received word of her\ndeath after arriving in Los Angeles, where the Comets will play the\nLos Angeles Sparks on Friday.\n\n   Comets coach Van Chancellor said he has lost his best friend, a\nwoman who was as close to him as a daughter and a player who, when\nthe coach's words failed, could move her teammates to greatness.\n\n   ``When things went bad, Kim was the person who held this team\ntogether,'' Chancellor said. ``She leaves a void in my life that\ncan never be filled. How do you lose someone you loved so much?''\n\n   WNBA President Val Ackerman said, ``The entire WNBA family is\ndevastated by this tragic loss. We will always remember Kim as a\nwoman of great heart and indomitable courage who refused to be\ndaunted by any challenge.''\n\n   Perrot had spent much of the past month in Tijuana, Mexico,\nreceiving alternative treatment for lung cancer that had spread to\nher brain. But her condition worsened, and she was flown back to\nHouston early Sunday morning.\n\n   Perrot received word of the cancer diagnosis Feb. 19. It was a\nbolt from the blue for Perrot, a nonsmoker and the most physically\nfit member of the Comets.\n\n   A few weeks later, during an emotional news conference at the\nComets' Westside Tennis Club practice center, Perrot clutched at\nthe hand of Chancellor, her friend, father figure and coach, and\nfought back tears as she disclosed her condition.\n\n   ``I've been a fighter all my life,'' she said. ``This is just\nanother fight, and I'm going to win this one, too.''\n\n   Three days later at M.D. Anderson, Perrot underwent surgery to\nremove a golf-ball-sized tumor from her brain. Four smaller tumors\nalso were found in her brain.\n\n   Perrot also had advanced alveolar adenocarcinoma, which accounts\nfor only 2 percent to 4 percent of lung cancer cases but is the\nmost common form of lung cancer in nonsmokers.\n\n   In cases such as Perrot's, when tumors spread to the brain, the\ncancer is ``virtually incurable,'' said Garrett Lynch, acting chief\nof oncology at Baylor College of Medicine. Average survival is\nthree to six months, and only 15 percent of patients survive one\nyear.\n\n   Though chemotherapy was offered as an option, Perrot chose\ninstead to travel to Tijuana for alternative treatment. The family\nhas declined to discuss details of the treatment.\n\n   Lynch said patients sometimes seek alternative therapies in\nMexico such as shark cartilage, laetrile (an extract from apricot\npits purported to cause regression of cancer), vitamins and herbs.\nLynch said laetrile was not shown to be effective in a National\nCancer Institute study. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of\nshark cartilage are ongoing.\n\n   Despite her illness, Perrot once again became a familiar face at\nComets practices and games early this season. On June 18 at Compaq\nCenter, she received her 1998 WNBA championship ring from\nChancellor and Rockets executive Carroll Dawson. She felt strong\nenough six days later to travel with the team on a two-game trip to\nDetroit and Washington, D.C.\n\n   But after a day and a half in Detroit, Perrot flew back to\nHouston because of ``job-related business,'' she said. Over the\nnext month, her visits to the Comets became far less frequent and\nof shorter duration.\n\n   But Perrot was at Compaq Center on July 11 when the Comets\nhosted the Sacramento Monarchs. The Comets built a 23-point\nfirst-half lead, then began to wither in the second half.\n\n   ``During one timeout,'' said Chancellor, ``she came into the\nhuddle behind me, and I didn't even see her, didn't know she was\nthere.\n\n   ``She said to me, `Coach, you know I love you.'''\n\n   While the Comets held on for a five-point victory, the lingering\nmemory for Chancellor was not the win, but Perrot's words. He burst\ninto tears while recounting them earlier this week.\n\n   A month ago, Perrot returned to Tijuana. Cooper said she planned\nto return to Houston in mid-August to begin chemotherapy. During\nthe first week of August, however, Cooper was summoned to Tijuana.\n\n   ``She's OK,'' Cooper said, ``but she's finding the fight a\nlittle tougher than she expected.''\n\n   On Aug. 12, the Comets were told Perrot had taken a turn for the\nworse. Team owner Leslie Alexander arranged for her to be flown to\nHouston and for her family to join her.\n\n   A graduate of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette, Perrot was a\nmember of the U.S. national team in 1989 and 1990. She scored 58\npoints in a game against Southeastern Louisiana, the second-highest\nsingle-game total in NCAA history, and she led the nation in\nscoring her senior year with an average of 30.1 points per game.\n\n   After playing professional basketball for six seasons in Sweden,\nGermany, Israel and France, she was invited to try out for the\nnewly formed WNBA in 1997. Chancellor fondly recalls her as being\n``the 58th player on a 55-player roster.''\n\n   ``She had no chance of making our team,'' Chancellor said.\n``None. But she proved everybody wrong.\n\n   ``That's the type of person Kim Perrot is. She was the most\nlovable person you'd ever want to meet, but put a challenge in\nfront of her, and she'd fight you tooth and nail.''\n\n   The nuts and bolts of Perrot's career _ 7.2 points per game, 230\nassists and 153 steals _ were overshadowed by her leadership and\nher impact on those she met in hundreds of public appearances\naround the city.\n\n   ``She got up every day having to prove herself being 5-5, and\nshe overcame more things. It made her tough,'' said the Rockets'\nDawson. ``I believed in everything she said she was going to do.\nShe was an extraordinary person.\n\n   ``I probably talk to as many people a day in my job as anybody.\nIt's always before business starts: `How's Kim doing?' She touched\na lot of people. The world's not as good as it was before 3\no'clock.''\n\n     \n   \n(STORY CAN END HERE.
