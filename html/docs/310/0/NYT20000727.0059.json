GLASS\n      c.2000 Cox News Service\n\n   NEW YORK _ On a summer day 32 years ago, the late Jacob Javits,\nseeking to catch a shuttle to Washington for a key Senate vote, got\na ride to New York's LaGuardia Airport in his law partner's plush\nlimo.\n\n   The car came with a radio telephone which accessed the 30\nchannels then available throughout New York City for public use. On\nJavits' behest, I waited until one of 30 red lights finally turned\ngreen and then asked the mobile operator to connect us with an\nairline dispatcher. They held the plane.\n\n   Those overburdened 30 channels came to mind the other day while\nI stood in front of the Yale Club of New York, around the corner\nfrom the old Hotel Roosevelt, where I had served as Javits'\ncampaign press secretary in 1968.\n\n   Before pulling up, I called a Manhattan garage from the Lincoln\nTunnel on my car's mobile phone. In waiting some five minutes for\nthe valet attendant to show up, 45 people had walked by on that\nbusy sidewalk talking on their cell phones.\n\n   Nowadays, it's become common at congressional hearings to ask\nfolks to turn off their pagers before paging the first witness.\nSome trendy Manhattan eateries have taken to asking patrons for\ntheir cell phone preference _ on or off. No longer does the maitre\nd' come by to plug in celebrity diners.\n\n   The mobile phone scene has changed since 1984, when an attorney\nfriend told me that he would be getting a car phone in return for\nhaving done legal work for a pioneering telecom provider. In time,\nhe passed up that swap. But I bought a phone, to the surprise of\ndinner hosts who directed us into their unmarked cul-de-sacs.\n\n   Within a year or so, that single-antenna firm had gone belly up\nbecause, as it turned out, cell phones were the way to go. So I\nswitched to a $950 Motorola model, becoming one of the first\n200,000 subscribers in the country to do so.\n\n   The other day, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry\nAssociation announced the anonymous arrival of the nation's 100\nmillionth wireless subscriber. This rapid mobile growth, the\nindustry trade group reported, isn't expected to stop, or even slow\ndown, anytime soon.\n\n   With 36 percent of the U.S. population already gone wireless,\nusage continues to grow at the rate of 67,082 new subscribers each\nday, which works out to a new subscriber every 1.3 seconds.\n\n   It took 16 years to get to 100 million mobile users. By\ncontrast, it took 54 years for TV sets to reach 100 million\nhouseholds; it took cars 68 years to reach 100 million parking\nspaces, and it took 91 years for telephone land lines to reach 100\nmillion customers.\n\n   It's gotten to where cell phones even provide column fodder for\nsuch renowned pundits as William Safire of The New York Times.\nSafire recently keyboarded a column on behalf of beleaguered folks\nwho do not ``wish to hear any of their tidbits or their stock\ntrading results that they discuss over their little wireless\nphones.''\n\n   Safire rarely employs e-mail and never uses his cell phone while\ncrossing the street.
