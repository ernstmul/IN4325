But most\ncancers arise when genes are disrupted by chemicals, radiation,\ndietary factors, or the aging process itself.\n\n   Since that singular discovery _ for which Varmus and Bishop won\nthe Nobel Prize in 1989 _ scores of oncogenes have been discovered.\nAnd in 1983, another important type of gene came to light. These\ntumor suppressor genes normally keep a lid on overly-zealous cell\ngrowth, but when they are mutated or missing, they allow cells to\ndivide rapidly and endlessly.\n\n   What all those discoveries mean is that today, scientists know\nthat the human cell is controlled by a highly-complex set of\ngenetic signals that normally let cells grow and divide in an\norderly way as they replace other cells or repair the body. Cancer\nis what happens when that control system breaks down or has missing\nparts. Then, like a car with a stuck accelerator or no brakes, the\nnormal cell evolves into a rapidly dividing tumor cell that escapes\nregulation and spawns millions or billions of similarly renegade\noffspring.\n\n   With this detailed picture of cancer in hand, scientists have\nforged a new set of weapons.\n\n   ``We've finally gotten a handle on a variety of genetic events\nwithin the tumor and events associated with the development of\ncancers, (and now we can) intervene and block those signals or\nmolecular events to interfere with the progression of cancer,''\nsays Samuel Waksal, chief executive officer of ImClone Systems in\nNew York, a biotech company that is developing sophisticated new\ncancer drugs.\n\n   In fact, scores of new drugs are pouring from pharmaceutical and\nbiotech companies, each aimed at a specific link in the Rube\nGoldberg-like chain of events that turns cells cancerous.\n\n   Some of those medications, like the nearly two dozen\n``angiogenesis inhibitors'' based on research by Harvard's Folkman\nand others, aren't aimed at the cancer cell at all. Instead, they\nseek to destroy the network of tiny blood vessels that surround and\nsupport growing tumors. And because the cancer cell doesn't ``see''\nthe attack, it can't plot an escape plan.\n\n   Folkman's most potent anti-angiogenesis drugs, endostatin and\nangiostatin, got a huge media bounce this spring even though they\naren't ready for human tests. The enthusiastic stories misleadingly\nspoke of a ``cure'' and ``brought premature attention a little\nearlier than people in the field wanted,'' Folkman said in a recent\ninterview. They also raised expectations to unrealistic levels,\nalthough Folkman remains optimistic the drugs will prove effective\nin people.\n\n   Klausner, the NCI chief, is also optimistic about many of the\nnew therapies. ``I recognize that most of the ideas we test will\nnot work out, or we'll have to worm our way through a long\ndiscovery process,'' he says. ``But it's very reasonable to be\nexcited and hopeful about the significant increase, maybe even an\nexponential increase, in the number of ideas.... It's so hard to\ndescribe how important that is.''\n\n   Other researchers are more cautious. One enormous obstacle, they\nsay, is that tumors are made up of many types of cancer cells,\npossibly requiring attacks by combinations of several agents. They\nalso worry that the new biologic drugs are hard to make and\nexpensive to take.\n\n   ``What we've learned over the years,'' says Dr. Howard Fine, who\nis trying angiogenesis inhibitors in brain tumor patients at the\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute, ``is that cancer cells are smarter\nthan we are.''\n\n     \n   \nLots of progress, but cure is still elusive\n\n     \n  \n\n   Americans have been emotionally and financially backing the\nbattle against the wily cancer cell for 27 years. Now they're being\ntold that, while there is clear-cut progress, an out-and-out cure\nmay never come. All of which raises the question: Does the nation\nhave the resolve to keep going?\n\n   Public opinion polls suggest it does, in a big way. Eighty-four\npercent of Americans think there will be a cure for cancer in the\nnext 50 years, and 64 percent are confident it will happen within a\ndecade, according to a nationwide Gallup survey conducted in May.\nIn another Gallup poll last fall, respondents ranked cancer as\nAmerica's second most urgent health problem, tied with rising\nmedical costs and trailing only AIDS.\n\n   Washington seems equally committed, even congressional\nRepublicans normally wary of expensive federal programs. While\nPresident Clinton has called for a 50- percent hike in funding for\nthe NIH and NCI over the next five years, Congress seems determined\nto spend even more.\n\n   ``The Congress is, I think, poised to double funding for NIH\nover a five-year period,'' says Representative John Porter, an\nIllinois Republican who chairs the House Appropriations\nsubcommittee that oversees funding for medical research. On the\nDemocratic side of the aisle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of\nMassachusetts, an architect of the 1971 National Cancer Act, is\nequally determined: ``I'm strongly in favor of doubling the NIH\nbudget now.''\n\n   Even with that resolve, and with evidence that death rates are\ndeclining, more than 1,500 Americans will die of cancer every day\nthis year. And the millions more who are suffering from the disease\nare determined to know what's available now, as well as what's\nhappening in the laboratory.\n\n   ``Until the day you're diagnosed with cancer, you have no reason\nto wonder whether or not what the scientists are saying is true,''\nsays Laurel Simmons of Cambridge, a graduate student in public\nhealth who was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1987,\nbut is symptom-free today.\n\n   ``When you are diagnosed,'' she adds, ``they tell you what your\nchances of getting out of the hospital alive are. And one of the\nfirst things people do, in a variety of ways, is confront the\npossibility of their death.''\n\n    \n\n      One way cancer clinicians are trying to reduce such\npossibilities is by using their new understanding of how the cancer\ncell works to alter the diet, adjust workplace conditions, clean up\nenvironmental carcinogens, change dangerous habits like smoking,\nand take other steps to prevent cancer. ``The deep understanding of\nthe genetics of cancer development in cells that lead them to\nbecome cancer may well have its most profound effect on prevention,\nultimately, rather than on treatment,'' says Klausner.\n\n   Armed with that and other new weapons, America and its leaders\nseem determined to recommit the country to the war on cancer that\nthey launched 27 years ago.\n\n   ``I have no problem thinking about it as a war,'' says Varmus,\nthe NIH chief. ``The problem is, there's not going to be a day of\nsurrender.
