But there are\nno American Indians here. The Lemhi Shoshone, living links to the\nteenage girl who was instrumental in leading the Corps of Discovery\nover the continental divide in 1805, have been all but erased from\nthis place they have called home for hundreds of years.

Environmentalists are keenly interested in Antarctica\nbecause of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which\ncontains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the\nsea. If just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _\nshould do this, global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17\nfeet, inundating coastal regions everywhere with catastrophic\nconsequences for humanity.

A\nreconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are\nnegroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may\nhave initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by a\npeople distinct from the ancestors of today's Amerindians.

According\nto the theory, the deep sadness in severe depression, the hand\nwringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears\nof tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the\nshaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the\nsame basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that\nnormally fire their cells in synchrony.

Hospitals may not be\ncalled pest houses anymore, but they are still terrible places to\nbe sick. They are all crawling with bacteria, with strangers who\nare sometimes kindly but sometimes not, with the potential for bad\naccidents; hospitals assault the senses from every direction, and\nthen they send a bill.
