Times News Service   \n\n   DETROIT _ Want to form a closer bond with your car? You could\ntalk to it _ and before long, you may find it is listening.\n\n   The Jaguar S-Type sedan, a 2000 model due to arrive in dealer\nshowrooms in May, will use speech recognition technology more\nextensively than any car yet. With simple spoken commands, the\nS-Type driver will be able to make calls on the cellular telephone,\nchange the radio station, play a compact disk or a cassette tape\nand adjust the heating and air-conditioning. The Jaguar system\nallows 44 commands in all.\n\n   Experts say this is only the beginning. After years of\nunfulfilled promises, speech recognition, which converts sounds\ninto numeric equivalents that are matched against a memory bank of\nnumbers that correspond to words, is catching on in the auto\nindustry.\n\n   Already, it is becoming more widely used in telecommunications,\npackage shipping, stock trading and other businesses. Technological\nbreakthroughs with microprocessors and speech-recognition software\nhave vastly improved the performance of the systems and drastically\nreduced their costs, making them more feasible in an industry where\nevery nickel counts.  \n\n   The Jaguar system is optional on S-Types in Britain, costing\nbuyers about $700 extra. The option has not yet been priced for the\nAmerican market; the S-Type is expected to sell here in the $40,000\nrange.\n\n   For the United States, the system will be programmed to\nunderstand American accents; buyers also will be able to add\ncommands in their own speech, an aid for those with thick or\nunusual accents.\n\n   Jaguar is not alone in its use of speech recognition, and all\nthe leading vehicle manufacturers are exploring uses for the\ntechnology. Lexus, the luxury car division of Toyota, has offered\nspeech recognition with the cellular telephone in its flagship LS\n400 sedan since 1993. The next generation of that $50,000 car is\nlikely to have more speech-recognition functions.\n\n   The Onstar communications and navigation system, offered on some\nmodels from the General Motors Corp., includes a hands-free phone\nthat dials numbers on command _ as, for instance, when told to\n``Phone home'' or ``Dial 888-234-5678.''\n\n   The all-new Mercedes-Benz S-Class for 2000, which comes out in\nthe spring, has a voice-activated cellular phone.\n\n   A number of recent concept cars, which are showcases for\nmanufacturers' design and technical prowess, have shown how far\nspeech-recognition technology can be expanded. The Jaguar system\nwas developed by the Ford Motor Co.'s giant parts-making affiliate,\nVisteon Corp. A year ago at the Society of Automotive Engineers\nexposition in Detroit, Visteon demonstrated a speech-recognition\nsystem that could read e-mail or stock quotes at a driver's\nrequest.\n\n   GM's equivalent parts operation, Delphi Automotive Systems, has\ndeveloped a Network Vehicle concept car that also calls up e-mail\nor stock quotes. It further uses speech recognition to operate a\nDirecTV satellite receiver and cellular phones.\n\n   The audio and climate controls of the Buick Cielo, a concept car\nshown last month at the North American International Auto Show in\nDetroit, also respond to spoken commands, but the Cielo can do even\nmore: Tell its doors to open, and they do. Ask its roof to retract,\nand the sun shines in.\n\n   DaimlerChrysler plans to add speech recognition to another\nconcept vehicle that made its debut at the Detroit show, the Jeep\nCommander. If spoken to, its detachable computer, which has\nInternet access, will read and write e-mail messages.\n\n   Speech recognition is particularly attractive to auto makers\nbecause of safety concerns over drivers' use of cellular phones and\nnavigation systems. Engineers are looking for technologies that can\nallow drivers to continue using phones and electronic navigation\naids without taking their hands off the wheel and their eyes off\nthe road.\n\n   ``When the person in the car is busy doing things other than\ndriving, safety becomes paramount,'' said Jeff Owens, general\ndirector of engineering for Delphi Delco Electronics Systems in\nKokomo, Ind.  \n\n   In addition, car buyers are demanding more comfort, convenience\nand communications functions in their vehicles as they use them as\nmobile offices. Experts predict that in the not-too-distant future,\ncars will be equipped with Internet access to allow drivers to send\nand retrieve e-mail, hear live traffic reports or pick up stock\nquotes.\n\n   ``The amount of information flowing into the car is demanding we\nfind safer and more user-friendly ways to take the physical\nmanipulation out of the equation,'' Owens said.  \n\n   Speech recognition has the advantage of allowing simple voice\ncommands to replace multiple functions, said Bob Prew, principal\nengineer and project coordinator for the S-Type. To replicate a\ncommand like ``Play CD, disk 4, track 7,'' would take five or six\npushes of buttons or turns of knobs.\n\n   In addition, the extra knobs, buttons and levers needed to\nhandle all of a car's new functions are competing for a limited\namount of valuable real estate in the interior. Speech recognition\ncan help to clean up cluttered dashboards and give designers more\nfreedom.  \n\n   ``If you can tuck some of the systems away you have more design\nfreedom,'' said Bharat Patel, principal engineer for driver\ninformation systems at Jaguar Cars in Coventry, England. ``You\ndon't have to make the telephone accessible, for instance.''  \n\n   Automotive experts predict that speech-recognition in cars _ and\nwith computers generally _ will eventually move beyond simple voice\ncommands like ``phone home'' and allow continuous speech. But that\ncould take years. Continuous speech recognition is especially\nchallenging in a car; the automotive environment tends to be far\nmore noisy than an office or a home.\n\n   In addition, auto manufacturers are global and sell in diverse\nmarkets.
