And contrary to the findings of famed sex\nresearchers Masters and Johnson, the uterus does not double in size\nduring intercourse; in fact, it hardly changes at all.\n\n   ``This is basic science,'' says Weijmar Schultz. ``Based on this\nknowledge, doctors and sexologists can better understand their\npatients' problems and find new ways of therapy.''\n\n     GENETIC CODE BREAKER     \n\n   When the Human Genome Project began in 1990, scientists expected\nit would take 15 years to produce a blueprint of our DNA. But\nvastly improved computers and software sped the task: By the end of\nthis spring, researchers predict, their map will be 90 percent\ncomplete.\n\n   Francis Collins, one of the project's chief researchers, shares\nhis thoughts on cracking the human genetic code.\n\n     Q:    Why does it matter if we know the sequences of our 46\nchromosomes?\n\n     A:    This is the instruction book for human biology. Everything\nwe do _ from the time we are a one-celled embryo until adulthood _\nand all the ways we fight off diseases or fall victim to them will\nbe illuminated by understanding these instructions.\n\n   For example, there are probably half a million folks in the\nUnited States who are at risk for colon cancer because they've\ninherited a mutation in a DNA repair gene. Now we can identify\nthose who have this mutation and get them into a medical\nsurveillance program as early as age 25.\n\n     Q:    Does isolating a genetic defect make it easier to cure the\ndisease?\n\n     A:    Finding the cystic fibrosis gene in 1989 has not yet led to\na cure. But we've learned a huge amount about the normal function\nof that gene and how you might compensate for its lack of function.\n\n   There are about two dozen new drugs in clinical trials, most of\nwhich would never have been thought of without the gene in hand.\n\n     Q:    How many of us bear gene mutations for deadly diseases?\n\n     A:    We all carry about four or five lethal recessive genes. If\nboth parents carried the same recessive gene and they both passed\nit on to a child, that would produce a lethal disease. And we all\nwalk around with 30 or 40 DNA variants that convey a risk for\nailments like diabetes, heart disease, cancer or schizophrenia.\n\n     Q:    Could insurance companies use this information to refuse\ncoverage for high-risk carriers?\n\n     A:    Both parties in both houses of Congress and the president\nof the United States have publicly said we need legislation that\nmakes it illegal for a health-insurance company to use genetic\ninformation to set premiums or to deny coverage. We just haven't\nseen it happen yet.\n\n     Q:    Has your work as a geneticist ever conflicted with your\nfaith?\n\n     A:    No. For me, being involved in the genome project seems\nilluminated by faith. As someone who believes in a personal God, I\nfind that the opportunity to uncover some of the mysteries of human\nbiology is also an opportunity for worship.\n\n     THE BIRD ON THE PLAIN FLIES MAINLY WITH THE BRAIN     \n\n   With accuracy rivaling that of piloted airplanes, homing pigeons\nnavigate thousands of miles of flight. Nobody knows their secret _\nit is almost as if they are reading a map.\n\n   That may be exactly what they are doing, says geophysicist Jon\nHagstrum of the United States Geological Survey. He believes the\nbirds recognize landscapes by sensing infrasound, or very low\nfrequency sound.\n\n   Waterfalls, meteors, ocean waves and winds whistling over\nmountains or through tunnels all generate distinctive washes of\ninfrasound. Lab experiments show that pigeons are sensitive to such\nlow frequencies, but results do not reveal why.\n\n   Hagstrum claims that pigeons use the deep noises to build up\nelaborate mental topographic maps. Hagstrum looked at records of\ncarrier-pigeon races, in which thousands of birds are released all\nat once. Four races stood out because the birds returned hopelessly\nlate or not at all. Each of these events coincided with nearby\nflights of the Concorde.\n\n   The correlation led Hagstrum to the idea that sonic booms from\nthe plane temporarily deafened the birds, knocking out a natural\nability to picture and map the landscape in infrasound.
