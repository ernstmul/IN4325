Why is it that we can hear FM radio when going through a\ntunnel, but we can't hear AM radio?\n\n   L.R., Duxbury, Mass.\n\n   A. In short, says Mark Manuelian, engineering manager at WBZ\nradio in Boston, it's because AM radio waves are too big. They\ndon't fit into tunnels. FM waves do.\n\n   Manuelian says a simple way to envision this phenomenon is by\nthe example of the pipe organ. The fat pipes that make low notes\ncreate a wide wiggling acoustic wave for _ say, low C. But imagine\nthat as that big fat low C wave comes out the top of the pipe,\ninstead of spilling out into the church or concert hall, it tries\nto travel up into a tiny little pipe right above it fitted for high\nC. The `fat' wave won't fit into it. It weakens and dies.\n\n   Of course, acoustic wave physics are much more complex than\nthat. But if you think of an AM radio wave as too wide to fit into\nthe opening of a tunnel, you've got the basic idea.\n\n   The size of a radio wave, its wavelength, is measured from wave\npeak to wave peak. AM radio waves average 1,000 feet. The average\nFM wavelength is only 10 feet. (Frequency is a measure of how many\ncycles pass by a given spot in one second.)\n\n   FM has trouble with tunnels too. Even though they can fit into\nthe opening of the tunnel, the FM waves bounce off the walls and\nvehicles in the tunnel, and each bounce robs them of some of their\nenergy. That's why FM fades the deeper into the tunnel you get.\n\n   The size of AM and FM waves explains some other differences you\nmay have noticed. FM is stronger inside buildings with steel\nframes, because those little ten-foot waves can fit between the\nsteel beams. AM waves are too big. Parts of them can make it\nthrough, but they're badly attenuated . . . weakened.\n\n    \n\n   Q. Why does where I stand in my room affect my FM reception?\n\n   M.L., Boston\n\n   A. This phenomenon is called multipath. After a radio signal\nleaves the transmitter, it starts hitting metal everywhere and\nbouncing around. Your radio is actually receiving the signal from\nlots of directions.\n\n   The signal has no trouble passing through non-conducting\nmaterials like wood and glass. But the human body, made of so much\nsalty water, is a good conductor. As you move around in the room,\nyou interfere with some of the multiple signals coming in from\noutside.\n\n   But you only deflect a signal that's the right size: FM. From\npeak to trough, half a cycle, an average FM wave is only five feet.\nA person five feet tall is enough to interfere with a wave that\nsize. But we don't make much of a dent in a 1,000-foot AM wave,\nmost of which still gets to the radio.\n\n    \n\n   (Readers are invited to send science questions to How&Why.
