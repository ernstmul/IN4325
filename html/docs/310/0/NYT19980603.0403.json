Times News Service  \n \n\n   NEW YORK _ Wednesday morning at Giants Stadium, Giants Coach Jim\nFassel gathered his players around him as he always does at the\nconclusion of practice, but on this occasion, Fassel did not\ndiscuss football.\n\n   With most players on one knee, Fassel led the team in prayer for\nrunning back LeShon Johnson, a recent free-agent acquisition, who\nWednesday received a diagnosis of lymphoma, a form of cancer. Team\ndoctors detected an abnormality after a routine chest X-ray last\nmonth and, in subsequent tests, determined that Johnson, 27, had a\ncancerous tumor.\n\n   The Giants declined to reveal the course of treatment Johnson\nwould receive in the coming weeks, but team officials said\nprivately that the preliminary opinion of Johnson's doctors was\nthat he would receive radiation treatments and that the prognosis\nfor a full recovery was good. He is not expected to have surgery. A\nteam doctor added that the cancer was discovered at an early stage.\n\n   ``My doctors tell me we have a good chance to cure this,''\nJohnson said in a statement released by the team. ``My family and I\nbelieve that with the help of the doctors and with the strength of\nour faith in God, we will get through this and I will be back on\nthe field in 1998.''\n\n   Johnson signed a free-agent contract with the Giants on March 10\nand worked out regularly at Giants Stadium thereafter. There were\nno symptoms of his cancer, Fassel said. Johnson participated fully\nin the three-day minicamp May 4-6, a week after he had been\nmarried. He and his wife, Nalani, have a 5-month-old son.\n\n   Johnson, the team noted Wednesday, had a chest X-ray last year\nas a member of the Arizona Cardinals.\n\n   ``There was nothing unusual on that X-ray then,'' Giants General\nManager Ernie Accorsi said. ``The doctors have told us they are\noptimistic they can contain this.''\n\n   Johnson will be treated by Dr. David Wolf, a hematology\noncologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.\n\n   Giants coaches and executives were reluctant to answer questions\nabout Johnson's football future.\n\n   ``Our concern is his health and that he gets the best possible\ntreatment,'' said Fassel, who coached Johnson in 1996 when he was\nthe offensive coordinator in Arizona.\n\n   Other team officials who asked not to be identified said that\nwhile Johnson's chances of a full recovery were excellent, it\nappeared unlikely that he would return to play this season.\n\n   In August 1987, Karl Nelson was a star offensive lineman for the\nGiants when he received a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease, a type of\nlymphoma. He missed the 1987 season and returned to play in 1988\nbefore there was a recurrence of his cancer. Free of the disease\nsince 1989, Nelson retired to a career as a broadcaster and\ninsurance executive.\n\n   The Giants have contacted Nelson, who was also treated by Wolf,\nto enlist his aid in Johnson's treatment and recovery. ``I talk to\na lot of people who are going through this,'' Nelson said\nWednesday. ``The important thing for LeShon is that he stay\nmentally tough and positive. Generally, athletes can do that\nbetter. They are used to fighting through things _ dealing with\nthings when you are physically and mentally tired.''\n\n   Although Johnson has been with the team fewer than three months,\nhe becomes the fifth active Giants player to have cancer in the\nlast 18 years. Dan Lloyd, a linebacker, had lymphatic cancer in\n1980 and recovered. Running back Doug Kotar died in 1983 of a brain\ntumor. John Tuggle, also a running back, died of cancer in 1986.\n\n   After Tuggle's death, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition\nAuthority financed a study of the Meadowlands complex and nearly\n10,000 current and former employees there. The study found there\nwas no conclusive link between the Giants Stadium environment and\ncancer.\n\n   ``I'm sure that's one of the first things people said,'' Nelson\nsaid. ``The Giants and cancer. But LeShon just got here.''\n\n   When the team convened this week for a passing camp at Giants\nStadium, Johnson attended but was not in uniform as he awaited the\nresults of a biopsy.
