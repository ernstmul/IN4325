Times News Service   \n\n   As scientists look back at all the discoveries made in the\n1990s, the so-called Decade of the Brain, one finding stands out as\nthe most startling and, for many scientists, the most difficult to\naccept: people are not necessarily born with all the brain cells\nthey will ever have.\n\n   In fact, from birth through late adolescence, the brain appears\nto add billions of new cells, literally constructing its circuits\nout of freshly made neurons as children and teen-agers interact\nwith their environments.\n\n   In adulthood, the process of adding new cells slows down but\ndoes not stop. Mature circuits appear to be maintained by new cell\ngrowth well into old age.\n\n   Although the congressionally mandated ``decade'' produced many\nother discoveries, from ways to obtain images of fleeting thoughts\ninside a person's head to new drugs for a wide variety of mental\ndisorders, the finding that the brain develops and maintains itself\nby adding new cells is the most revolutionary.\n\n   If these findings hold up to further scrutiny, the next decade\nof brain research promises to generate a total revision of how\nscientists think human minds are organized and constructed.\n\n   Findings have already shed new light on mechanisms of learning,\nmemory and aging in normal brains and suggest daring new ways to\ntreat strokes and other brain disorders. Moreover, they may provide\nsolutions to some abiding mysteries _ including the way young\nchildren who have half their brains surgically removed to treat\nsevere epilepsy go on to develop normally, as if they had whole\nbrains in half the usual amount of space.\n\n   Some researchers have begun isolating special cells that\ncontinue to divide and produce new brain tissue, with the hope of\nimplanting such cells into areas of the brain that are damaged by\ndisease or accidents.\n\n   For decades, it was axiomatic that people were born with all the\nbrain cells they would ever have. Unlike the bones, the skin, the\nblood vessels and other body parts, where cells divide throughout\nlife to give rise to new cells, it was believed that the brain did\nnot renew itself.\n\n   Though the brain did add vast amounts of new connections early\nin life and could compensate somewhat for many injuries, it was\nthought that no one could be expected to grow more brain cells with\nage. Quite the opposite. People were told that the only thing they\ncould look forward to was gradual mental deterioration as cells\ndied off and were never replenished.\n\n   These ideas were so firmly established that many scientists have\na hard time believing the findings, reported in the last couple of\nyears by a number of investigators, that the human brain makes new\ncells after birth, said Dr. Fred H. Gage, a neuroscientist at the\nSalk Institute in La Jolla, Calif.\n\n   Even when they accept the idea that such cells may exist, they\nargue there is no proof that they do anything important, he said.\nAnd those skeptical of the new developments, like Dr. Pasko Rakic,\na neuroscientist at Yale, say that if scientists expect others to\nchange longstanding thinking about brain development, the standard\nof proof must be set very high.\n\n   Dr. Per Andersen, a neurobiologist at the University of Oslo in\nNorway, said neuroscientists had responded to several of the new\nfindings with ``resounding silence.'' This is probably not because\nof ``active neglect,'' he said, but ``it takes some time to let\nunexpected results sink down in the mutual consciousness of\nneurobiologists.'' In short, the new findings are simply too\nstartling and revolutionary to digest all at once.\n\n   Dr. Morten Raastad, also from Oslo, compared resistance to the\nidea of brains' growing new cells to the way scientists once\nresisted the idea of plate tectonics and continental drift. The\ntheory was first proposed in 1915, but it was not until scientists\ncompleted sea-floor magnetism studies in the 1960s that it was\naccepted, he said.\n\n   The traditional view of human brain development is based on\nexperiments done in the mid-1960s on macaque monkeys by Rakic. He\nsaid then that based on available techniques for detecting dividing\ncells in brain tissue there was no evidence that new cells were\nbeing born in the monkey brain. He and others inferred this must be\ntrue of all primates, including humans.\n\n   According to this theory, brains grow as new connecting fibers,\ncalled synapses and dendrites, proliferate around a fixed number of\nbrain cells after birth. Cells not connected into circuits through\nthese growing fibers would die off.\n\n   Thus brains develop by pruning and sculpturing, not by building\nnetworks with billions of new cells, Rakic and others theorized.\n\n   The fact that many people do not recover the ability to speak or\nwalk after having strokes or other traumatic brain injury cemented\nthe view that adult brains did not add new cells. If they did,\npeople thought, recovery would be more common.\n\n   The first crack in this belief occurred in 1965, when scientists\nreported that new nerve cells were generated in a region of the\nadult rat brain called the hippocampus. This is where memories for\nplaces and things are first formed. A year later, they discovered\nthat new cells were migrating to the olfactory bulb, where smells\nare decoded.\n\n   These researchers identified a zone within two hollow cavities\nof the rat brain, called ventricles, where new cells are born and\nthen migrate to the brain's interior. The zone contains so-called\nstem cells that give rise to many other cell types, including\nneurons and glial cells that nourish neurons.\n\n   The new cells seen in the rat brains appear at a higher rate\nafter challenges like intense training, injury or an infection,\nRaastad said. Within a few years, researchers found the cells in\nadult mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys. In the mid-1980s,\nother researchers found irrefutable evidence that new cells were\nborn in the brains of adult canaries learning new songs and\nchickadees that were remembering where they had stashed their\nwinter seeds. But researchers still did not believe that new cells\nwere created in human brains, Raastad said.\n\n   In 1997, Dr. Elizabeth Gould, an assistant professor of\nneuroscience at Princeton and colleagues showed that neurogenesis,\nor the birth of new cells, occurred in the hippocampuses of tree\nshrews and marmoset monkeys.
