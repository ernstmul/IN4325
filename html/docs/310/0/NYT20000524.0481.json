He ran an awesome race.''\n\n   Desormeaux was at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie yesterday for\nthe announcement of the 12 riders who will compete in the All-Star\nJockey Championship on June 23. He was low on excuses, but high on\nother things despite difficulty in his personal life.\n\n   Shortly before Desormeaux won the Kentucky Derby on Fusaichi\nPegasus, doctors had confirmed to him and his wife Sonia that their\n15-month-old son, Jacob, was deaf. As much as he's being asked\nabout Fusaichi Pegasus and the next race in the Belmont Stakes,\nDesormeaux is being asked how things are for his son.\n\n   ``We're still being schooled on what his hearing defects are,''\nDesormeaux said. ``The `why' and how to fix it are what we're\ntrying to learn.''\n\n   Desormeaux, 30, will be joined by Robby Albarado, Jorge Chavez,\nPat Day, Craig Perret, Laffit Pincay Jr., Edgar Prado, Jose Santos,\nShane Sellers, Mike Smith and Alex Solis in the All-Star Jockey\nChampionship. The only name that's yet to be added is the leading\nrider at Lone Star through June 4, and that's currently Donnie\nMeche by nine victories over Glenn Murphy.\n\n   In the meantime, Desormeaux said he and his family _ he and\nSonia also have a 7-year-old son, Joshua _ refuse to pout or make\nexcuses over their circumstances. Desormeaux himself lost the\nhearing in his left ear after complications from skull injuries in\na spill during the races in 1992 at Hollywood Park.\n\n   His family is trying to make things better with Jacob by\nlearning sign language, though they haven't given up hope that\nJacob will someday be able to hear.\n\n   ``Call me selfish,'' Desormeaux said, ``but I hope one day that\nJacob will hear his mother coming home through the door one day and\nhe can run up to her and say `Mommy, I love you.' There's nothing\nmore I'd like to give my wife _ and Jacob _ than that.''\n\n   In the meantime, the family is learning sign language. It's\ncreating togetherness.\n\n   ``We have to do this together as a family,'' Desormeaux said.\n``We've become so much closer.\n\n   ``Jacob is getting pretty good at it. He knows how to ask for\nfood when he's hungry. And Josh loves to learn how to say things\n\\Rin sign language\\S like `cat.' Josh is eager to learn.''\n\n   His family watches the bonding and thinks it's great to see, but\nsad at the same time. Desormeaux's older brother, Keith, is a\ntrainer based at Lone Star. He said he's extremely close to his\nbrother, only three years separating them in age, and sees how his\nbrother is growing.\n\n   ``You hate to think that for all of us to get stronger, it's\nbecause of what this boy is going through,'' Keith Desormeaux said.\n``But that'll be the bright side of this. It'll bring this family\ncloser together.\n\n   ``There's still a lot of kid in Kent. But there's no doubt that\nthis will play a big part in his maturation. These are the sorts of\nthings that make us who we are.''\n\n   Kent Desormeaux has been tried by tough times professionally. In\n1998, he took criticism for possibly moving too early on Real Quiet\nin the Belmont Stakes. Real Quiet would have won the Triple Crown\nby winning the Belmont, but he blew a four-length lead in the\nstretch and lost.\n\n   After the race, Desormeaux was jeered by a handful of vocal\nfans. It couldn't have been a scene that Desormeaux would want his\nkids to see, but Desormeaux wouldn't mind if Jacob could hear it.\n\n   Desormeaux said his son has deadened nerve endings in the ears.\nDoctors are fitting him with a special hearing aid. If that doesn't\nwork, doctors will implant a device onto the cochlea inside the ear\nthat will transmit radio waves into the brain.\n\n   ``It's profound,'' Desormeaux said.\n\n   More profound than Fusaichi Pegasus' rematch with Red Bullet in\nthe Belmont. nn\n","Headline":"\nJOCKEY'S LOSS IN PREAKNESS CAN'T COMPARE WITH SON'S HEARING DEFECT\n","Text":["\n   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Other than his belief that Fusaichi\nPegasus couldn't handle the wet track in the Preakness Stakes,\njockey Kent Desormeaux won't hem and haw about why his colt lost.\nThat he and Fusaichi Pegasus had a wider trip around the track than\nRed Bullet doesn't account for much in Desormeaux's book.\n","\n   ``That would be a pathetic excuse,'' Desormeaux said. ``Red\nBullet was one horse inside of me.\n","\n   ``That horse was fresh.
