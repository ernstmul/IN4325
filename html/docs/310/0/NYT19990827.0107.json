She declined to\nanswer questions about the matter.\n\n   Kelley's research and the controversy surrounding it echoes the\nexperience of John Mack, a renowned Harvard psychiatrist who wrote\nthe 1994 bestseller ``Abductions: Human Encounters with Aliens.''\nBy lending credence to the stories of those who claimed they were\nabducted and molested by space aliens, the book led to an\nunprecedented inquiry by the Harvard Medical School. A school\ncommittee eventually chastised him for engaging in unorthodox\nresearch and ``affirming the delusions'' of his patients.\n\n   But unlike Kelley, Mack has an international reputation. He\nearns hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants and won a Pulitzer\nPrize for his biography of Lawrence of Arabia. And while Harvard\nchallenged Mack's conclusions, the investigation at SUNY-Albany is\nfocused on methods.\n\n   Last week, University spokeswoman Mary Fiess released this\nstatement on the matter: ``The university imposed the suspension\nbecause of serious concerns that the experiment did not meet the\nstandards governing such projects on campus. While we're working to\ngather all the facts in this case, we cannot comment further.''\n\n   A memo sent to all psychology professors and graduate students\nlast week instructed them to refer calls ``looking for information\non any psychological research conducted in our department'' to the\nuniversity's public relations office.\n\n   According to three sources _ two faculty members and a graduate\nstudent _ the school's Institutional Review Board, which monitors\nhuman research, closed the project when a student complained late\nlast spring. The student, the sources said, was not allowed to\nleave a lecture that was part of Kelley's experiment. Refusal to\nallow a subject to leave an experiment violates National Science\nFoundation guidelines.\n\n   Despite the inquiry, Kelley, a fully tenured professor who\nearned $67,000 last year, is slated to teach two graduate courses\nin the fall.\n\n   The department became aware of Kelley's theories in the spring\nof 1998, when a note on her office door announced a lecture called\n``The Psychology of Invading the Self.'' The note described implant\nresearch funded by the National Security Agency and the Defense\nDepartment with an annual budget of $2 billion. The ``uninformed,\nunconsenting subjects'' of these devices were typically ``federal\nprisoners and political dissidents,'' the note said.\n\n   At the same time, Kelley won approval from the review board to\nconduct research on ``advances in technology that affect\ninterpersonal communication.''\n\n   In a 16-page outline to the board, Kelley said she wanted to\nlook at the uses of technology for ``monitoring and control.'' She\nproposed presenting a lecture to research subjects and then having\nthem respond to 60 questions about how the case study affected\ntheir views.\n\n   The interest in technology marked an extreme departure for\nKelley, a professor at SUNY-Albany since 1979. Kelley, who earned\nher doctorate from Purdue University, was a professor at Marquette\nUniversity and the University of Wisconsin before joining the\npsychology faculty at SUNY-Albany. Her previous research dealt with\nissues like health, date rape and risk-taking.

Companies declined to market the product for fear of\nbad transmissions causing deafness, he said.\n\n   George believed the point of the research was to look at how\npeople would perceive those with the implants, and whether there\nmight be a social stigma attached.\n\n   ``Kathryn has never been one to go traditional,'' George said.\n``But some of us wondered why we were looking at the social stigma\nof something that hadn't been developed yet.
