(lb) \n By RONALD SMOTHERS   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   There are 25 immigrants in the United States who are facing\ndeportation or exclusion from the country largely on evidence that\nthey are not permitted to see and that comes from people who are\nnot identified.\n\n   The federal government has defended the use of secret evidence\nin these cases, which usually involve allegations of association\nwith terrorists, but not actual charges of terrorism. Government\nofficials argue that the only way to persuade people to give\ninformation about terrorist activities is to offer the protection\nof complete anonymity.\n\n   Cases that involve allegations derived from secret evidence are\njust a tiny percentage of the more than 100,000 immigrant-status\ncases that the Immigration and Naturalization Service deals with\nevery year, said agency officials.\n\n   But all of those being held in these cases are of Arab descent\nor are Muslims. To Hala Maksoud, president of the Arab-American\nAnti-Discrimination Committee, this has the smell of ``human and\ncivil rights somehow being suspended when it comes to Muslims.''\n\n   Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, said that he could not comment on specific\ncases or give the names of all 25 men involved in secret-evidence\ncases.\n\n   But Bergeron defended the use of secret evidence and cited the\napproval of the practice under certain conditions by federal courts\nover four decades.\n\n   ``What essentially these courts have said is that the obligation\nof the U.S. government to protect its citizens from threats at\ntimes justifies a modification in the due process that will\nnormally be granted in judicial proceedings,'' Bergeron said.\n\n   A senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of\nanonymity said that it was not unusual for intelligence-gathering\nagencies to provide information in immigration cases. He also\ndefended keeping secret the details of information provided, to\nprotect the informers and ``costly technical systems that took\nyears to develop,'' like satellite surveillance systems.\n\n   ``These systems could be compromised by a disclosure that could\nindicate the method of operation,'' said the official.\n\n   The use of secret evidence is not new. The procedures have been\nin place and validated by courts since the early 1950s, when\ncommunism loomed as the perceived national-security threat.\n\n   Today, when the fear is that Middle East terrorism will spill\nover into the United States, the number of cases based on secret\nevidence has increased, said immigration officials. There have been\n50 cases since 1992, according to a February letter from Lori\nScialabba, the acting INS counsel at the time.\n\n   One of those cases played out in Newark, N.J., last week, when a\nman who has been held in jail since March had his day in court. He\nsays he believes that the only person accusing him of anything is\nhis former wife. But the names of his accusers are a secret.\n\n   To the accused immigrants, many of whom have been held in\ndetention for up to two years awaiting the outcome of deportation\nproceedings, and to their lawyers, this secret evidence _ a vague\nsummary of the secret data that never directly accuse the\nimmigrants of wrongdoing _ invites surreal literary comparisons.\n\n   ``It's Kafkaesque,'' said James Woolsey, the former director of\nthe CIA and a lawyer who is part of a team representing six exiled\nIraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein. The six were among a group of\n6,000 exiles brought to the United States in 1996 after their\nCIA-supported efforts to undermine Saddam failed. They have been\ndetained for a year on the basis of secret evidence.\n\n   For a time immigration officials would not let even Woolsey, who\ncontinues to have the highest of security clearances, view the\nsecret data. INS officials later said this was a mistake and they\ndeclassified nearly three-quarters of the material and provided\nunclassified summaries of the rest.\n\n   ``It was stunning,'' said Woolsey in a telephone interview.\nAlthough he did not provide copies of the files, he said that much\nof the so-called secret data turned out to be vague suspicions,\nsome the result of lies prompted by jealousies among the exiles and\nsome mistakes in translation during FBI interviews of the exiles.\n\n   ``This is something that would have been entirely appropriate in\nIraq,'' Woolsey said. ``But it is an outrage for the United\nStates.''\n\n   Noel Saleh, a Detroit immigration lawyer, said that his\nexperience was more reminiscent of Alice ``going through the\nlooking glass.'' His client, Imad Hamad _ a 35-year-old social\nworker from Detroit who has lived in the United States since 1980\nand is married to a citizen _ had to battle repeated efforts by\nimmigration officials to keep him from getting permanent residency.\n\n   Starting with immigration court hearings in 1989, the INS began\nbrandishing FBI reports and photographs of Hamad participating in\ndemonstrations and fund-raising events for local Arab-American\ngroups and suggesting that he was a member of the Popular Front for\nthe Liberation of Palestine.\n\n   But none of the proceedings, which continued off and on through\n1993, resulted in a final deportation order.\n\n   Then earlier this year INS officials said that they had secret\nevidence. At first they withheld it from from Hamad and his lawyer\nbut showed it to the immigration court judge. The judge dismissed\nit, saying that Hamad, a homeowner and father of three who was\nmarried to a naturalized U.S. citizen was not a security risk. He\ngranted him permanent resident status.\n\n   The INS is appealing this ruling, but in June it declassified\nmuch of the secret evidence that it sought to use to bar Hamad.\n\n   ``The things they said were secret evidence turned out to be the\nsame declassified stuff we saw from the FBI back in the 1989\nhearing,'' said Saleh. ``What was declassified should never have\nbeen classified in the first place.''\n\n   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said that the\ncourt cases allowing the use of secret evidence have considered\ngrants of political asylum and other efforts for noncitizens as\n``discretionary benefits and extraordinary acts of sovereign\ngenerosity.''\n\n   They are not rights, he said, and because they are\ndiscretionary, national security or other considerations can be\nbrought to bear. The result is that in certain immigration\nproceedings, noncitizens are not guaranteed the due process that\nthey would have in criminal cases.\n\n   Although the courts have upheld the use of secret evidence in\nimmigration cases, the Justice Department, which oversees the INS\nand the Executive Office of Immigration Review _ whose 200 judges\nhear most immigration cases _ has recently acknowledged that some\nchanges may be in order.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   In meetings in June with a group complaining about the use of\nsecret evidence, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said that his\noffice would start reviewing all material used as secret evidence\nin immigration cases. He also said the Justice Department would\nre-evaluate the classified nature of some of the allegations in the\npending 25 cases and make it a practice to provide lawyers and\ntheir clients with declassified summaries of the classified data.\n\n   In addition, two U.S. senators are voicing concern because all\nof the current cases using secret evidence are against people of\nArab descent or Muslims.\n\n   In a letter last week to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS\nCommissioner Doris Meissner, the two senators _ Spencer Abraham of\nMichigan, the Republican chairman of the subcommittee on\nimmigration, and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the ranking\nDemocrat on the subcommittee _ said they had ``grave concerns''\nabout the fairness and due-process issues raised by the use of\nsecret evidence.\n\n   ``Some also believe that the recent actions create the\nappearance that the INS may be using secret evidence only in cases\nagainst Arab immigrants,'' the letter said. ``This is especially\ndisturbing since many of these cases appear to be based not on any\nactions of the immigrants, but rather on their purported\nassociations.''\n\n   The Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings next month\non the INS and its detention practices.\n\n   Louis Bograd, head of the prison project of the American Civil\nLiberties Union and a member of the coalition, said that the\nanti-terrorism act authorized the establishment of a new judicial\narm called ``alien terrorist removal courts,'' which would be\nempowered to use secret evidence to deport suspected terrorists.\n\n   But those courts, which have yet to be established, would allow\nlawyers with security clearances to view the secret evidence and\npermit judges to order fuller declassified summaries that could be\nseen by the immigrant.\n\n   ``We don't think these protections are adequate, but they are\ncertainly better than what INS is now providing when it comes to\nsecret evidence,'' said Bograd, who represents Nasser Ahmed, a New\nYork man who has been held in prison for 27 months largely because\nof secret evidence. ``If the government can use secret evidence\nagainst resident aliens, then there is no real constitutional\nimpediment to using it against citizens.''\n\n   Woolsey disagreed somewhat, saying that there were situations in\nwhich secret evidence could be used, but only with ``strict\nsafeguards.''\n\n   ``I am not opposed to it completely as long as there are\nprocedures to share the information with counsel who have security\nclearances,'' he said.\n\n   This might help find problem cases, such as those of people with\nulterior motives making charges under the cover of secrecy.\n\n   Hany Kiareldeen is a 30-year-old manager of a Passaic, N.J.,\nelectronics store who has been in the United States since 1990, and\nhas spent five months in jail. A declassified summary of the\nallegations against him that was given to his lawyer in April said\nthat unnamed informants accused him of making ``a credible threat''\non Reno's life in conversations and of meeting with Nidal Ayyad,\none of the convicted World Trade Center bombers, a week before the\nexplosion at the building in 1993.\n\n   Edward Shulman, the lawyer who is fighting INS efforts to deport\nKiareldeen to his native Gaza, said that he and his client, who\ndenies making any threats or even knowing Ayyad, suspect that the\nsecret evidence came from his former wife, who, the lawyer said,\nhad a history of vindictiveness even before the couple's bitter\ndivorce a year ago.\n\n   During a deportation hearing this week in Immigration Court in\nNewark, INS lawyers expressed concern that opening the hearing to\nthe public and allowing Shulman to ask certain questions of some\nwitnesses could reveal the identity of and jeopardize the safety of\na secret informer who they said had received death threats.\n\n   Kiareldeen's former wife, Amal Mohamed, was called to the stand\nto testify. She balked at answering questions about contacts she\nhad had with the FBI in the case, saying that it was her life that\nhad been threatened by some unknown forces. The case was adjourned\nuntil Sept. 18 and Kiareldeen was returned to a prison cell while\nhis lawyers sought an order from a federal judge to compel Ms.\nMohamed to testify.\n\n   ``It's like we don't know who we are fighting,'' said Ms.\nMaksoud, referring to Kiareldeen's and others' cases. ``It's\nmind-boggling.''\n","Headline":"\nSECRET EVIDENCE MAY BE THREAT TO SOME IMMIGRANTS \n","Text":["\n   There are 25 immigrants in the United States who are facing\ndeportation or exclusion from the country largely on evidence that\nthey are not permitted to see and that comes from people who are\nnot identified.\n","\n   The federal government has defended the use of secret evidence\nin these cases, which usually involve allegations of association\nwith terrorists, but not actual charges of terrorism.
