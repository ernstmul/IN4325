Times News Service    \n\n   Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates Again\n\n   The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates by a quarter\nof a percentage point, taking the unusual step of moving on his own\nauthority in between the central bank's regularly scheduled\npolicy-setting meetings.\n\n   The move lifted the markets, which had grown increasingly\nrattled by the spread of the financial crisis that began last year\nin Asia. But it also suggested that the Fed is concerned that the\nnation's long economic expansion could be endangered by the growing\nreluctance of lenders and investors to provide businesses with\nmoney.\n\n   _ By RICHARD W. STEVENSON\n\n   Charges in Olympic Bombing\n\n   Two years after a pipe bomb exploded at Centennial Olympic Park\nin Atlanta, federal authorities charged Eric Robert Rudolph with\nthe attack, which killed one woman and injured hundreds. Rudolph,\nalready wanted for his role in a fatal January bombing at an\nabortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., was also accused of two other\nAtlanta bombings in 1996.\n\n   Rudolph has been the subject of a massive manhunt in the dense\nwoods of western North Carolina, where he has so far eluded\ncapture.\n\n   _ By DAVID JOHNSTON\n\n   Uniting Faith and Reason\n\n   In an encyclical marking his 20th anniversary as pope, John Paul\nII made a spirited defense of clear, rational thought, criticizing\nthose who take shortcuts to life's answers or who rely too much on\nblind faith. Never ``abandon the passion for ultimate truth,'' he\nurged. Philosophers, ``be they Christian or not,'' should ``trust\nin the power of human reason.''\n\n   He was unambiguous, though, about where that reason should\nultimately lead: to ``the truth of Christ, the one definitive\nanswer to humanity's problems.'' And he did not address one of\nhumanity's most divisive issues: abortion.\n\n   _ By HUBERT B. HERRING\n\n   FBI Opens DNA Data Base\n\n   The FBI opened a national computer data base that holds\nidentifying information from the DNA of convicted felons. The new\nsystem, which consists of smaller state-run data bases that are\nlinked by common test procedures and software, will enable DNA from\na crime scene to be compared with DNA from convicted felons in all\n50 states.\n\n   Crime experts hope the data base will lead to the earlier\napprehension of repeat offenders, including many rapists.\n\n   _ By NICHOLAS WADE\n\n   American Spy Arrested\n\n   A 46-year-old retired enlisted man who had worked in both Army\nintelligence and at the super-secret National Security Agency was\narrested by the FBI on charges that he spied for Moscow during the\nlast days of the Soviet Union.\n\n   David Sheldon Boone was arrested after he was lured back to the\nUnited States from his home in Germany by agents posing as Russian\nspies who wanted him to resume his espionage career.\n\n   _ By JAMES RISEN\n\n   Prenatal AIDS Tests Sought\n\n   Testing for the AIDS virus should be a routine part of every\npregnant woman's prenatal care, a panel of experts from the\nInstitute of Medicine recommended. Checking for HIV infection need\nnot be accompanied by extensive AIDS counseling, as now recommended\nby federal officials, which some doctors find so burdensome that\nthey forgo offering tests. Treating infected women with anti-HIV\ndrugs cuts the risk of transmission to newborns by two-thirds.\n\n   _ By WARREN E. LEARY\n\n   Plan to Save the Everglades\n\n   The Army Corps of Engineers unveiled a vast plan to fix the\nnatural plumbing of southern Florida, restoring a more natural flow\nof fresh water through the imperiled Everglades.\n\n   The program would cost $8 billion and take 20 years. But many\nquestions remain. Will Congress and Florida's legislature agree to\nspend the money? And will the plans to store billions of gallons of\nwater in huge reservoirs and underground aquifers work?\n\n   _ By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.\n\n   NBA Cancels Games\n\n   The first two weeks of the National Basketball Association\nseason were canceled as labor talks slowed to a crawl. The players'\nunion and the league lobbed verbal grenades at each other in the\ndispute, which involves the distribution of about $2 billion in\nleague income.\n\n   Some hope remains in the form of new proposals and a key\narbitration decision due Monday but league officials are weighing\nthe possibility of canceling more games in another week.\n\n   _ By MIKE WISE\n\n   U.N. Gangs Up on Embargo\n\n   A year ago, in a United Nations General Assembly vote, 143\nnations favored an end to the American embargo on Cuba. Only the\nUnited States, Israel and Uzbekistan said nay. This year,\nUzbekistan defected _ and some abstaining nations came around _ in\na record 157-to-2 vote.\n\n   Washington's official line, as global support nears the\nvanishing point, is that ``sanctions are an important foreign\npolicy tool,'' but one foreign-policy expert is convinced that a\n``sanction-happy'' Congress has clung to the embargo ``for domestic\nreasons.''\n\n   _ By HUBERT B.

BROWNE\n\n   New Insulation for Airlines\n\n   First it was airliner seats, then carpeting and other cabin\ncomponents. Now the Federal Aviation Administration says it's\nairplane insulation that burns too easily and should be changed.\nThe agency said it would devise a new flammability test within six\nmonths and then require new and old planes to meet it, although it\nasked airlines to start work immediately.

WALD\n\n   Big Layoffs at Merrill Lynch\n\n   Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's largest brokerage firm, sent a\nshudder through Wall Street _ and New York City _ when it said it\nwould get rid of 3,400 jobs, or a little more than 5 percent of its\nwork force.\n\n   Reacting to the recent turmoil in financial markets, the firm\nsaid it was preparing for tougher times ahead. Merrill Lynch said\nthe job cuts would save $500 million a year. Other big brokerage\nfirms and banks are likely to follow suit.\n\n   _ By PETER TRUELL\n\n   nn\n\n   The Spoils of the Budget War\n\n   Schoolteachers, immigrants and the Pentagon emerged as big\nwinners after Congress and President Clinton reached agreement on\nthe $1.7 trillion federal budget. Weighty issues aside, some\nlawmakers were quietly enjoying their success in slipping into the\nhuge spending bill several favors to constituents.\n\n   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had the duck-hunting season in\nMississippi and five other Southern states extended by 11 days,\nover the objections of hunters up north. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif.,\ngot $5 million for a study of how best to clean up the polluted\nSalton Sea in Southern California.\n\n   Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., had $100 million inserted to build a\n52-mile interstate highway in southern Arkansas. California\nlawmakers prevailed upon negotiators to include $8 million for a\nnew forest-management program in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n   Not everyone came away happy. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J,\nfailed to prolong a big drug maker's monopoly on the popular\nallergy pill Claritin.\n\n   And Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., wanted to cut the cost of imported\nItalian wool to garment makers by $10 million to help offset a\ntariff that Canadian rivals do not have to pay. But all Walsh could\nwangle was a promise that the Labor Department will study the\nissue.\n\n   _ By ERIC SCHMITT\n\n   The Unbearable Badness of Being\n\n   Sometimes, bad is good.\n\n   Consider the Museum of Bad Art, which is housed in a dank,\nconcrete basement next to the men's room of the community theater\nin the Boston suburb of Dedham.\n\n   A stroll through the museum's permanent collection tends to\nbring expressions of dismay from many visitors, as they pass works\nlike ``Lucy in the Field With Flowers,'' a portrait of a rather\nnasty-looking old woman set against a hideous yellow sky, or\n``Sunday on the Pot With George,'' a pointillist vision of a heavy\nman seated on a toilet.\n\n   The ineffable badness of some of the works, in fact, makes them\nall but indescribable.\n\n   But the museum's founders say the point of all this badness is\nthat it's all right, and often even quite interesting, to fail;\nthat people who only sing in the shower, or paint on Sundays, are\nalso worth celebrating, simply for their love of making art.\n\n   And for a place that celebrates failure, the five-year-old\nmuseum is enjoying marked success. It has put out a book and a\nCD-ROM, and its Web site, www.glyphs.com/moba, is well visited.\n\n   Its artists are happy too, the founders say, and the submissions\ncontinue to roll in because of the following win-win logic: if an\nartist's work is accepted, he can say he has work hung in a museum;\nand if it is rejected, he can boast that the world's top authority\non bad art has officially declared him ``not bad.''\n\n   _ By CAREY GOLDBERG\n","Headline":"\nTHE WEEK IN REVIEW \n","Text":["\n   Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates Again\n","\n   The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates by a quarter\nof a percentage point, taking the unusual step of moving on his own\nauthority in between the central bank's regularly scheduled\npolicy-setting meetings.\n","\n   The move lifted the markets, which had grown increasingly\nrattled by the spread of the financial crisis that began last year\nin Asia.
