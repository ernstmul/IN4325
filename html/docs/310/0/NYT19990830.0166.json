They are a menace.\n\n   Sure, I know that cell phones are great timesavers. They allow\npeople to keep in touch on the road. In case of an emergency, they\ncan be lifesavers. I'm glad that my spouse carries a cell phone for\nthat reason. At times, I've even been guilty of calling her in her\ncar, although I do try to keep the conversation as brief as\npossible.\n\n   But they are dangerous. Here's news to all you people using your\ncell phones in your car. You're snockered. You are driving just\nabout as well as someone who has quaffed the legal limit of\nalcohol.\n\n   That's the conclusion of a Toronto study published in the\nprestigious New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n     \nMORE ACCIDENT-PRONE WITH PHONES?   \n  \n\n   The study looked at people who had car accidents and also had\ncar phones. Then it looked at billing records of those car phones\nto see if the persons were talking on the phone at the time of the\ncollision.\n\n   The study had several holes. The authors noted that people who\nwere talking a lot on car phones might also have been under\nemotional stress at the time. So that stress, rather than car phone\nuse, might have contributed to the accident. However, it also noted\nthat they had to receive permission from people in the accident to\nexamine their car phone records. Those worried about legal\nliability might have refused access. So, the relationship between\ncar phone use and accidents might be higher than the study found.\nThe study also excluded drivers injured in the accident.\n\n   There also are plenty of other distractions drivers suffer.\nThose can include everything from the children screaming in the\nback seat to someone riding with you who insists on holding a\nconversation at the worst possible time.\n\n   Distraction is, after all, distraction.\n\n   Still, the study concluded that those talking on car phones are\nfour times more likely to have an accident than those not using\nthem. That's the same rate of people who are driving while mildly\nintoxicated, but beyond the legal limit.\n\n   So, what about different styles of car phones? Is it safer to\nhave a hands-free model, rather than holding up the phone with your\nhand or raising a shoulder and tilting your head to the side to\nhold the phone against your ear?\n\n   Hands-free, says the conventional wisdom, is safer. The Toronto\nstudy found no difference in the accident rate.
