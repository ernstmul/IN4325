But the converse is, if it's in the brain stem, which\ncontrols breathing and life-sustaining functions, then curative\ntreatment may be much less likely.''\n\n   But there are many types of brain cancer, and the outlook for\npatients varies widely depending on the type as well as the\nlocation of the tumor. Gansler said the most common type of primary\nbrain cancer in adults is a glioma.\n\n   Those tumors form not in the nerve cells of the brain, but in\nglial cells, which comprise several different types of cells that\ncarry out a variety of functions. Some help to support and nourish\nnerve cells, some make the fatty material that insulates nerve\ncells, others line cavities in the brain that contain cerebrospinal\nfluid.\n\n   Gliomas vary in both the type of cell they affect and their\naggressiveness. In some cases, the average survival is six to eight\nyears, but in others it may be only 12 to 18 months.\n\n   ``In cases where the outlook is not very good, people might want\nto explore clinical trials that offer new treatments that may be\nmore effective,'' Gansler said, noting that the National Cancer\nInstitute Web site (the address is www.nci.nih.gov) lists 106\nstudies now in progress, testing experimental treatments for brain\ncancer in adults.\n\n   The treatments include radiation, chemotherapy, biological\ntherapies that alter the immune system and gene therapy designed to\nmake tumor cells more vulnerable to certain cancer-killing drugs.\n\n   Tuesday, a spokesman for the archdiocese said that O'Connor, who\nwas released from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on\nSaturday, was recuperating at home and still planning to say Mass\nthis Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\n   ``He is at his residence, and working,'' said the spokesman,\nJoseph Zwilling. ``He has been working all the way through, even\nwhile in the hospital.
