State Rep. Catherine Barrett (D-Cincinnati) said she will\nask the House Transportation and Public Safety Committee for\nanother hearing on her bill, which was introduced this year and\nfailed to move through the Ohio General Assembly.\n\n   Judging by how other states have handled similar legislation,\nBarrett may not have much better luck this time around.\n\n   Recent efforts to place legal restrictions on auto cell phone\nuse have been shot down in 22 states, according to the National\nConference of State Legislatures. As is the case with Barrett's\nbill, legislation in those 22 states ``died in committee'',\naccording to an NCSL survey. In Maryland lawmakers tried to bar the\nuse of cell phones in moving vehicles. In Texas, legislators tried\nto create a criminal charge of ``using a telephone while operating\na motor vehicle.'' And in Virginia lawmakers wanted to ban cell\nphone use among schoolbus drivers on the road. All failed.\n\n   Most Ohio lawmakers seem in no hurry to ban cell phone use in\ncars.\n\n   ``I don't think anyone wants to ignore the concern for the\nissue, but there hasn't been a lot of support for the bill at this\ntime,'' said state Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg.\n\n   The U.S. is expected to have more than 80 million cell phone\nusers in 2000. The concern that auto cell phone use was endangering\npeople on the road intensified this year following several federal\nstudies.
