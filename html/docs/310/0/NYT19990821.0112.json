Times News Service    \n\n   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in\n1976, 566 people have been executed. In that same period, 82\nconvicts awaiting execution have been exonerated _ a ratio of one\nfreed for every seven put to death.\n\n   About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far this\nyear.\n\n   In many cases convictions were overturned when newly available\ntestimony or physical evidence, including DNA testing, cast doubt\non the guilt of the inmates.\n\n   Capital punishment is on the books in 38 states, but 36 of them\nimpose a deadline on evidence presented after conviction.\nVirginia's statute of limitations is only 21 days. In 1994 DNA\ntesting arrived too late to free Earl Washington Jr., whose\nsentence was subsequently commuted to life in prison. David\nBotkins, the spokesman for Virginia's attorney general, Mark\nEarley, says, ``The inmates who have been granted clemency and had\ntheir death sentences commuted show the system works.''\n\n   In Illinois, one of the two states without a statute of\nlimitations (the other is New York), one inmate has been exonerated\nfor every inmate executed over the last 12 years. Earlier this\nmonth Illinois passed the Capital Crimes Litigation Act, which\nincreases state funding for defense lawyers, prosecutors and\ncourt-appointed counsel.\n\n   In general, executions have been delayed by appeals. About 11\nyears elapse between conviction and execution, according to the\nJustice Department. Last week a conference organized by the 11th\nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals met outside Atlanta to discuss how to\nexpedite capital punishment.\n\n   The wrong people have landed on death row for a number of\nreasons. Some lawyers are ineffective, or outright incompetent.\nOthers meet with their clients only hours before going to court.\nProsecutorial missteps, from jury selection to misconduct, have\nalso been factors. Judges, too, make mistakes, incorrectly ruling\non cases or improperly defining guilt or innocence. When judicial\nerrors occur, an inmate can be granted a new trial.\n\n   Many death row cases attract the attention of lawyers who\nvolunteer their time to dig up evidence and witnesses. Barry\nScheck, a lawyer who is a DNA expert, helped found the Innocence\nProject at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York\nCity, which has so far helped free several inmates. Students guided\nby David Protess, a journalism professor at Northwestern\nUniversity, have also uncovered evidence leading to the exoneration\nof death row inmates in Illinois.\n\n   Since capital punishment was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt in 1976, 566 convicts have been executed. Eighty-two awaiting\nexecution have been exonerated, about half of them during this\ndecade. What follows are capsule accounts of death row's living\nalumni of the 1990s.\n\n   ERRORS IN COURT\n\n   James Albert Robison\n\n   Convicted: 1977\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: The contract murder of Don Bolles, a newspaper reporter\nwho covered organized crime in Arizona. Prosecutors charged that\nRobison and another man, John Harvey Adamson, were hired by Max\nDunlap, a land developer, who was also convicted. Adamson was given\na 20-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Robison. But\nthe state overturned the conviction in 1980 after finding that\ndefense lawyers had been improperly denied the right to\ncross-examine Adamson. Robison was re-indicted for the Bolles\nmurder. In the 1993 trial, he was acquitted of murdering Bolles,\nbut later convicted of conspiring to kill Adamson. He is now in the\nwitness protection program in Arizona.\n\n   Patrick Croy\n\n   Convicted: 1979\n\n   Released: 1990\n\n   Crime: The shooting death of a policeman in California. The\nstate Supreme Court overturned the conviction because of improper\njury instructions made by the judge in his case. Croy was retried\nand acquitted after arguing self-defense.\n\n   Troy Lee Jones\n\n   Convicted: 1982\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: The murder of Carolyn Grayson in California in 1981. At\nhis original trial, Jones' defense lawyer failed to speak with\npossible witnesses, obtain a police report or conduct a pretrial\ninvestigation. The state Supreme Court said the Jones case merited\na new trial, and the prosecution dropped all charges.\n\n   Roberto Miranda\n\n   Convicted: 1982\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: The stabbing death of Manuel Rodriguez Torres in Nevada\nin 1981. Miranda, a Cuban, was offered a much milder sentence in\nexchange for a guilty plea, but refused it, insisting on his\ninnocence and claiming that a man he knew had framed him. At trial\nhe was represented by a lawyer with less than one year of\nexperience. Overturning the conviction, the judge wrote that the\nlack of pretrial preparation by trial counsel ... cannot be\njustified.\n\n   Charles Smith\n\n   Convicted: 1983\n\n   Released: 1991\n\n   Crime: Murdering a woman during a robbery in Indiana. A\ncompanion, who claimed to be the getaway driver, testified against\nSmith in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him. The\nstate Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing ineffective\ncounsel. Later evidence contradicted the companion's testimony.\n\n   Dale Johnston\n\n   Convicted: 1984\n\n   Released: 1990\n\n   Crime: Murdering his stepdaughter and her boyfriend in Ohio,\nallegedly to keep them from blackmailing him with accusations of\nincest. The court of appeals later ruled that statements by\nJohnston used in the first trial could not be introduced at a\nretrial because they were taken while he was under hypnosis.\n\n   nn\n\n   Federico Martinez Macias\n\n   Convicted: 1984\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: The murder of a man during a burglary in Texas in 1983.\nMacias' co-worker, who received immunity for testifying, said he\ndrove him to the crime scene the night of the murder; a prison\ninformant also said he heard Macias confess. In 1988, pro bono\nlawyers revealed evidence of inadequate trial counsel: Two alibi\nwitnesses had never been called to testify, an eyewitness had not\nbeen cross-examined and a 9-year-old girl's testimony proved to be\nfalse.\n\n   Benjamin Harris\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1997\n\n   Crime: The murder of Jimmy Lee Turner, an auto mechanic in\nWashington state. Harris' lawyer consulted with him less than two\nhours and interviewed only three of 32 potential witnesses. After\ntwo unsuccessful appeals, Harris' conviction was overturned in 1994\nbecause of inadequate counsel. The prosecution declined to retry\nHarris, instead saying that he was mentally ill and requesting that\nhe be committed to a state hospital. On the condition that he\npursue treatment, he was released.\n\n   Gregory Wilhoit\n\n   Convicted: 1987\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: Killing his estranged wife in her sleep in Oklahoma. An\nexpert testified that Wilhoit's teeth matched bite marks on the\nbody. The state appeals court later said that Wilhoit's counsel had\nfailed to challenge that testimony, and was ``suffering from\nalcohol dependence and abuse and brain damage during his\nrepresentation of appellant.'' At trial in 1993, after 11 experts\ntestified that the bite marks did not match, Wilhoit was acquitted.\n\n   Carl Lawson\n\n   Convicted: 1990\n\n   Released: 1996\n\n   Crime: Killing 8-year-old Terrence Jones during a family dispute\nin Illinois. Although Lawson was found guilty, the defense lawyer\nassigned to him was later found to have been an assistant\nprosecutor at the time of his arrest. Another trial resulted in a\nhung jury; finally, Lawson was acquitted in 1996 and set free.\n\n   Clarence Dexter\n\n   Convicted: 1991\n\n   Released: 1999\n\n   Crime: Murdering his wife in Missouri in 1991. Dexter's\nconviction was overturned in 1998 because his defense had failed to\ninvestigate any of the evidence, much of which pointed to a botched\nrobbery. Blood left at the scene did not match Dexter's.\n\n   Shareef Cousin\n\n   Convicted: 1996\n\n   Released: 1999\n\n   Crime: The murder of MuAlfred Michael Gerardi during an armed\nrobbery in Louisiana. Cousin, who was 16, said he was at a\nbasketball game, and his coach testified that he was at the game.\nBut his court-appointed lawyer advised him to plead guilty to four\nunrelated counts of armed robbery to gain the jury's sympathy.\nCousin was convicted of first-degree murder and the four robberies.\nThe state Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction because of\nimproper evidence, but he is still imprisoned for the other\nconvictions.\n\n   PROBLEMS WITH TESTIMONY\n\n   Clarence Brandley\n\n   Convicted: 1981\n\n   Released: 1990\n\n   Crime: The rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in a Texas high\nschool. Hair left at the crime scene implicated a white man, not\nBrandley, the only black custodian at the school. One of the two\nchief witnesses recanted his statements in a 1986 appeal hearing,\nsaying the prosecution and the police had pressured him into\nimplicating Brandley; the other witness confessed to the crime.\n\n   Ricardo Aldape Guerra\n\n   Convicted: 1982\n\n   Released: 1997\n\n   Crime: Killing a police officer in Houston. After the state\nappeals were exhausted, the case went to a U.S. district judge, who\ndecided that the police and prosecutors had railroaded Guerra, a\nMexican, onto death row.\n\n   Anthony Porter\n\n   Convicted: 1983\n\n   Released: 1999\n\n   Crime: A double murder in Chicago witnessed by several people.\nHis lawyer lost several appeals, but two days before his execution\ndate last fall, Porter was granted a stay because of his limited\nmental capacity. When a journalism professor at Northwestern\nUniversity, David Protess, assigned his students to investigate the\ncase, several witnesses recanted and another man confessed.\n\n   Muneer Deeb\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: Planning a 1982 triple murder in Texas carried out by\nthree gunmen, who were later convicted. Deeb's conviction was\nreversed in 1991 because testimony had been improperly admitted\nfrom an inmate who said he heard Deeb confess while awaiting trial.\n\n   Robert Charles Cruz\n\n   Convicted: 1981\n\n   Released: 1995\n\n   Crime: Ordering the contract killing of two people in Arizona.\nAlthough physical evidence was scant, Cruz was convicted mainly on\nthe testimony of a participant in the killings who was granted\nimmunity for his testimony. At the last trial, the jury foreman\nsaid, We all came to the conclusion that the state's main witness\nwas an unreliable witness, a proven liar.\n\n   Steven Smith\n\n   Convicted: 1985\n\n   Released: 1999\n\n   Crime: The murder of a jail warden, Virdeen Willis Jr., outside\na Chicago tavern. Smith, whose criminal record already included two\nconvictions for murder in 1964 and 1969, was convicted with the\ntestimony of one eyewitness, who was later found to be closely tied\nto another suspect in the case. The state Supreme Court vacated\nSmith's conviction and barred prosecutors from trying him again.\n\n   Walter McMillian\n\n   Convicted: 1988\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: Killing an 18-year-old woman, Ronda Morrison, during a\nrobbery in Alabama. He was arrested with another man, Ralph Myers,\nwho agreed to testify against him in exchange for leniency.\nMcMillian was placed in a death row cell before his trial even\nbegan. The judge overruled the jury's recommendation of life in\nprison and sentenced McMillian to die. An investigation by a lawyer\nrevealed suppression of exculpatory information and perjury by all\nof the prosecution's witnesses, who later recanted their testimony.\n\n   nn\n\n   Federico Martinez Macias\n\n   Convicted: 1984\n\n   Released: 1993\n\n   Crime: The murder of a man during a burglary in Texas in 1983.\nMacias' co-worker, who received immunity for testifying, said he\ndrove him to the crime scene the night of the murder; a prison\ninformant also said he heard Macias confess.
