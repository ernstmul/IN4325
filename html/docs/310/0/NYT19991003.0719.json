Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ After blessing the opening of a new cancer center,\nCardinal John O'Connor said Monday that he did not apply the word\n``cancer'' to himself.\n\n   Climbing into a car after the dedication ceremony for St.\nVincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center, the cardinal said the\nhospital where he was treated for a brain tumor, the Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had not described his condition as\ncancerous.\n\n   ``So I am not using the word `cancer,''' he said. ``They took\nout a brain tumor and now they are zapping me, but I am not using\nthat word.''\n\n   After entering the hospital on Aug. 23, the cardinal underwent\nsurgery to remove the small tumor on the surface of his brain, and\nhe was released on Sept. 5. He is now nearing the end of a\nfive-week course of radiation.\n\n   The archdiocese has released few details about his illness and\ntreatment, although the cardinal did say he went to Sloan-Kettering\nbecause he was feeling weak and persistently nauseated.\n\n   There are essentially three types of brain tumors: noncancerous,\nwhich is sometimes treated with radiation; malignant and\noriginating in the brain, and metastatic, which results from the\nspread of the cancer from another part of the body.\n\n   The archdiocese has not said which kind O'Connor had, and\nofficials would not elaborate further Monday about the cardinal's\ncondition.\n\n   During a quick tour of St. Vincent's new $33 million, 24-hour\noutpatient center, the cardinal sprinkled holy water around the\ncenter, taking particular note of the new linear accelerator, which\ndelivers radiation. ``This is where I lie every morning for 60\nseconds,'' he said, pointing to the table.\n\n   O'Connor noted that many people had asked why he had not sought\ntreatment at St. Vincent's, the city's premier Catholic hospital\nand center of a new consortium of eight hospitals.\n\n   ``When someone tells you you have a brain tumor, it pushes a lot\nof things out of your mind,'' he said, explaining that\nSloan-Kettering was closer to his residence at Madison Avenue and\n51st Street. Turning personal, the cardinal said: ``Having had a\ntumor treated, my perspective has been radically altered. As a\npriest, I have visited many hospitals. As a patient, I have a\ntotally new view, and I thank God for the view he has given me, the\nunconditional trust I have in Him. With a brain tumor, you have no\nidea of the outcome. Fortunately, the surgery was successful.''\n\n   The cardinal fell ill at a time when speculation about his\nfuture as he approaches his 80th birthday on Jan. 15 was mounting.\nCardinals are expected to submit their resignations to the pope\nwhen they reach 75, though, as in O'Connor's case, the pope is not\nobligated to accept them. He can remain in office, although at the\nage of 80, he will lose his vote in Vatican matters, including the\nelection of the next pope.\n\n   ``Now I have developed another apostolate at the advanced age of\n61,'' he said, jokingly subtracting 18 years from his age. ``At\ntimes when I go for treatment, I find great numbers of people\nsitting there, terribly worried and desperate. I stop and chat with\nthem, and they look at me as if I were one of them. When the holy\nfather decides that I've done enough damage here, that would be a\ngreat apostolate for me.''\n","Headline":"\nNEW YORK CARDINAL AVOIDS `CANCER' IN DESCRIBING HIS CONDITION \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ After blessing the opening of a new cancer center,\nCardinal John O'Connor said Monday that he did not apply the word\n``cancer'' to himself.\n","\n   Climbing into a car after the dedication ceremony for St.\nVincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center, the cardinal said the\nhospital where he was treated for a brain tumor, the Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had not described his condition as\ncancerous.\n","\n   ``So I am not using the word `cancer,''' he said. ``They took\nout a brain tumor and now they are zapping me, but I am not using\nthat word.''\n","\n   After entering the hospital on Aug. 23, the cardinal underwent\nsurgery to remove the small tumor on the surface of his brain, and\nhe was released on Sept. 5.
