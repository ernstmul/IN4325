Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Federal authorities have intensified their\ndeliberations about whether to prosecute a Los Alamos nuclear\nweapons scientist on charges of mishandling highly classified\natomic data, government officials said on Tuesday.\n\n   A decision on whether to charge the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, is\nexpected within days, the officials said, after a crucial meeting\nheld Saturday at the White House attended by the administration's\ntop security, law enforcement and energy officials.\n\n   The participants concluded after a lengthy intelligence review\nthat should Attorney General Janet Reno decide to prosecute, the\nsecrets that would likely be divulged at a criminal trial would not\nirreparably damage the country's national security.\n\n   Among those present in addition to Reno were Sandy Berger,\nPresident Clinton's national security adviser; Energy Secretary\nBill Richardson; FBI Director Louis Freeh; CIA Director George\nTenet, and John Kelly, the top federal prosecutor in Albuquerque,\nN.M., who has jurisdiction over the case.\n\n   Law enforcement officials and Kelly have recommended going ahead\nwith a case against Lee, said the officials, who asked not to be\nidentified. Richardson, who supports bringing a prosecution,\nindicated that he is prepared to exercise his statutory authority\nto declassify atomic secrets likely to be needed as evidence in the\ntrial, the officials said. But they added that it is Reno who must\ndecide whether to seek an indictment and she has not given\nprosecutors final approval.\n\n   Lee, his lawyers and his supporters have repeatedly said that he\nhas done nothing wrong and that no one has ever been criminally\ncharged for similar conduct, for example, transferring classified\ninformation into a nonclassified computer. Mark Holscher, Lee's\nattorney in Los Angeles, did not return telephone calls on Tuesday.\n\n   In the past, Holscher and Lee's other supporters have said that\nLee is a loyal American who has been unfairly singled out for\ninvestigation because of his Chinese ancestry. They say that Lee is\nbeing made a scapegoat by law enforcement and energy officials who\nhave been under fire by Republicans in Congress for security lapses\nat the country's weapons laboratories. In a television interview in\nAugust, Lee also said he was innocent.\n\n   The highly unusual White House meeting reflects the acute\npolitical sensitivities and high stakes involved in a case that has\nbecome a battleground between the administration and Republican\ncritics who have said that Chinese intelligence had used scientists\nto steal information from the weapons labs that was used to vastly\naccelerate the pace of Beijing's nuclear weapons program.\n\n   As expected, if he is charged, Lee will not be accused of\nespionage, the officials said, which would require prosecutors to\nshow that information was not only stolen but passed to a foreign\npower. Prosecutors are now weighing whether to charge Lee with a\nlesser crime of mishandling and failing to adequately safeguard\nclassified information.\n\n   The recent surge of activity in the case comes just before the\nexpiration of the term of a federal grand jury in Albuquerque that\nhas been hearing evidence in the case. The grand jurors were to be\ndismissed this month, but their terms have been extended until\nearly January.\n\n   Lee, who worked in the nuclear weapons design area of Los\nAlamos, was fired from his job in March for security violations. By\nthat time, he had been under investigation for nearly three years\nin connection with the government's inquiry into the apparent theft\nof U.S. nuclear secrets by China. U.S. investigators believe that\ndesign information related to the most advanced nuclear warhead in\nthe nation's arsenal, the W-88, was obtained by China, in part\nthrough espionage. The W-88 warhead was designed at Los Alamos.\n\n   After Lee was fired, investigators found evidence that he had\ntransferred vast amounts of secret nuclear data from the classified\nsystem at Los Alamos into an unclassified system. In a televised\ninterview, Lee acknowledged that he transferred the data, but said\nhe did so to protect the material from being lost in computer\ncrashes.\n\n   Since the investigation into Lee became public, a furious debate\nhas erupted over whether the inquiry was properly handled by the\nEnergy Department and the FBI. Subsequently, FBI officials said\nthat the initial inquiry into the evidence of Chinese atomic\nespionage was flawed, and other current and former government\nofficials argued that investigators had focused prematurely on Lee\nwithout first determining how widely accessible the information on\nthe W-88 warhead had been at the time officials concluded the\nChinese obtained it. Asian-American groups rallied to Lee's cause,\nsaying he was the victim of racial stereotyping.\n\n   In September, Reno and Freeh ordered federal agents to broaden\ntheir investigation into the evidence of China's theft of W-88\nsecrets, moving beyond Los Alamos to look at other labs and defense\ncontractors that may have had access to the data.\n\n   nn\n\n   But even as that broader inquiry into evidence of Chinese\nespionage is continuing, the government has been moving forward in\nits investigation of Lee over allegations of unauthorized computer\ntransfers of nuclear secrets.\n\n   In addition to the unauthorized transfers of nuclear data into\nan unclassified computer system at Los Alamos, government\ninvestigators now believe that Lee also copied the nuclear secrets\nonto computer tapes and took those tapes out of the lab, officials\nsaid. The FBI cannot account for those missing computer tapes,\nofficials said. Officials have no evidence that the tapes have been\nhanded over to any other unauthorized individuals, however.\n\n   The recent discovery of the missing computer tapes appears to\nhave convinced government officials that the evidence against Lee\nmay be more serious than initially believed. Stephen Younger,\nassociate laboratory director for nuclear weapons, who oversees the\ndivision where Lee worked, has completed a highly classified\nanalysis of Lee's computer activities that shows that the potential\ndamage to national security could be extensive, officials said.\n\n   If he is charged in the computer downloading case, Lee's\nattorneys appear likely to respond by saying that he is the victim\nof selective prosecution for relatively common practices.
