Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four\npolice officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already\ntaking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and\nexperts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based\non entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.\n\n   Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole\nincident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often\nfuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a\ncrucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.\n\n   Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing\nquestions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in\nfusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx\napartment building.\n\n   Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting?\nHow quickly did he fall?
