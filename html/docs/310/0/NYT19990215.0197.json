(af)  \n By HENRY FOUNTAIN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Anyone who has ever had too much to do and too little time to do\nit knows the feeling: So much more could be accomplished if there\nwere some way to be asleep and awake at the same time.\n\n   Birds have figured out a way to do just that. They can sleep\nwith one eye open and with one half of the brain awake. The\nphenomenon, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, is thought to\nallow a snoozing bird to detect an approaching predator _ literally\nkeeping an eye out for the enemy.\n\n   Now, researchers at Indiana State University have shown that\nbirds can increase the amount of time they spend in unihemispheric\nsleep if there is a greater risk from predators. It is the first\nevidence, the scientists say, of an animal's controlling sleep and\nwakefulness in different parts of the brain at the same time.\n\n   The researchers, who reported on their study in a recent issue\nof Nature, worked with mallard ducks in groups of four, lined up in\na row. The birds on the outside in each group _ more exposed to any\npotential predator _ spent more than twice the amount of time in\nunihemispheric sleep than those in the center.\n\n   And during such sleep, the outside birds kept their outside eye\nopen more than 85 percent of the time. Birds in the center, though,\nshowed no preference for which eye they kept open.   \n  \n\n   ---   \n  \n\n   Home buyers are usually warned about the dangers of radon, a\nnaturally occurring radioactive gas that can build up inside a\ntightly sealed home.\n\n   Alpha particle radiation as the gas decays can damage the DNA in\nlung tissue, potentially causing cancer.\n\n   But the extent of the threat is a subject of some debate.\nBecause the level of radon in homes is low, estimates of the hazard\nhave been made by extrapolating from studies of uranium miners, who\nare exposed to much higher levels of the gas. But a new study,\ndetailed in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\nshows that such extrapolation may overestimate the hazard in homes.\n\n   In high-level exposure, as in a mine, a single cell of lung\ntissue is hit by many alpha particles. But in a low-level\nsituation, a cell is only very rarely hit by more than one\nparticle. The problem for researchers has been to determine the\ncancer-causing effect of one-particle bombardment.\n\n   In the new study, researchers from Columbia University used a\ndevice called a charged-particle microbeam, which is capable of\nirradiating individual cell nuclei with a specific number of alpha\nparticles. By irradiating thousands of lung-tissue cells from mice\nwith exactly one particle each, the researchers determined that the\nfrequency of DNA damage was quite low.   \n  \n\n   ---   \n  \n\n   In the realm of high-fiber diets, the termite takes the cake,\neating all wood all the time.
