The fierce\nwinds shoved cars around, snapped palm trees in half and set car\nalarms screeching throughout the capital of Nassau.\n\n   Extensive damage reports and possible injuries or fatalities\ncould not be easily determined because most communication to the\nislands was lost.\n\n   But this much is already known about Floyd: It's one of the\nworst storms many long-time weather-watchers can remember. By the\ntime it becomes a mere whisper, Floyd may go down as one of the\nlargest and most destructive storms to hit the United States.\n\n   ''This is a very dangerous storm,'' said Jeremy Pennington, a\nmeteorologist with the National Hurricane Center. ''We don't see\nmany category 4 intensity storms striking the U.S. mainland, and\ncertainly not one as large as this.''\n\n   A clerk at the Avis rental car counter at Orlando International\nAirport summed it best when she told a customer, ``Things that are\nstanding today aren't going to be standing tomorrow.''\n\n   Just how much is still standing in the Bahamas remains to be\nseen, perhaps as early as today. Bahamian defense officials met\nTuesday to plan cleanup and relief efforts, and all defense\npersonnel were ordered to report to duty this morning, according to\nradio reports from the islands.\n\n   President Clinton did not wait for the storm to hit U.S. soil to\nissue a pre-emptive disaster declaration for Florida and Georgia.\n\n   The early declaration ``enables state and local governments to\nget equipment and other things ... in place to begin recovery\nefforts at the earliest possible moment,'' White House spokesman\nBarry Toiv said in Washington.\n\n   In Florida, one computer model places Floyd just offshore from\nDaytona Beach by noon _ just 30 minutes before high tide _ and then\n40 miles east of Jacksonville, perhaps by 9 p.m. Landfall could\ncome by midnight on the Georgia-South Carolina border.\n\n   An indication of how seriously Floyd is being taken could be\nfound Tuesday at a deserted Disney World, which closed its gates\ndue to weather for the first time in its 28-year history.\n\n   With a storm that is more than 500 miles wide, hurricane-force\nwinds of at least 74 mph could reach as far inland as Orlando,\nwhich is 60 miles west of Daytona Beach.\n\n   Orange County Commission Chairman Mel Martinez, whose community\nincludes Disney World and other theme parks, urged evacuation _ and\nprayer.\n\n   ``We should call for higher help,'' Martinez said.\n\n   Daytona Beach construction worker Rick Ross placed his faith in\nplywood and nails. The 40-year-old lives just west of the Atlantic\nOcean, which crept a block closer to the Daytona Beach shore than\nusual by Tuesday afternoon _ and Floyd was still 300 miles away.\n\n   From a playground parking lot overlooking the frothing,\nwhite-capped ocean, Ross watched the thundering surf with his black\nlabrador-chow-shepherd mix, Rock.\n\n   ``I live right up the street. Everything I own is there,'' Ross\nsaid. ``I'm not going to leave it.''\n\n   Ross, who has lived in Daytona since 1974, stayed despite a\nmandatory evacuation that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n   ``We've been through a couple of these,'' he said. ``We think\nwe'll be all right.''\n\n   Along Central Florida's Space Coast, the streets of small beach\ntowns from Melbourne north to the Kennedy Space Center were empty\nof all but the last stragglers, who motored through blustery winds\non their way to bridges leading to the mainland. Mandatory\nevacuation orders were issued Monday, and heavy traffic choked\nhighways leading west toward Orlando all Monday night and into the\nday Tuesday.\n\n   Businesses were boarded up with plywood, along with houses\nfacing the ocean.\n\n   ``The storm is wobbling, and if that wobble comes our way, we\ncould get it full-bore,'' said Bob Scales, a Cocoa Beach resident\nwho fled to Orlando with his wife and two young children. Scales\nleft behind the home he bought two years ago, a 40-year-old block\nstructure that survived Hurricane Erin in 1995.\n\n   ``But the previous owners added a second roof, and it's not tied\ndown too well,'' he said. ``You do all you can, but if that roof\nblows, it's history.''\n\n   A big worry on the barrier island was storm surge. In Cocoa\nBeach, State Road A1A skirts just along the top of the dune line,\nwith one row of homes perched just over the beach, most about 10 to\n15 feet above the waterline.\n\n   By mid-day Tuesday, huge waves were pounding the dune, splashing\nfoam and sea mist onto the beachfront houses. Chronic erosion\nproblems have left many homeowners with little more than sea walls\nto protect their property.\n\n   ``It's breaking a mile out already,'' said Mike Brown, 48, who\nruns a small cleaning business in Cocoa Beach and lives one block\nfrom the ocean. ``It's looking like it wants to top the dune.''\n\n   The phones at NASA's press center rang unanswered Tuesday, as\nmedia spokesman had apparently evacuated, along with the 12,500\nworkers at the space center.\n\n   The space agency had all four space shuttles _ worth $2 billion\neach _ inside hangars, but officials worried that the buildings are\nnot capable of withstanding winds of more than around 125 mph.\nAnother worry was that four unmanned rockets were already on launch\npads and could not be moved to safety.\n\n   Workers placed protective towers around the rockets and secured\nthem to their pads as best they could.\n\n   There were also fears that rising waters from Floyd's storm\nsurge might inundate the facility. Most of the launch complex and\nprocessing buildings are less than 10 feet above sea level, and\nforecasters said Floyd's 155 mph winds might kick up waves of 20\nfeet or more.\n\n   ``If it's a direct hit on us, or even a skirting hit, we could\nlose a great deal,'' said Bruce Buckingham, another NASA spokesman.\n\n   About 200 miles up the coast, lifelong St. Simons Island, Ga.,\nresident Jamie Gould IV said he will ride out Floyd on the\nlow-lying barrier island. The Gould family has seen storms: Gould's\ngreat-great grandfather built the island's landmark lighthouse more\nthan a century ago.\n\n   Gould said he disobeyed a mandatory evacution order that went\ninto effect for Glynn County, Ga., around noon Tuesday because an\nelderly neighbor with cancer could not be budged from his home.\n\n   ''I can't leave Mr. Jimmy,'' Gould said. ''We'll be all right.''\n\n   By late Tuesday, however, most of the island's 18,000 year-round\nresidents and more than a few late summer vacationers had crossed\nthe four-mile long causeway to the mainland on the first leg of\nwhat quickly became a crowded trip west.\n\n   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for the\nentire coast Tuesday. Gale-force winds were expected to begin\nraking St. Simons around dawn today and winds as high as 125 miles\nan hour could hit by this evening, said Ed Abel, Glynn's emergency\nmanagement director.\n\n   Abel said barrier islands and low-lying areas could be awash and\nbattered by wind-driven waves if the storm surge reaches its\nprojected 9 to 15 feet over mean sea level. The storm's dangerous\neye wall, he said, was projected to pass within five miles of the\nGeorgia coast.\n\n   During the afternoon Tuesday, most islanders packed their cars,\nmoved patio furniture indoors, boarded or taped windows and headed\nwest.\n\n   Darlene McCabe, a computer teacher at Glynn Middle School in\nBrunswick, finished her packing and played Frisbee at an island\npark with friends.\n\n   ''I'm having to leave all my house plants, my yard sale\ntreasures and my three cats behind,'' she said.\n\n   McCabe said she fears the hurricane will devastate the island's\nmagnificent live oak forest.\n\n   ''Take a good, long look at these trees,'' she said. ''I just\nhope they'll be here when we come back.''\n\n   Anticipation also was felt in South Carolina, where Charleston\nMayor Joseph Riley declared a state of emergency. Starting today,\nthe city will be under curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.\n\n   Riley spent Tuesday warning that Floyd threatens to flood\nlow-lying areas spared by Hugo in 1989. Hugo's eye passed over\nCharleston, hurling its most punishing northeastern winds out in\nthe Atlantic.\n\n   If Floyd makes landfall southwest of Charleston, near Beaufort\nand Edisto Island, tidal surges of 12 to 18 feet could hit\nCharleston, Riley said.\n\n   The city's mayor for 23 years, Riley is particularly worried\nthat residents of Charleston's West of the Ashley and of rural\nareas between Charleston and Beaufort don't appreciate the possible\ndanger.\n\n   Riley, 56, said Floyd is following a course similar to a\nhurricane in 1893 that killed 1,500 to 2,000 people in coastal\nSouth Carolina.\n\n   ``The real killer is the surge, the almost instaneous rush of\nwater into areas where people do not expect it,'' Riley said.\n``They do not call this the low country for nothing.''\n\n   Plywood covered the tall arched windows of Charleston's City\nHall and other historic buildings.\n\n   ``Floyd go back to Mayberry,'' read a message scrawled on a\nboard over the window of the Four Corners Cafe on Broad Street.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's day of reckoning starts this\nmorning.\n","\n   If predictions for the path of Hurricane Floyd hold true, the\ncenter of the storm _ where sustained winds are circulating at 140\nmph _ could come within 30 miles of the central Florida coast this\nmorning, as early as 9 a.m.\n","\n   By that time, places like Melbourne and Cape Canaveral may be\nwhipped by winds of up to 100 mph and a potential storm surge of 15\nfeet.\n","\n   The Bahamas felt the full fury of Floyd on Monday, as the\nhurricane easily uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,\nhorizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets.
