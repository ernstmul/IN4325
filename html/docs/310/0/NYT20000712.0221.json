LEWIS   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   HELSINKI, Finland _ It is time for the ``SMS Dating Game'' on\nRadio X3M. Romance is in the airwaves, and Cupid carries a cell\nphone. Thumbs ready? In 160 characters or less, use the keypad on\nyour mobile phone to type a description of yourself and your\ninterests, and send it to the disc jockey's phone using the wildly\npopular Short Messaging Service.\n\n   In minutes, if your description catches the fancy of another\nmobile phone user _ and the odds are good, considering that most\nFinns over age 15 carry a wireless phone _ the phone will chirp,\nwarble, vibrate or beep out a riff from a popular rock song,\nsignaling that you have a text reply waiting on your phone.\n\n   ``Apparently it's more fun than actually talking to the other\nperson,'' said Richard Nordgren, head of programming for Radio X3M.\n\n   But that is nothing compared with what's planned in Sweden,\nwhere a company is developing a mobile Internet dating service that\ntracks the location of the phone. When two seemingly compatible\npeople come into range of each other, the dating service will alert\nthem by phone, enabling them to arrange a rendezvous.\n\n   Although it is indisputably the business leader in personal\ncomputer and Internet technologies, the United States is Old World\nwhen it comes to what many analysts and entrepreneurs see as the\nnext big wave of technology: wireless Internet communications.\n\n   Market researchers are nearly unanimous in predicting that in\nthree years more people around the world will gain access to the\nInternet through mobile devices than through personal computers.\nBut to preview this transformation, which some call the ``mobile\nlifestyle,'' one has to leave the United States.\n\n   ``You're just starting to see it in the U.S., but here it is\neverywhere,'' said Rolf Skoglund, a venture capitalist in\nStockholm, Sweden.\n\n   According to the market research company International Data\nCorp., Sweden has passed the United States and is now the world's\ndominant ``information economy,'' measured in terms of the\npercentage of citizens who have access to computers, the Internet,\nwireless phones and other information technologies. Finland, Norway\nand Denmark round out the top five.\n\n   The Nordic countries are digital Valhalla, the forefront of the\nnew information economy based on wireless communications. As a\nresult, U.S. technology companies and venture capitalists are\nrushing to set up or expand their offices in the growing high-tech\ncenters near Helsinki and Stockholm. Microsoft opened a new\nresearch and development office in Stockholm last month, as did\nMotorola.\n\n   ``All of the best companies are being forced into setting up\nsites in Europe or Japan, where they have working test beds to\nproceed with critical development,'' said Mark R. Anderson, a\ntechnology analyst who recently returned from touring northern\nEurope. ``There's a reason why all these people are rushing over to\nSweden. They have no choice. It could be that the wireless markets\nwon't appear here in the United States for years after the markets\nare mature in Sweden and in Japan and in China.''\n\n   The Nordic countries are also in the vanguard of mobile\nelectronic commerce, or m-commerce. Although it is still a novelty,\npeople in Finland are beginning to use their phones to pay for soft\ndrinks from a vending machine, for parking and for car washes. In\nSweden, trials are under way to allow people to check train\nschedules and to book and pay for tickets by phone. An\nadvertisement in Stockholm shows a shopkeeper asking, ``Will that\nbe cash or phone?''\n\n   In Finland, it is difficult to find any young people who have a\nfriend or relative who does not have a mobile phone. In fact, the\nquestion seemed to startle almost everyone, as if they had been\nasked whether they had friends who rode reindeer. Finally, after\npausing a moment to contemplate the question, one Finn said: ``Yes,\nmy grandmother. But she is 83.''\n\n   Such things are inevitable in a culture in which last year 78\npercent of the country's 2.35 million households had at least one\nmobile phone, according to Statistics Finland, a research company.\nAbout one household in four no longer even has a traditional wired\nphone, relying entirely on mobile phones. The report stated,\n``nearly all Finns aged between 15 and 39 used the mobile phone.''\n\n   The mobile lifestyle is only slightly more subdued in Sweden.\n``Why would you be glued to a wall to talk to someone?'' asked\nCyril Holm, a young entrepreneur in Stockholm who carried a phone\nwith a built-in keyboard. ``What a terrible, stinking idea.''\n\n   But why Scandinavia, and not the United States, which views\nitself as the center of the technology revolution?\n\n   Several factors came together to make this the forefront of\nmobile telephones: an extremely high penetration of wireless phones\namong consumers, estimated as high as 70 percent among people over\n10 years of age; the aggressive growth of wireless system operators\nlike Telia and Sonera; and the headquarters of two of the biggest\nmakers of mobile phones and equipment, Nokia in Finland and\nEricsson in Sweden.\n\n   Technology experts in Scandinavia offer several other\nexplanations. Part of the answer is geography. The Nordic countries\nare relatively large and remote, fostering the need for reliable\ncommunications. And beginning in the 1980s, the Scandinavian\ncountries agreed on a common mobile phone standard, which evolved\ninto GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications. The United\nStates, meanwhile, uses two incompatible standards, called TDMA and\nCDMA. Some carriers in the United States use a variant of GSM, but\nit uses a different frequency and is incompatible with the global\nstandard, which has been adopted by 105 countries.\n\n   nn\n\n   On a practical level, it means that most Americans cannot use\ntheir phones overseas, while someone in Estonia can call easily\nfrom London or Rome without needing a new phone.\n\n   Another impediment is the curious U.S. billing system in which\nthe recipient of a mobile call pays the toll, which is just the\nopposite of the European standard. The effect is that many\nAmericans keep their phones turned off, unless they are expecting a\ncall, and carry pagers instead. In Scandinavia, where the caller\npays, phones are left on all the time and thus are used more.\n\n   ``I haven't seen a pager for years,'' said Antti Laaksonen, a\nyoung programmer who is working to develop entertainment services\nfor a new generation of cell phones. The last company in Finland to\noffer pagers recently closed its service, succumbing to the SMS\nphenomenon.\n\n   In the United States, there is no way to distinguish between a\nmobile phone number and a fixed line number. They have the same\nnumber of digits. In Scandinavia, mobile numbers have an extra\ndigit, so a caller can tell at a glance whether the other's\nperson's phone is in his pocket or on his desk.\n\n   But more than all this, it appears that the idea of mobility has\ncaught fire here in digital Valhalla in a way that even the highly\nmobile American society has not grasped.\n\n   The use of phones for nonverbal communication is one of the more\nstriking differences between Europe and the United States. Finland,\nwith a population of about 5 million, sends 75 million SMS messages\na month. SMS allows people to send up to 160 characters of text to\nanother phone, with the message displayed on the phone's tiny\nscreen.\n\n   It typically costs the equivalent of 15 cents to 20 cents to\nsend a message and nothing to receive one, unless you subscribe to\none of the many SMS services, like the joke of the day or a daily\nhoroscope, which are among the most popular services. Despite the\ncost, SMS is a cultural phenomenon among young people, who appear\nto possess an uncanny ability to type swiftly using their thumbs on\nthe phone's tiny keypad.\n\n   Of course, the phones can be set to vibrate silently instead of\nring, which has led to a new problem: Some schoolteachers have\ncomplained that students are using their phones to send test\nanswers to one another in class.\n\n   Esa Puokannen, a Finn who studied at the University of Texas,\nsaid that in his family only his 8-year-old does not carry a phone.\nHis 12-year-old son got a phone and ran up a tab of 400 markaa\n(more than $60) the first month sending SMS messages to his\nfriends.
