So they have focused on implanting healthy cells in\nbrains of people with disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, that\nare caused by damage to small, circumscribed areas of brain cells.\n\n   But in a new report, researchers at Children's Hospital and\nHarvard Medical School say they may have overcome that longstanding\nbarrier, at least in an animal model. They injected versatile\nneural ``stem cells'' into newborn mice with widespread brain\ndamage that made them shiver uncontrollably.\n\n   Surprisingly, the stem cells _ ``progenitor'' cells with\noffspring that can be any kind of brain cell _ migrated throughout\nthe brain. And, responding to some precise but unknown signal, they\nspawned the exact kind of cell the mouse brains lacked and repaired\nthe nerve damage. The report says that the repairs dramatically\nreduced the shaking in 60 percent of the animals.\n\n   The report is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences. The authors are Drs. Booma D. Yandava, Lori L.\nBillinghurst, and Evan Y. Snyder.\n\n   ``It's exciting. I'm very positive about this,'' said Ronald\nMcKay, a scientist at the National Institute of Neurological\nDisorders and Stroke, which is helping finance the research. ``It's\nnot a cure for multiple sclerosis, and it's not in (mice) adults,\nbut it's a very interesting step'' in the effort to engineer cells\nto repair a wide range of brain disorders and injuries.\n\n   Snyder, the senior author, said although clinical tests in\npeople are years away, he has begun putting human neural stem cells\ninto mice in experiments designed to show that human cells have the\nsame ability to migrate all over the brain.\n\n   The key player in this process, the neural stem cell, is a\n``totipotential'' cell that hasn't become committed to any\nparticular role, and can spawn all kinds of brain cells _ including\nmore stem cells. Scientists have found stem cells (of different\nkinds, depending on the organ they reside in) in many other organs\nof the body. In addition, researchers recently isolated embryonic\nstem cells that form soon after conception, which can give rise to\nany type of cell in the body.\n\n   Although stem cells are abundant in the developing fetus, they\nalso can be found in adult human and animal brains, Snyder said.\nThe discovery of neural stem cells in the last decade suggested\nthat here was a source of healthy new cells to repair damage _ much\nas blood stem cells are transplanted into patients whose own\nblood-forming bone marrow cells have been destroyed by disease or\nby cancer chemotherapy. ``This is like a bone marrow transplant for\nthe brain,'' said Snyder, who is an assistant professor of\nneurology in the pediatrics department at Children's.\n\n   The neural stem cells for the experiment came from the brains of\n4-day-old mice. They were implanted into a strain of mice known as\n``shiverers'' because of their constant shakiness: The cause is a\ngene mutation that results in many nerve cells lacking the normal\nsheath of myelin, a protein that acts like the insulation on an\nelectric line. Multiple sclerosis, an often progressive and\ndisabling disease, also is caused by a lack of myelin sheathing on\nnerves.\n\n   Snyder said he implanted the neural stem cells into the sick\nmice just after they were born because at that stage neural stem\ncells are normally migrating throughout the developing brain.\nTherefore, it was more likely that the implanted cells would spread\nthrough the brain tissue and make repairs.\n\n   The stem cells differentiated into the kind of cells, called\noligodendrocytes, that were missing in the ``shiverer'' mice.\nSnyder said the results suggested that the brains somehow signaled\nto the stem cells that oligodendrocytes were needed.\n","Headline":"\nBRAIN REVEALS POWER TO REPAIR ITSELF \n","Text":["\n   Boston scientists, experimenting on mice, have shown that they\ncan repair widespread brain damage by implanting a kind of\nuncommitted, all-purpose ``stem cell'' that migrates through the\nbrain and spawns the needed replacement cells.\n","\n   The findings raise new hopes for treating devastating conditions\nsuch as multiple sclerosis and diseases that cause severe\nretardation in children, and possibly Alzheimer's disease and other\ndegenerative brain disorders and strokes.\n","\n   All these problems result from the death or absence of, or\ndamage to, neurons, the nerve cells that make up the ``white\nmatter'' of the brain.\n","\n   Until now, scientists thought it would be difficult, if not\nimpossible, to replace malfunctioning cells scattered throughout\nthe brain.
