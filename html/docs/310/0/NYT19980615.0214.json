Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Mathematicians have found a simple explanation for\nhow big worlds can be turned into small worlds, a phenomenon summed\nup in the popular belief that anyone on earth can be linked to\nanyone else by a chain of only six other people _ the so-called six\ndegrees of separation.\n\n   Any large set of linked, dynamic components _ be they people,\nelectric power stations, brain cells or whatever _ can be\ntransformed into a small world, the mathematicians said, by\nintroducing short cuts between a few components. Relatively few\nshort cuts can make big changes in a network, linking clusters of\npeople, power stations or brain cells together in unexpected ways.\n\n   Among people, the short cuts are well-connected individuals _\nthose who know many people from other countries, different\ndisciplines or unusual subcultures. Such highly connected people\nestablish surprising interconnections between groups that seem\nimpossibly distant from one another, like Iowa farmers and Kalahari\nbushmen. For example, sometimes a farmer's son will join the Peace\nCorps in Africa and thus unexpected links are born.\n\n   This kind of interconnectedness is familiar to social animals\nlike humans but now, for the first time, mathematicians have\nquantified it in a general model.\n\n   The finding, which is the first mathematical explanation of the\nsmall world phenomenon in dynamical systems, was reported in the\nJune 4 issue of the journal Nature. The mathematical experiments\nwere done by Steven Strogatz, a mathematician at Cornell\nUniversity, and Duncan Watts, a postdoctoral fellow in the social\nsciences at Columbia University.\n\n   ``They have made a great contribution to understanding small\nworld effects,'' said James Collins, a mathematician at the Center\nfor Biodynamics at Boston University. ``The phenomenon has been\nmostly studied by sociologists and psychologists, but the\nmathematics community had not explored these networks in terms of\nself-organizing systems.''\n\n   Such systems include social networks, technologies like the\nInternet and electric power grids, and life in general _ the fact\nthat a sperm can penetrate an egg and set into play a series of\nbiological processes that give rise to complex creatures from mere\nspecks of protoplasm.\n\n   The finding that short cuts make all the difference explains why\ntotal strangers can quickly determine that they have acquaintances\nin common, why epidemics spread so rapidly in the modern world and\nmay be useful in improving communication systems like cellular\ntelephones and the Internet.\n\n   ``There's a unifying mechanism in nature that makes things small\nand interconnected,'' Strogatz said.\n\n   But could it be modeled mathematically? To find out, the\nresearchers focused attention on two extreme types of networks. One\nis a simple geometric lattice in the shape of a ring, with each\nnode connected locally to its neighbors. Like a pure crystal, this\nlattice is highly ordered. The distance from one node to the next\nis characteristically long, and nodes tend to cluster tightly in\nneighborhoods.\n\n   The second model is a ringed lattice with the nodes connected\nrandomly. The distance from one node to the next is\ncharacteristically shorter, but because everything is connected\nhelter-skelter, there is very little order and nodes do not fall\ninto common clusters.\n\n   Most biological, technological and social networks lie between\nthese two extremes of ordered versus random connections. ``We\nasked, what would happen if you take an ordered lattice and rewire\nsome of the nodes, introducing short cuts?'' Watts said. ``You'd be\nmaking a regular network slightly more random by connecting nodes\nthat would not normally be connected.''\n\n   For example, in a regular network each node is connected only to\nits immediate neighbors _ like people in a rural village who rarely\nleave home and only know the people next door. But if one of those\nvillagers travels to the big city, adding one distant link to all\nthe close links at home, the village is connected to the wider\nworld.\n\n   The results were astonishing, Watts said. The properties of the\nlattice change dramatically. It still forms clusters, but the\npathways between clusters are much shorter. Immediate neighborhoods\nand more distant neighborhoods are suddenly closer together.\nInformation spreads more quickly. Each node has access to more\ninformation and can do more things. In being connected to more\nneighbors, nodes begin to cooperate and synchronize.\n\n   The huge surprise is that it takes very few short cuts between\nnodes and clusters to turn a big world into a small world, Watts\nsaid. After a point, adding more short cuts does not improve\nnetwork efficiency.\n\n   To find out if their abstract mathematical model applied to the\nreal world, the researchers looked at three systems whose elements\nhave been mapped completely _ the power transmission grid of the\nwestern United States, the 282 neurons that make up the nervous\nsystem of a simple worm called Caenorhabditis elegans, and the\nnearly 250,000 actors listed in the Internet Movie Database.\n\n   Each is a small world whose elements are closely connected to\nneighboring elements _ one power station to the next, one cell to\nanother and one actor to another actor who tends to be cast in the\nsame kind of films, Watts said.\n\n   Such worlds could be random but they are not. They have a great\ndeal of structure, which is created by short cuts between a few\npower stations, a few special cells in the nervous system or\ncertain prominent actors who make a lot of movies, Watts said.\nThese short cuts can be identified and measured, which means that\nthey act as a unifying principle for small worlds in general.\n\n   nn\n\n   The finding of what difference a few short cuts can make has\nradical implications for people, Watts said. Most people know only\ntheir immediate neighbors and friends but a few people are\nwell-connected. They cross geographic, social and political\nboundaries and make the world seem smaller.\n\n   For example, if you knew Secretary of State Madeline Albright,\nyou would be connected to everyone she knows, including kings and\nqueens. But even if you are not her friend, you may be connected to\nher indirectly. Perhaps your neighbor's daughter-in-law was Ms.\nAlbright's college roommate. If so, you would be connected to the\nQueen of England by three degrees of separation.\n\n   The notion that all people are connected through indirect\nnetworks was first studied by the Stanley Milgram, a social\npsychologist at Harvard University who in 1967 asked people in\nNebraska and Kansas to mail a letter to two people in Boston with\nwhom they were not acquainted. They were to forward the letter to\nfriends who might know the Boston people.\n\n   The average number of intermediaries between the Midwesterners\nand the Bostonians was six, a finding that was popularized in the\n1990 in the play ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' by John Guare. The\nplay and a subsequent movie were based on the notion that everyone\nin the world is connected to everyone else through a chain of at\nmost six acquaintances. If two people have one mutual acquaintance\nthey have one degree of separation. Subsequent degrees of\nseparation are based on the number of people needed to make the\nlink.\n\n   A few years ago, college students embraced a game called ``Six\nDegrees of Kevin Bacon,'' in which they linked the actor to other\nactors through as few links as possible. The Oracle of Bacon at\nVirginia, a Web site created by Brett Tjaden, now links 322,095\nactors to Bacon, assigning each a Bacon score. Because Bacon has\nappeared in so many films, most actors have low Bacon scores.\n\n   The game can also be played with a relative newcomer like\nLeonardo DiCaprio. For example, DiCaprio was in ``Les Cent et Une\nNuits'' (1995) with Harrison Ford, who was in ``Apocalypse Now''\n(1979) with Marlon Brando, who was in ``Countess from Hong Kong''\n(1967) with Charlie Chaplin. Thus, Chaplin has a DiCaprio score of\nthree.\n\n   Short cuts can have positive or negative effects on society,\nWatts said. When human populations were isolated centuries ago,\ndisease epidemics would be localized. But add jet travel _ a short\ncut _ and the world becomes smaller. Many experts believe that AIDS\nwas first spread to the United States from Africa through an\ninfected airline attendant who introduced the virus into gay\nbathhouses in New York. ``Infectious diseases spread more quickly\nand easily in a small world, and it is alarming how few short cuts\nare needed to make the world small,'' Strogatz said.\n\n   On the other hand, short cuts can make networks more efficient.\nOne might improve the efficiency of cell phone networks by\ndeliberately introducing a few random connections between nodes, or\nphones, Collins said.
