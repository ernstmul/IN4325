(af)  \n By RONALD SMOTHERS   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ When the guards came to his cell on Monday night,\nhe held out his arms for the manacles as usual.\n\n   But when he heard the whispered words ``Pack up'' and was led\nout of the Hudson County Correctional Center to the cold, empty\nstreet, Hany Kiareldeen realized that his long, dark odyssey\nthrough the immigration system was over.\n\n   Kiareldeen, 31, a Palestinian immigrant, was released Monday\nnight after a 19-month sojourn in two New Jersey jails. He had been\ndetained on the basis of secret evidence alleging that he had links\nto terrorists, including one of the men convicted in the 1993 World\nTrade Center bombing.\n\n   A series of immigration court and federal court rulings had\nfound that the evidence was unreliable and that its use was\nunconstitutional, and on Monday the Immigration and Naturalization\nService decided to stop fighting judges' orders that Kiareldeen be\nfreed.\n\n   His release and the court rulings have given hope to supporters\nof some 20 other people of Arab descent being held on secret\nevidence from anonymous sources that the immigration agency will\nfinally have to scrap a practice it has used since the '50s.\n\n   Kiareldeen also hopes for such a big change, but Tuesday,\nreeling from the legal ordeal that at first seemed destined to end\nin his deportation, he was still trying to make sense of the\npersonal and political drama that has left his life in tatters but\nhis faith in justice intact.\n\n   ``I wasn't worried a lot while in prison, because I was almost\nsure that this was how it should end up, because I was sure justice\nwould win out,'' he said in an interview in Newark.\n\n   He then turned somber when asked about the government's\nallegations, the evidence for which he was never allowed to see,\nexcept for sketchy summaries. He and his lawyer have asserted that\nthe charges _ including accusations that he threatened the life of\nAttorney General Janet Reno _ were based on the statements of an\nembittered former wife who talked to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigations Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n   ``It has damaged me a lot and it has damaged some\nrelationships,'' said Kiareldeen, who has lived in the United\nStates since 1990 and who worked in an electronics store before he\nwas jailed. ``I have to reconstruct my life.''\n\n   ``Bittersweet'' was how some immigrant advocates and\nArab-American groups described the release of Kiareldeen, as they\ntook note of the continued detention of others.\n\n   ``But I'm hoping this case will initiate the government's taking\na closer look at what they use as secret evidence, and becoming a\nlot more judicious in light of the loss in this case at so many\nadministrative and judicial levels,'' said Kit Gage, national\ncoordinator of the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom,\na coalition of advocacy groups and ethnic and civil rights groups\nthat came together to oppose the use of secret evidence and other\nimmigration law provisions.\n\n   Aly R. Abuzaakouk, the executive director of the American Muslim\nCouncil, while applauding the release of Kiareldeen, said he\nbelieved it would not, on its own, force the immigration agency to\nrethink its use of the classified evidence to detain, deport,\nexclude and deny asylum to immigrants.\n\n   He said the only thing that would end those practices and repair\nthe damage they had done to Arab-Americans and Muslims would be the\npassage of a bill now before Congress that would outlaw the use of\nsecret evidence.\n\n   ``People in our community are aware of secret evidence, and it\nis having a chilling effect on their expressing themselves on\nissues,'' Abuzaakouk said. ``It has created an intimidating factor,\nand I don't think INS will pull back on its own.''\n\n   Donald Mueller, a spokesman for the the immigration service,\nsaid the agency's decision to release Kiareldeen did not mean that\nit would abandon the use of secret evidence altogether. He said the\nservice had concluded, as had other units in the Justice Department\nthat deal with immigration cases, that the evidence against\nKiareldeen was not credible and had been effectively rebutted by\nhis lawyers.\n\n   A spokesman for Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said he was\npursuing discussions with the Justice Department about\n``administrative changes'' in the use of secret evidence. But Rep.\nDavid E. Bonior, D-Mich., and the prime sponsor of the Secret\nEvidence Repeal Act of 1999, said the only effective solution would\nbe to eradicate the practice.\n\n   ``Hany's Kiareldeen's release will be a hollow victory unless we\npermanently discard this law,'' he said Tuesday in an interview,\nreferring to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act as\nwell as the Immigration Reform Act, both of 1996.\n\n   Kiareldeen said he had dreamed about being released every night\nduring his incarceration, but he never thought it would come\nunheralded and almost ignominiously, near midnight.\n\n   ``I thought it would be in daylight with all my family around\nand with an apology from the INS,'' he said, still slightly dazed.\n\n   But he said that he was not so bitter about his experience that\nhe would abandon his plans to seek American citizenship. And while\nhe was not converted to political activism by his time in\ndetention, he does plan to visit Washington this week to appear at\na press conference with Bonior in support of his bill. Â \n\n   After his release, 19 months to the day from when he was\narrested, Kiareldeen joined one of his lawyers, Regis Fernandez,\nhis brother, his sister-in-law, Lily, and a friend for a noisy\ncelebration in the parking lot of the Hudson County jail, complete\nwith loud Arab music, a bottle of his favorite beer, Corona, and\nmuch laughing and hugging. Then it was off to his brother's house\nfor the first nonprison food, or Arab food, he has had in a year\nand half: grape leaves stuffed with rice and chicken.\n\n   In a news conference Tuesday with Kiareldeen, his lawyers _\nDavid Cole, Houieda Saad and Fernandez _ recounted how their first\nvictory in the case came in April, when an immigration judge,\nDaniel Meisner, upheld their client's contention that he was\neligible for a green card. Meisner, an administrative law judge,\nhad himself viewed the secret evidence in its entirety and found it\nunconvincing.\n\n   Working with sketchy summaries of that same secret evidence\nagainst their client, Ms. Saad said they were able to mount a\ndefense built on documents, rent checks, telephone records and\ntestimony. Among other things, they said, they proved that\nKiareldeen was not politically active or an observant Muslim, as\nthose convicted in the bombings were, and even frequented go-go\nbars when he was single. This became known, Fernandez said\njokingly, as ``the go-go bar defense.''\n\n   They also proved to the judge's satisfaction that Kiareldeen did\nnot live where the secret evidence said he lived when he was said\nto have met with one of the World Trade Center bombers, and that he\nhad none of the extensive telephone contacts with the conspirators\nthat had been such key evidence in the government's successful\nprosecution of the bombing conspirators.\n\n   Cole, a volunteer lawyer with the Center for Constitutional\nRights and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said\nthat what turned the tide for Kiareldeen was the immigration board\nrulings _ upheld on appeal to the Board of Immigration appeals _\nand a federal district court ruling last week. In the decision,\nJudge William H. Walls said that detention on the basis of secret\nevidence was a violation of due process.\n\n   That ruling, the first ever to find the detention practice\nunconstitutional, broke with several rulings in the 1950s that\nseemed to justify the use of such evidence. Cole said Walls had\nfollowed the reasoning of several more recent cases, which had\noutlawed the use of secret evidence in other types of immigration\nproceedings.\n\n   He applauded the INS commissioner, Doris Meissner, for not\ncontinuing to pursue appeals. But he said that he first had to\napplaud Kiareldeen himself for fighting the use of secret evidence\nrather than submitting to deportation, as had so many other\nimmigrants.\n","Headline":"\nRELEASE HEARTENS FOES OF SECRET EVIDENCE \n","Text":["\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ When the guards came to his cell on Monday night,\nhe held out his arms for the manacles as usual.\n","\n   But when he heard the whispered words ``Pack up'' and was led\nout of the Hudson County Correctional Center to the cold, empty\nstreet, Hany Kiareldeen realized that his long, dark odyssey\nthrough the immigration system was over.\n","\n   Kiareldeen, 31, a Palestinian immigrant, was released Monday\nnight after a 19-month sojourn in two New Jersey jails.
