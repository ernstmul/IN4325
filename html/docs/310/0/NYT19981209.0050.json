But\nsnug-fitting cotton pajamas, previously considered dangerous,\nshould be OK.\n\n   Until this year, the agency advised the public that\nflame-resistant pajamas were the only safe garments children should\nwear to bed. However, those standards were relaxed this year, after\nthe commission decided that the way pajamas fit is more important\nthan the fabric they're made of.\n\n   ``By fitting close to the skin, you don't have oxygen underneath\nthat feeds the fire,'' said Ken Giles, a commission spokesman.\n\n   Each year, up to 300 children are burned by being near a flame _\na space heater, kitchen range or candle, for example _ while\nwearing loose-fitting sleepers, the safety commission said. Hence\nthe warning about loose T-shirts.\n\n   Flame-resistant fabrics, such as polyester, stop burning when\nremoved from a flame, prompting the agency's earlier warning about\nfabric types. Cotton was one fabric the commission used to warn\nagainst, because it can burn rapidly. But Giles said that is not\nthe case if the cotton garment is tight.\n\n   Report says states not curbing animal pollution\n\n   WASHINGTON -- At least 30 states are failing to curb pollution\nfrom large livestock and poultry operations, a report says. The\nwaste from these ``animal factories'' fouls drinking water and\nthreatens public health, according to the Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, an environmental group that released the report last week.\n\n   ``Most states have few regulations and do little to enforce what\nlaws might be on the books,'' said Robbin Marks, one of the authors\nof the report. ``The result is unchecked pollution leading to\ncontaminated well water, fish kills, sickness from toxic gases in\nthe air and plummeting property values for neighboring\nlandowners.''\n\n   Livestock industry representatives say the report lacks\nscientific evidence and is packed with old information.\n\n   ``If this (the report) was food, it would have salmonella,''\nsaid Steve Cohen, spokesman for the National Pork Producers\nCouncil.\n\n   Environmental groups, however, say much more needs to be done.\nThe report details specific environmental problems in 30 states.\n\n   In North Carolina, for example, groundwater contamination near\nanimal factories is increasing, posing a potentially serious\ndrinking water problem for nearby residents, the report says.\n\n   Shock waves tested for orthopedic pain\n\n   Clinical trials are under way in five U.S. cities to determine\nif extracorporeal shock wave therapy can benefit those with foot\npain.\n\n   ``I'm not completely well; I've probably got about a third of\nthe pain left,'' says Rick Waits, 47, of Atlanta, whose foot pain\nkept him from playing golf or going for walks. ``But the beauty of\nit now is all I have to do is get off my feet for 15 or 30 minutes\nand I start to get relief. That was never the case before.''\n\n   The treatment that turned Waits' life around and healed his heel\ninvolves a machine called an OssaTron, which uses high-energy shock\nwaves to blast away calcifications and re-tear injured tendons in\nheel spurs and tennis elbows. By doing this, doctors can dissipate\nold scars and cause tendons to heal correctly, thus alleviating\npain.\n\n   The technique, called extracorporeal shock wave therapy, has\nbeen around since the mid-1980s, when it was first used to\ndisintegrate kidney stones. Researchers suspected that the process\nhad a number of orthopedic applications as well.\n\n   Mental health officials try to get a hold on `basket' restraint\nmisuse\n\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Unless national standards for training\nand the use of physical restraint are developed, state and national\nexperts believe more people like 17-year-old Laura Hanson will die.\n\n   Police are still investigating Hanson's death, which was ruled a\nhomicide by asphyxia. She died Nov. 19 after two employees put her\nin the controversial ``basket hold,'' a restraint that has lead to\nthe deaths of mental health patients across the country. The hold\nbecomes deadly when the patient is placed face-down, pressure is\nplaced on the backs and the patient's arms are criss-crossed over\nthe chest.\n\n   The Child Welfare League of America, the nation's oldest child\nadvocacy organization, is pushing for national standards regarding\nthe use of restraint, said Lloyd Bullard, director of residential\ncare for the Washington-based nonprofit agency. Bullard said the\ngroup wants federal legislation that will require training and\nmandatory reporting of restraint deaths.\n\n   It's head lice season again\n\n   The start of the school season means the return of head lice\nseason. If your kids come home with head lice, don't expect a quick\nsolution. Here are a few tips:\n\n   _ Use the lice-killing shampoo. While common over-the-counter\npediculicides are only 70 percent to 80 percent effective at\nkilling the eggs, that's the only way to start. Most contain\npyrethrum, a naturally occurring pesticide derived from\nchrysanthemum flowers. Lindane, the prescription pesticide used for\npubic lice, is considered somewhat toxic and should be used only as\na last resort.\n\n   _ Get a metal comb. Those plastic combs that come with\nlice-killing shampoo are practically useless at trapping nits. Give\nit to your daughter so she can disinfest Barbie's hair while you\nwork on hers with a sturdy metal comb, which costs about $5.\n\n   _ Get a few small plastic hair clips and a fine-tooth plastic\ncomb with a long handle. You can and will learn to part and repart\nthe kids' hair like a stylist cutting a shag.\n\n   _ Every night: Get the children sitting in position with water,\ntoys and treats. Comb their hair out with a regular comb. Check the\nscalp thoroughly for live and dead lice, pick them out and put them\nin a cup of water. Next, nits. Take a small ( 1/2-inch to 1-inch)\nbunch of hair, and scrape the nit-removal comb through it, making\nsure the shafts of hair push against the top of the comb. Check the\nhair carefully and pick out nits the comb misses; deposit in the\ncup of water. Repeat with the next bunch of hair.\n\n   _ Change kids' sheets and pillowcases every night for the first\nweek. Then change their pillowcases every night until the nits are\nhistory.\n\n   For more information, call the National Pediculosis Association\nat 1-800-446-4672 or visit the nonprofit agency's Web site:\nhttp://www.headlice.org.\n\n   Shelters, school lunch programs focusing on nutrition\n\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ Those who feed the poor, from the federal\ngovernment to local food pantries, are increasingly aware of the\nrole proper nutrition should play in their programs. Some say it is\npaying off in more healthful diets for low-income families.\n\n   ``My general observation is that . . . the nutritional quality\nof the foods that are currently coming through the system are some\nof the best I've seen in a very long time,'' said Lisa\nHamler-Podolski, director of the advocacy group Ohio Food Policy\nand Anti-Poverty Action Center.\n\n   The USDA also prepares its food differently. Where it once\npacked fruit in sugar solutions, it now uses natural juice. It\neliminated the use of tropical oils. It developed items such as\nlower-fat beef patties and cut the sodium content in cereals.\n\n   Government-backed public school lunches _ which low-income\nstudents can eat free or at a reduced cost _ have also gone\nwholesome.\n\n   In the Dayton schools, where 75 percent of students get free or\nreduced-price meals, cooks have slashed their dishes' fat and\nsodium levels, according to Nutrition Services Director Nancy\nWoods.\n\n   ``We haven't fried anything to speak of in years _ except french\nfries,'' she said. ``And we use olive oil to fry them.''\n\n   Florida bans online Viagra prescriptions\n\n   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Concerned about the danger of Web sites that\noffer Viagra prescriptions without any face-to-face doctor-patient\ncontact, the state's Board of Medicine said that doctors who\nprescribe the drug online could face criminal prosecution or board\ndiscipline.\n\n   ``We need to have at least a basic history and physical and an\nimpotence workup,'' said Dr. Abraham Woods, a urologist and member\nof the board. ``This is clearly not an issue you want to treat\nlightly.''\n\n   The area of Internet prescriptions is so new that the board had\nnever before discussed setting rules for the issue, but the board\nmade it clear that they frown upon online Viagra prescriptions.\n\n   The main problem, board members said, is that doctors who\nprescribe over the Internet know very little about the patient.\nWoods said some patients may be impotent as a result of diabetes or\nelevated testosterone levels, and therefore Viagra would not be\nappropriate.
