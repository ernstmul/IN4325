He was on\nthe team that set two landers on Mars in 1976.

Then, he won public backing for such hunts from\n70 of the world's top scientists, including seven Nobel laureates.\n\n   ``We urge the organization of a coordinated, worldwide, and\nsystematic search for extraterrestrial intelligence,'' Sagan's\ngroup wrote in Science, the nation's foremost scientific journal.\n\n   Part of his growing influence came from the great popularity of\nhis books, most of which were best sellers. ``The Dragons of Eden''\n(Random House, 1977) won a Pulitzer Prize. Others included\n``Broca's Brain'' (Random House, 1979) and ``Cosmos'' (Random\nHouse, 1980). ``Contact'' (Simon & Schuster, 1985), his only\nfictional work, told of a radio-telescope hunt that stumbled on an\nalien civilization.\n\n   Sagan became increasingly political in the 1980s. In books,\ntalks and protests, he faulted nuclear-arms testing, the Reagan\nadministration's Star Wars anti-missile plan and, inspired by a\ndust storm on Mars, warned that nuclear war could result in a\nsmoke-shrouded, deeply frozen Earth that he and colleagues called\n``nuclear winter.''\n\n   His leap from the ivory tower to television studios and\nexecutive suites annoyed some peers. Science magazine in 1982\nlooked askance at The Cosmos Store, a venture Sagan set up to make\ncosmic books and calendars. The National Academy of Sciences, the\nnation's premier scientific club, landed a heavy blow in 1992 by\nrejecting him for membership.\n\n   ``Carl was so superb at public relations that this engendered\nsome jealousy among colleagues who weren't,'' said Elliott\nLevinthal, a Stanford professor who worked with Sagan for many\nyears.\n\n   Despite the academy rebuff, he grew even more powerful. Starting\nin 1992, Goldin, the newly installed NASA administrator, a former\naerospace engineer and executive, consulted Sagan for advice and\ndeveloped a respect for his energy and views during dozens of\nmeetings.\n\n   The bond was strengthened by personal history.

Sagan,\nhe said, especially bore in on how to probe Mars, whose greater\nwarmth and wetness in its early days were seen as possibly having\ngiven rise to microbes or other forms of life.\n\n   Historically, NASA had taken a Cadillac approach to space\nexploration, launching costly probes rarely. The more costly the\nprobes got, the rarer and more complex they became. In 1992, only\none spacecraft was scheduled to fly to Mars, a $1 billion orbiter\nknown as Observer, the nation's first mission to the red planet in\n17 years.\n\n   ``His argument was that this is not a program, it's a single\nevent, it's the last ship out of port,'' Goldin recalled.\n``Although I had a lot of my own thoughts, and had talked to a lot\nof people, Carl convinced me I had to develop a vision and a\nstrategy for Mars.'' By early 1993, Goldin said, a new plan was\nset. It featured low-cost orbiters and landers to be flown every\ntwo years as Mars and Earth came into alignment. The merit of the\nnew approach was driven home in August 1993 when the costly\nObserver craft, as it neared the red planet, failed mysteriously.\n\n   The new series began last year when Mars Pathfinder landed and\ncreated a sensation with its miniature rover.
