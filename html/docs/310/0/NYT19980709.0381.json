Times News Service   \n\n   MINNEAPOLIS _ It is odd to find the Museum of Questionable\nMedical Devices here in the capital of Midwestern niceness.\n\n   But just across the river from all the skyscrapers, in the\nhistoric St. Anthony Main complex, is an array of bogus medical\ndevices spanning two centuries, a stunning testament to the myriad\nways people have tried to make money off the eternal ills of\nhumankind.\n\n   Baldness, impotence and obesity seem to inspire the most\ncreations, including slimming soaps, ``sanitized tapeworms'' and a\nremarkable hair-loss device _ the Crosly Xervac _ that creates a\nvacuum to pull blood to the scalp and no doubt caused more hickeys\nthan hair growth.\n\n   For more general health benefits, there were contraptions like\nthe MacGregor Rejuvenator, dating from 1932, a magenta\niron-lung-like machine in which a patient would lie, to be blasted\nwith magnetism, radio waves and infrared and ultraviolet light, in\nhopes of reversing the aging process.\n\n   The museum of quackery is tiny, out of the way, open mostly in\nthe evenings and is free. After 14 years, it is taking off.\n\n   ``We're seeing 750 people a week now,'' said Robert W.

Especially about sex.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Pre-Viagra, attempts to restore ``sexual vitality'' involved\nitems like a 1918 prostate gland warmer, which was plugged into a\nsocket, then inserted into the rectum, or the Manhood Belt of the\nsame era, which created a burning sensation when activated by body\nsweat because it was soaked in red pepper.\n\n   In the 1920s, those seeking an aphrodisiac might have turned to\nRadithor, a concoction of distilled water laced with radium.\nRadioactivity became the miracle cure for all kinds of things,\noffered in suppository form for women, or in a jock strap for men.\n``Weak Discouraged Men!'' trumpets one circular. ``Now Bubble Over\nwith Joyous Vitality Through the Use of GLANDS and RADIUM.''\n\n   The museum also has an old fluoroscope, an X-ray machine used in\nthe 1950s to fit shoes: children would stick their feet in, then\nlook through the machine to see their green toe bones wriggling\naround inside the shoe. McCoy's relic turned up in a West Virginia\ndepartment store in 1981, long after its use was generally banned.\n\n   Some of the museum's displays were late-night television fodder,\nlike the foot-operated bosom enlarger, a pump with pink cups to be\nplaced over the breast.
