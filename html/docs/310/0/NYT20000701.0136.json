I'm dead and my\nchildren are dead.' He only missed us by a couple inches,'' Owens\nsaid.\n\n   ``When I got where I was going in Tipp City, I was still shaking\nall over.''\n\n   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association estimates\nthere are about 94 million Americans with wireless telephones right\nnow, and another 46,000 people sign up for new mobile phone service\nevery day.\n\n   Naturally, within a pool that large, there will be a few jerks\nlike the guy in the dark blue Mercedes.\n\n   Bob Schafer said he recently had a head-on encounter with a car\ndriven by a young woman who laughed and talked merrily on her phone\nas she exited Interstate 70 using the entrance ramp from Ohio 48.\nShe apparently never realized her mistake even after Schafer\nscreeched to a halt and blared his horn at her.\n\n   Don McGee said he recently saw what appeared to be a businessman\nin a shiny black sport utility vehicle turn left with the thumb and\nindex finger of his left hand holding a sheet of paper against the\nsteering wheel while using his other hand to hold a phone to his\near.\n\n   ``I'm sure he thought he was\nproductive/efficient/chic/connected/cool,'' McGee said. `` . . .\nbut, to those of us who watched him make that turn, he will always\nbe just a self-absorbed moron.''\n\n   Driving while talking on a mobile phone is illegal in England,\nIsrael and a few other countries. The Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn\nlast year became the first American city to start ticketing\nmotorists for using a handheld phone while driving, and other\ncities have followed suit.\n\n   State legislatures across the country have debated the issue,\nbut none have banned mobile phone use in cars.\n\n   The New England Journal of Medicine published a study in 1997\nthat said a driver using a cell phone was four times more likely to\nbe in an accident than drivers who were not talking.\n\n   And the study indicated that phones that a driver could use with\nboth hands free were no less dangerous than phones that had to be\nheld. Apparently it's the distraction of holding a conversation\nwhile driving and not the problem of having one hand occupied that\ncauses problems.\n\n   Lisa Keller is a waitress at a restaurant that serves breakfast\nand she said, ``People get so wrapped up in their cell phone\nconversation, they don't even realize you're standing in front of\nthem trying to take their orders.''\n\n   Keller said she had her worst restaurant mobile phone experience\nas a customer at a restaurant three years ago. ``There weren't many\npeople there, but there was one guy talking on his cell phone like\nhe was the only person in the building,'' she said. ``We had to ask\nto move to a different table further away from him.\n\n   ``What's really sad is when the business you're in makes you so\nbusy that you can't even interact with the people around you.''\n\n   David Hume, owner of the Pine Club in Dayton, said his staff has\nhad to quiet people who were disturbing others at his restaurant\nwith their mobile phones, but it happens rarely. Hume said he\npersonally is known for using his cell phone frequently while\nrunning his business, and he understands the need for some people\nto stay in touch.\n\n   ``If somebody has a phone that rang loudly or he was talking,\nwe're really tuned into that sort of thing, and we would talk to\nhim about it,'' Hume said.\n\n   ``But really the bigger issue is common courtesy. Some people\nhave cell phones that instead of ringing they play Beethoven's\n``Fifth Symphony'' or something. Having that go off in a restaurant\nis inappropriate and unnecessary.\n\n   ``But by the same token, if somebody is at a table using loud,\naggressive language that, too, is inappropriate.''\n\n   TALKING TASTEFULLY\n\n   ``Cell phones in restaurants are rude,'' said Sue Fox, an author\nand consultant on business etiquette.\n\n   ``The essence of courtesy is making people feel comfortable, and\nwhen you're sitting at a table talking on the phone, you're putting\neverybody around you in an awkward position,'' Fox said.\n\n   Fox said she worked for Apple Computers for more than 10 years\nand says she got firsthand exposure to every business etiquette\nmistake possible. She still works in Silicon Valley, but now she\nruns Etiquette Survival Inc. in Los Gatos, Calif., and conducts\nseminars in business etiquette and international protocol.\n\n   She said mobile phone use became a status symbol years ago in\nSouthern California, and restaurants and other public businesses\nhave had to ban mobile phone use to curb inconsiderate behavior.\n\n   Fox said mobile phones, e-mail and other technologies became\npopular so quickly that there wasn't time for rules of etiquette to\nbe established for their use. But she said common sense and\nconsideration for others dictate how wireless phones should be\nused.\n\n   Here are some courtesy rules for mobile phone use:\n\n   _ Don't take a mobile phone to dinner with you if you can avoid\nit. If you are a doctor or someone else who must be reachable in an\nemergency, use a phone that vibrates instead of ringing.\n\n   _ If you are expecting a call that can't be postponed until\nafter dinner, tell your dining companions ahead of time. When the\ncall comes in, excuse yourself and answer the call in a place where\nyou will have some privacy. ``You can't help but overhear if\nsomeone nearby is talking on a cell phone,'' Fox said. ``Remember\nthat nobody wants to hear your conversation, so talk where no one\nwill be forced to listen.''\n\n   _ If you know you're going to have to be on the phone a lot,\nstay at home. It's unfair to others to interrupt a meal, a meeting,\na sermon or other public event with constant phone calls.\n\n   _ If you receive a call while driving, pull off the road if you\nhave to answer it. If you have to initiate a call while driving,\npark first.\n\n   _ Never talk on a mobile phone while in a social setting with\nothers. You put your companions in the awkward position of not\nbeing able to talk freely among themselves for fear of disturbing\nyou. If you're dining with only one other person, that person has\nno one to talk to at all while you're on the phone.\n\n   _ Keep your voice down. Occasionally you may be forced to take\nan emergency call in a public place such as in a store. Move to a\nsecluded area if possible and talk quietly. Under no circumstances\nshould you shout, curse or otherwise display anger during a public\nphone call. Save your histrionics for a time when you have privacy\nand won't embarrass or offend others.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ruby Owens has a bumper sticker that says ``If we\nwere meant to be talking on the phone while driving, we'd be\ndriving phone booths.''\n","\n   Owens is one of the growing horde of people who have had\nunpleasant encounters with people who have turned on their mobile\nphones and clicked off their brains.\n","\n   In her case it was a guy in a dark blue Mercedes ``with a\nBudweiser in one hand and a cell phone in the other, driving with\nhis knees'' on northbound Interstate 75 approaching a dangerous\ninterchange.\n","\n   Owens said the man was carrying on a lively conversation as he\nswerved from side to side, nearly forcing her and her van full of\nchildren off the road. ``I was saying 'Oh my God!
