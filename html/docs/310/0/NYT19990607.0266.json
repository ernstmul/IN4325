Snyder envisions a new approach to many brain\ndiseases, based on the use of neural stem cells. ``It's very\nconceivable that within this decade we will have a genuine\ncontribution to make to brain repair,'' he said.\n\n   Snyder's optimism is shared by other biologists who work on stem\ncells, both in the brain and other organs, and who see themselves\nas opening up a new field of medicine based on the body's own\nrepair system. The use of stem cells, together with the signals\nthat control the cells' behavior, is sometimes known as\nregenerative medicine.\n\n   ``We do believe this represents a paradigm shift, that it's a\nwhole new way of repairing the brain by trying to invoke\nfundamental principles of brain development,'' Snyder said.\n\n   Dr. Ron McKay, a neural stem cell expert at the National\nInstitutes of Health, said Snyder's experiment was ``pretty\nimpressive'' in showing how much of the shiverer mouse brains could\nbe re-sheathed in myelin.
