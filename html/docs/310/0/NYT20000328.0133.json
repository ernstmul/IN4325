In a responding burst of\nelectronic information, the base station assigns a ``channel'' to\nthe phone on which to conduct a conversation.\n\n   The MTSO then assigns the cell-phone caller a voice frequency or\nchannel to use during a particular conversation. This all takes\nplace in a fraction of a second.\n\n   The MTSO is able to determine whether the call is being made to\nanother cell phone user or to a person using a conventional phone.\nIf the call is being made to a conventional phone, the MTSO routes\nthe call into the local telephone network which then takes over the\ncall.\n\n   If the call is being made to another cell phone user, the MTSO\ncontacts the other cell phone using microwave signals. The signal\nis sent to a series of base stations (and perhaps even a satellite\nif the call is long-distance) and then is picked up by the\nreceiving cell phone.\n\n   During the phone call the MTSO's computer is constantly\nmonitoring the strength of the voice signal. If the signal drops\ntoo low, the MTSO will send the call to a new base station or cell.\nThe sizes of a cell varies, ranging from two to 10 square miles. A\nperson using a cell phone in a car may travel through a series of\ncells.\n\n   It's estimated that there are more than 100,000 base station\nantennas in the United States.
