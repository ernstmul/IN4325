Times News Service    \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's agreement on how to conduct the\ninitial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial sent House\nprosecutors and the president's lawyers diving this weekend back\ninto the voluminous evidence collected by Kenneth Starr, the\nindependent counsel.\n\n   In the 7,000 pages of grand jury testimony and boxes of\nsupplementary evidence, Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House\nprosecution team, sees a clear and convincing picture of perjury\nand obstruction of justice so grave that Clinton should be removed\nfrom office.\n\n   From that same pile of evidence, the president's legal team is\nputting together a more aggressive defense than the one they\npresented unsuccessfully to the House _ one they now say should\nlead to the president's acquittal. The White House agreed to accept\nthe record of testimony amassed by the independent counsel,\nalthough the president's lawyers profoundly disagree with Starr and\nHyde about what the evidence shows.\n\n   The president's lawyers will argue that instead of proving that\nClinton lied or obstructed justice, the evidence shows only that\nClinton tried to conceal the embarrassing details of an improper\nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky, according to interviews and\nlegal documents they have prepared for the Senate trial. Though the\npresident's actions and behavior were ``reprehensible,'' Charles\nRuff, the White House counsel, has said, they were not unlawful.\n\n   The Senate's Republicans and Democrats spent this week sparring\nover whether to call witnesses, virtually all of whom have already\ntestified under oath before Starr's grand jury. On Friday, the\nsenators agreed to defer until late January a decision on whether\nto summon witnesses _ and if so, which ones.\n\n   That decision will dramatically affect the length and tenor of\nthe trial. And perhaps more important, both the president's\nprosecutors and his defenders can point to many of the same\nwitnesses and testimony as buttressing their respective cases.\n\n   The impeachment proceedings in the House involved legal jousting\nover the constitutional standards for high crimes and misdemeanors.\nAlthough those arguments will be heard again in the Senate, the\nHouse prosecutors and White House lawyers are preparing to lock\nhorns directly on the factual details of the case. In those\ndetails, each side sees a starkly different picture.\n\n   For example, the prosecution team wants to call Betty Currie,\nthe president's secretary, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a Washington\nlawyer and presidential confidant, to question them, respectively,\nabout gifts and job help Ms. Lewinsky received from the president.\n\n   Central to the impeachment article charging the president with\nobstruction of justice are accusations that Clinton schemed with\nMs. Lewinsky to hide gifts sought in the Paula Jones lawsuit\nagainst the president, and that efforts by Jordan to help Ms.\nLewinsky find a job were intended to buy her silence in the Jones\ncase.\n\n   But the testimony of Ms. Currie and Jordan before the grand jury\nalso forms the cornerstone of Clinton's defense against\nobstruction. Ms. Currie testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who\nasked her to retrieve the gifts, and Jordan said there was no quid\npro quo between his help in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job and her\naffidavit in the Jones case denying a sexual relationship with the\npresident.\n\n   The testimony of Ms. Lewinsky also cuts both ways. She testified\nthat the president engaged in sexual activity with her that fell\nwithin the narrow definition of sexual relations in the Jones case.\n\n   That pits her word against the president's denial before the\ngrand jury on Aug. 17 that he had lied in his civil deposition in\nthe Jones case. In the Jones deposition, he said he had not engaged\nin sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. The president's insistence\nthat his testimony in the Jones case was not perjurious is another\ncharge outlined in the impeachment article.\n\n   But Ms. Lewinsky also testified that no one asked her to lie and\nthat she was not offered help finding a job to secure her silence\nin the Jones case. That testimony undercuts the heart of the\nobstruction of justice case against the president.\n\n   Whether or not witnesses are called, the prosecution and the\ndefense will highlight selected portions of the testimony of\ncrucial figures like Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie and Jordan for their\nown purposes.\n\n   That is all the more certain given that much of the case against\nthe president is circumstantial and turns on subjective views of\nhis intentions and interactions with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie,\nJordan, other White House aides and his lawyers.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Perhaps the most difficult charges for the president to rebut\nare contained in the article of impeachment charging him with lying\nbefore the grand jury about the nature and details of his\nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky testified in detail\nabout 11 sexual encounters with the president. That testimony is\nperhaps the most problematic evidence confronting the president's\nlawyers.\n\n   Because Clinton told the grand jury that he did not have sexual\nrelations with Ms. Lewinsky as defined in the Jones case, the\nevidence on this point boils down to his word against hers.\n\n   The president's legal team must decide whether to try to\nundermine Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with other evidence. Among\nthat evidence is the testimony of witnesses and friends of Ms.\nLewinsky's who said that Ms. Lewinsky told them things that may\nhave been untrue, like the Secret Service took the president to Ms.\nLewinsky's apartment.\n\n   Of course, if the president's lawyers paint Ms. Lewinsky as a\nliar, their ability to use her testimony to support other aspects\nof their case, particularly on obstruction of justice, could be\nhindered.\n\n   The prosecution team will try to broaden its perjury case by\ncharging that the president lied about other details, like when his\nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky began, the frequency of their\nmeetings and the number of times they had sexually explicit\ntelephone conversations.\n\n   The president's legal team will emphasize that Clinton admitted\nto an ``inappropriate, intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky\nbefore the grand jury. They will argue that differences between the\npresident's and Ms. Lewinsky's descriptions of the number and\nspecific details of their sexual encounters are not significant\nenough to support a perjury charge.\n\n   Additionally, the president has testified that he thought the\nsexual activity in which he engaged with Ms. Lewinsky fell outside\nthe definition of sexual relations in the Jones case. However, this\nargument has provoked criticisms that the president and his lawyers\nare engaged in tortured legal hair-splitting.\n\n   The perjury article of impeachment also charges the president\nwith lying when he told the grand jury that he did not lie in the\nJones case and with letting his lawyer in the Jones case, Robert S.\nBennett, falsely deny that the president and Ms. Lewinsky were\nsexually involved. It also accuses the president of lying to his\naides about his dealings with Ms. Lewinsky. The charges involving\nBennett and the aides are repackaged in the second article of\nimpeachment involving obstruction of justice, as well.\n\n   The president's legal team thinks these allegations are more\neasily rebutted. They will argue that he thought he was being\ntechnically truthful, even if he was misleading, during the Jones\ndeposition. Hardly intending to lie to his aides in order to\ninfluence their future testimony, the president's defenders will\nexplain, he was trying to conceal from his friends and family an\nimproper relationship about which he was deeply embarrassed.\n\n   The article of impeachment charging obstruction of justice turns\non the belief of both Starr and the House prosecutors that the\npresident wanted Ms. Lewinsky to testify falsely in the Jones case\nand that he also sought to influence other potential witnesses,\nlike Ms. Currie, his aides and his lawyer, Bennett, to give false\naccounts of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In return for her\nfalse testimony, Ms. Lewinsky was to be rewarded with help finding\na job.\n\n   In the perjury case, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is at odds with\ncrucial aspects of the president's account. In the obstruction\ncase, the prosecutors must make a circumstantial but highly\nsuggestive set of facts support a sweeping accusation. None of the\nwitnesses involved in the events, including Ms. Lewinsky, Ms.\nCurrie and Jordan, has testified that the president asked them to\nlie, schemed to hide evidence or tried to enlist help to keep Ms.\nLewinsky quiet.\n\n   In both the Starr referral and the final House impeachment\nreport, great weight is given to gifts that the President gave Ms.\nLewinsky that she later turned over to Ms. Currie. The gifts were\nsubpoenaed by the Jones lawyers.\n\n   The House Judiciary Committee concluded that Ms. Currie would\nnot have retrieved the gifts unless asked to do so by the\npresident.\n\n   However, Ms. Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to\ncollect the gifts, and the president has denied asking Ms. Currie\nto retrieve them.\n\n   According to an analysis of her testimony by the president's\nlawyers, Ms. Lewinsky has given 10 different accounts of her\nconversations with the president about the gifts. In none of those\nconversations, they will argue, did the president instruct Ms.\nLewinsky to conceal the gifts.\n\n   Ms. Currie also testified that she felt no pressure or\nintimidation from the president, who is accused of trying to\ninfluence her testimony, and she was not a witness in any\nproceeding when the president talked to her about Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nTRIAL ACCORD SHIFTS FOCUS BACK TO STARR'S EVIDENCE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's agreement on how to conduct the\ninitial phase of President Clinton's impeachment trial sent House\nprosecutors and the president's lawyers diving this weekend back\ninto the voluminous evidence collected by Kenneth Starr, the\nindependent counsel.\n","\n   In the 7,000 pages of grand jury testimony and boxes of\nsupplementary evidence, Rep.
