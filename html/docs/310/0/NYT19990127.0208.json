Times News Service   \n\n   (italics)Cordless phones act as small radios, sending signals\nbetween the handset and the receiver. For many years, cordless\nphones operated on frequencies around 49 megahertz in the radio\nspectrum. When that part of the spectrum grew crowded,\nmanufacturers began making phones that send signals at 900 MHz, a\nless congested frequency. Cordless phones can also be analog or\ndigital. The difference isn't in what part of the radio spectrum\nthey use _ it is in how the sound information is packaged for\ntransmission. Here are the cordless options:(end italics)   \n  \n\n   ANALOG Analog cordless phones are what most people have at home;\nthey are the most basic and least expensive cordless phones on the\nmarket. Most operate around 49 MHz, but 900-MHz analog phones are\ngaining. Prices are dropping steeply. You can buy a 900-MHz analog\ncordless phone for as little as $30.\n\n   Analog phones translate sound waves into radio waves and back\nagain, which does not require computer chips. But they are\nsusceptible to electronic interference and eavesdropping from radio\nscanners.\n\n   But if you intend to use your phone 100 to 200 feet away from\nthe base and security is not a big concern, then a 49-MHz analog\nphone should be fine, said Eldon Chuck, a product manager at\nThomson Consumer Electronics.   \n  \n\n   DIGITAL Digital cordless phones convert the sound going to and\nfrom the handset into a stream of digital signals; they are\nreconverted into analog signals before they are sent down the phone\nline. The additional circuitry makes digital phones more expensive.\nBut they are more secure than analog phones. Digital cordless\nphones, which operate at 900 MHz, are not very popular because they\ncost more than analog phones but offer few advantages.   \n  \n\n   DIGITAL SPREAD-SPECTRUM These phones are another matter entirely\n_ and the most expensive cordless phones on the market. If privacy\nor long range is important to you, you should consider buying a\n900-MHz digital spread-spectrum phone. Digital spread-spectrum\nphones provide extra security because once the sound information is\nconverted into digital signals, the signals are sent over a wide\nrange of frequencies and jump from one frequency to another, making\neavesdropping virtually impossible.\n\n   A spread-spectrum phone can cost as little as $79, but the\naverage price is closer to $100. The new 2.4-gigahertz phones are\nall spread spectrum. Spread-spectrum phones are best for people who\nlive in cities. The phone's added power expands its range.  \n","Headline":"\nPHONE TERMS EXPLAINED \n","Text":["\n   (italics)Cordless phones act as small radios, sending signals\nbetween the handset and the receiver.
