(The Week in Review)  \n(jt) \n By ERICA GOODE    \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  \n\n   Medical science, focused on curing the ills of the body, has\noften treated the mind like an annoying younger brother: a presence\nto be ignored whenever possible, humored when unavoidable and used\nas a scapegoat when the need arises.\n\n   What modern medicine, until recently, has not done, in any\nsystematic fashion, is to view mental and physical process as\ninextricably entwined. Though most paid homage to the importance of\ntreating the ``whole patient,'' medical scientists by and large\nhave remained faithful to Descartes' conception of mind-body\ndualism, dutifully dividing the psychiatric from the physical. They\naccepted that patients often respond emotionally to physical\ndisease. But doctors have largely disdained the possibility that\nemotional state _ be it anxiety, anger or optimism _ might itself\nalter the course of a physical illness, or that treating\npsychological distress might improve physical health.\n\n   Recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that to take\na strictly Cartesian view is problematic. For one thing, such a\nview does not make room for the growing number of studies appearing\nin mainstream medical journals that demonstrate the impact of\npsychology on physiology. Most recently, researchers reported last\nweek in the Journal of the American Medical Association that\nwriting about traumatic experiences measurably improved the health\nof some patients with chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n   Of 70 patients in the study who spent 20 minutes on each of\nthree consecutive days writing about ``the most stressful\nexperience they had ever undergone,'' 47.1 percent showed\nsignificant improvement on objective measures of disease severity\nfour months later, compared to 24.3 percent who improved in a\ncontrol group. The findings will have to be replicated by other\nresearchers, and many questions were left unanswered: How could a\nsimple writing exercise have such a substantial impact on patients'\nhealth four months later? What factors make it more likely that an\nindividual patient will benefit from such a treatment?\n\n   Yet it is difficult not to conclude, as Dr. David Spiegel,\nassociate chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at\nStanford University, did in an editorial accompanying the study,\nthat ``the authors have provided evidence that medical treatment is\nmore effective when standard pharmacological intervention is\ncombined with the management of emotional distress.'' In this study\nand others, he noted, ``it is not simply mind over matter, but it\nis clear that mind matters.''\n\n   In a 1989 article in the British journal Lancet Spiegel and his\ncolleagues reported longer survival rates for breast cancer\nsurvivors who took part in support groups emphasizing emotional\nexpression and active coping skills. Other researchers have\nreported comparable findings for melanoma and lymphoma patients,\nthough three studies failed to find that psychosocial support\nlengthened survival for cancer patients. A 1988 study by a team led\nby Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn found that meditation, a stress-reduction\ntechnique, increased rates of improvement in psoriasis patients who\nwere also receiving standard medical treatment.\n\n   Equally intriguing are studies that tackle the mind-body\nequation by finding links between severe stress and illnesses. A\nlarge study published last year found that people who suffered\nabuse in childhood, had a parent who was alcoholic, an addict or a\nbattered woman, or endured other stressful situations, were two to\nfour times more likely to suffer serious illnesses like heart\ndisease, emphysema, and stroke than other adults. The frequency of\ndisorders, the researchers reported, increased with the number of\n``adverse childhood experiences'' a person had been exposed to.\n\n   Other scientists have found that veterans with post-traumatic\nstress disorder also were more likely to suffer from a variety of\nsevere maladies, including heart disease and diseases of the\nrespiratory, digestive and musculoskeletal system than were\nveterans without the stress disorder. An artificial division\nbetween conditions that belong to ``psychiatry'' and those that\nbelong to ``medicine'' is ``nonsense,'' said Dr. Matthew Friedman,\nexecutive director of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, ``because stress is something that happens to the brain.\nIt's not something in the ether that happens to the mind. Stress is\nvery real. It has lots of medical effects. It also has\npsychological effects.''\n\n   Neuroscientists, who are slowly unraveling the complex\ninterrelationship of genetics, chemistry and cellular function in\nthe brain, seem considerably more comfortable jettisoning the\ndualism of Descartes than many clinicians in routine medical\nspecialities. With the help of new tools, including PET and MRI\nscanning, gene knockouts and other technologies, they are revealing\nthe brain as much more plastic than was once thought. Brain\nchemistry and structure, studies have shown, may be altered by\n``psychological'' experiences, including learning and stress.\n\n   The result is a much more integrated view of human functioning.\n``We now realize that the brain is a lot more involved in governing\nmany different functions in the body,'' says Dr. Bruce McEwen,\ndirector of the laboratory of endocrinology at Rockefeller\nUniversity and an expert on stress. ``Appetite, sleep, food intake,\nemotions, health-promoting and self-destructive behaviors _ all\nthese things are both controlled by and in turn influence the\nbrain.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.

Just as blood\npressure and heart rate adjust when a person moves from a lying to\na standing position, the body's approach to stress is\n``allostatic.'' That is, it strives to preserve stability through\nchange, making adjustments in regulatory systems _ heart rate,\nhormone levels, metabolism, immune system _ in response to both the\nexternal and internal environment.\n\n   How strong and how long-lasting a person's response to stress is\ndepends on a variety of factors, including genetics, overall health\nand how the person perceives the stress. And stress can be helpful\nas well as harmful: Acute stress can enhance immune responses. But\nMcEwen and his colleagues have demonstrated that if stress\naccumulates over weeks or months, the body's stress system can\nbecome stuck in a partially ``on'' mode, causing damage and\ndisrupting normal responses. Prolonged stress, the work of McEwen\nand other researchers has shown, can permanently damage nerve cells\nin an area of the brain called the hippocampus, lead to\nabnormalities in glucose metabolism and immune function, and are\nassociated with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n   If scientists are discovering such strong evidence of\nreciprocity between body and mind, why is there still resistance?\nThe answer has as much to do with sociology and politics as it does\nwith knowledge. While the public seems to have softened its\ndualistic view _ Americans made 629 million visits to alternative\nmedicine practitioners in 1997, more visits than to all primary\ncare physicians _ many doctors remain distrustful of treatments\nthat purport to achieve physical results through psychological\nmeans.\n\n   In many cases, caution is appropriate.

Nor is there\nany science to support the assertion that psychological techniques\ncan cure, as opposed to modifying a person's response to, illness.\n``If someone tells you that you can cure your cancer by imaging it\nin your head, don't believe them,'' Spiegel said, ``but if they\ntell you that it might help you cope with the disease once you've\ngot it, and that it might have some effect on disease course, as\nwell as quality of life, that might well be true.''\n\n   Similarly, Dr. Joshua Smyth, lead author of last week's asthma\nand rheumatoid arthritis study, cautioned that, ``The worst\npossible thing would be if people heard about this study and\nconcluded that if they keep a journal their asthma will go away.''\n\n   Still, some adjustments to Descartes' wall seem inevitable.
