Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ A newly declassified court document shows the FBI\nargued against freeing an Egyptian man who has been jailed for more\nthan three years on secret evidence because it would improve his\ncredibility among Arabs and people ``would be more inclined to\nlisten to him.''\n\n   The man, Nasser K. Ahmed, has been detained since April 1996\nwhile the government has tried to build a case that he had links to\nterrorist organizations. In an July 30 opinion, an immigration\njudge rejected the FBI's contention that Ahmed was a threat to\nnational security and ordered his release.\n\n   In a response included in a classified appendix to the opinion\nthat was released Wednesday, the bureau argued that Ahmed should\ncontinue to be detained not only because of the secret evidence\nagainst him but also because agents believed he would, if freed,\nbecome even more influential among Arabs because of his lengthy\nimprisonment.\n\n   ``His prominence in the community will increase if he is\nreleased,'' an unnamed FBI agent who gave secret testimony against\nAhmed told the judge. ``He would be more well known, lending to his\ncredibility in the community, both inside the United States and\noutside the United States.''\n\n   Arab-American groups and civil libertarians have sharply\ncriticized the use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings\nand have held up Ahmed's lengthy detention as an example of the\nunfairness of the practice.\n\n   In a similar case, a Palestinian native, Hany Kiareldeen, who\nwas also being held on secret evidence accusing him of terrorism,\nwas released from a New Jersey jail last month after being detained\nfor 19 months while the authorities tried to deport him.\n\n   ``What they did was wrong,'' said Ahmed, 39, speaking by phone\nfrom the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where\nhe remains while the government appeals his release. Ahmed said the\nrevelation that the FBI opposed his release, fearing in part that\nhis influence would grow because of his imprisonment, did not\nsurprise him.\n\n   ``At the beginning, it was I'm a terrorist threat,'' he said.\n``That doesn't exist anymore. So now it's, `He's going to be\ncredible, and he's going to be a risk.' They know from Day 1 that\nI'm innocent of any allegation that they claim.''\n\n   In the July 30 opinion in Ahmed's case, the immigration judge,\nDonn Livingston, criticized the use of secret evidence by the\ngovernment. The judge could not reveal the evidence or his analysis\nof it until the 16-page addendum was partly declassified a few days\nago by the Justice Department.\n\n   One of Ahmed's lawyers, Louis M. Bograd, a staff lawyer with the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said the document\nshowed ``just how lame and weak'' the secret evidence was and how\nprejudicial it had been for Ahmed's case.\n\n   Russell A. Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, said the agency did not discuss\n``particulars of cases still pending before the court.'' He said it\nwould also be inappropriate to comment on evidence developed by the\nFBI. A bureau spokesman, Joseph A. Valiquette, had no comment. The\ndocument was not completely declassified, so it was not possible to\nsee the full extent of the government's secret evidence and the\njudge's analysis of it.\n\n   In the declassified part, however, Livingston says that much of\nthe secret evidence was difficult to evaluate because it was\n``double or triple hearsay.'' He also questions the reliability of\nsome government sources and cites the description of one source as\n``a friendly foreign intelligence service.''\n\n   ``A very real concern of this court,'' the judge said, is\nwhether Egypt was the source of secret evidence against Ahmed, who\nhad worked as an aide to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a strong critic\nof the Egyptian government, during Abdel Rahman's 1995 trial in the\nplot to blow up landmarks in New York City.\n\n   Livingston cited ``the very real danger that the Egyptian\ngovernment may seek to silence Sheik Rahman by persecuting'' Ahmed,\nwho has been seeking political asylum in the United States.\n\n   The judge rejected other evidence suggesting Ahmed was linked to\nterrorist activities and said his links to Abdel Rahman were not\nevidence that he was a threat to national security.\n","Headline":"\nFBI FEARED PRISONER WOULD HAVE INCREASED INFLUENCE WITH ARABS\n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ A newly declassified court document shows the FBI\nargued against freeing an Egyptian man who has been jailed for more\nthan three years on secret evidence because it would improve his\ncredibility among Arabs and people ``would be more inclined to\nlisten to him.''\n","\n   The man, Nasser K.
