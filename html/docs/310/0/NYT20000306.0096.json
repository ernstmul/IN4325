Now\nconstruction crews are nearing completion of a colossal new one\npacked with high-tech improvements. It could let astronomers\nexamine uncharted reaches of the universe, and perhaps alter our\nconceptions of time and space and creation.\n\n   The new Green Bank Telescope (GBT) will be ``the largest dynamic\nstructure on Earth,'' said McKinnon. The only bigger machines are\naircraft carriers and similar-sized ocean vessels.\n\n   The project has taken more than a decade. It began shortly after\nthe collapse of Green Bank's 26-year-old radio telescope in late\n1988. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., famous for looking after the home\nfolks, quickly convinced Congress to appropriate $75 million to\nbegin building a much bigger replacement.\n\n   After considerable complications and delay, the new GBT _\nweighing 16 million pounds and standing as tall as the Washington\nMonument _ is to be completed this summer.\n\n   Having watched the telescope take shape like a monstrous\nroller-coaster, its neighbors are curious about what it will find,\nand thankful for the dollars that its construction brought into a\nhardscrabble community.\n\n   The region was initially chosen for an observatory because of\n``its lack of potential for economic development,'' said McKinnon.\n\n   Pocahontas County is about 100 miles long and 50 miles wide, but\nonly about 8,000 people live there. On the winding mountain roads,\nsome school buses take two hours to reach the high school in\nMarlinton, the county seat. The Monogahela National Forest covers\nmuch of the area.\n\n   Steady paychecks are hard to come by. The observatory employs\n110 people. Other residents are farmers or loggers. There is mostly\nseasonal work at the Snowshoe Ski Resort on the far side of Little\nMountain.\n\n   ``You have to string together several jobs to make a living,''\nsaid Tony Samons, who works as the Green Bank barber and a finish\ncarpenter and preaches to a congregation of about 40 souls at the\nChurch of God.\n\n   ``There are three sets of people here,'' allowed Samons, who\ncharges $4 for a haircut. ``First there are the natives. To be a\nnative, your grandpa had to be born here.''\n\n   Samons, who was born in Kentucky and moved here in 1979, puts\nhimself and many of the observatory people into a second group:\nlong-time residents who have reared families hereabouts, are\nacquainted with everybody, but aren't ``natives.''\n\n   The third group is made up of ``real outsiders'' such as\ntransient construction workers or visiting hunters, he said. ``The\nnatives call them pilgrims.''\n\n   It's a stubbornly insular place, where folks mind their own\nbusiness.\n\n   ``There are still a few people around who would sell you\nmoonshine if you wanted it,'' said Samons. ``But more grow\nmarijuana. They plant it in the national forest or between rows in\ncornfields.''\n\n   On Sundays, Green Bank's churchgoers have a choice of the\nLiberty Presbyterian, Wesley Chapel United Methodist, Hebron\nBaptist or the Church of God. Wares at the Green Bank General Store\nrange from hand-sewn quilts to crossbows. A homemade ice cream\nsandwich costs 69 cents, a double-edged ax goes for $45 and a used\nmandolin will set you back $145. For a fee, the Mountain State Meat\nMarket will turn a hunter's venison into sausage, jerky or cured\ndeer ham.\n\n   Green Bank has a clinic, a public library, an elementary school,\na post office, a hardware store, a volunteer fire department and\nrescue squad, a bank, an Oldsmobile dealer, an antique store, a\none-chair barber shop and a combination convenience store, gas\nstation and pizza parlor.\n\n   And now it has a new, world-class GBT _ which stands for ``Great\nBig Telescope,'' according to local humorists.\n\n   _ _ _\n\n   The Green Bank Telescope has been described as an ear to the\nsky. But that's not exactly right.\n\n   A radio telescope doesn't ``hear'' radio signals from outer\nspace any more than a car radio ``hears'' a Dixie Chicks song\nbroadcast by a country music station. Both have an antenna that\ncollects radio waves, said McKinnon. The car radio converts these\nwaves into sounds. The radio telescope translates them into images\nor graphs that let astronomers learn about unseen objects in the\ndistant universe.\n\n   Radio signals reaching Earth from faraway galaxies are feeble,\noften barely discernible. So astronomers are constructing\never-bigger antennae to catch them.\n\n   ``Just like you can capture more raindrops in a bigger bucket,''\nexplained McKinnon. ``The GBT has two acres of collecting area. You\ncould build eight houses on it. It will be the largest fully\nsteerable radio telescope in the world.''\n\n   In addition to its size, the GBT has new technologies aimed at\nhelping astronomers examine the edges of the universe.\n\n   ``First, there's the offset feed arm,'' said McKinnon.\n\n   In all radio telescopes, the antenna is a parabolic dish that\ncatches the radio signal and focuses it on a receiver. Earlier\nmodels used support arms to hold the receiver over the middle of\nthe dish, but the arms blocked some of the incoming radio waves.\nThe GBT's angled feed arm holds the receiver without interfering\nwith incoming signals. The same design is used on some small home\nTV satellite dishes.\n\n   Another technological advance is the GBT's ``active surface,''\nsaid McKinnon. The surface of its parabolic dish is a mosaic of\n2,004 moveable aluminium panels mounted on ``actuators.'' As the\ngiant dish is turned and tilted to face the incoming radio waves,\ncomputers adjust the actuators to ensure that the surface is\nabsolutely smooth and is focusing the desired signal on the\nreceiver.\n\n   The telescope is surrounded by 12 range finders that use lasers\nto scan the surface of the dish for any irregularities caused by\nsun or wind. If the hot summer sun has expanded an exposed section\nof the frame by a fraction of an inch, for instance, the lasers\nwill trigger a corrective movement of the surface panels.\n\n   The collected radio signals from space are transmitted via fiber\noptics from the telescope receiver to a control room and\nobservatory about a mile away. To keep its electronic equipment\nfrom tainting the signal from space with their own faint radio\nwaves, this control room is lined with copper wallpaper.\n\n   Astronomers use old diesel cars and trucks to drive to and from\nthe telescope _ eliminating the interference generated by spark\nplugs in conventional gas-powered vehicles.\n\n   The 16 million-pound telescope sits on 16 gigantic steel wheels\nthat roll on a circular metal track 210 feet across. The track\nrests on a reinforced concrete foundation that extends 25 feet\nbelow ground to the bedrock.\n\n   A gigantic gear raises and lowers the elevation of the huge _\nbut delicately balanced _ parabolic dish and the offset arm that\nangles over it. This whole asymmetrical shebang is made of welded\nsteel beams that had to be trucked in over the mountainous roads.\n\n   Despite its enormous size, the GBT is designed to operate more\nprecisely than a quartz watch, said McKinnon.\n\n   _ _ _\n\n   Astronomers from around the world will use the GBT.\n\n   The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the\nNational Science Foundation, a federal agency, and operated under\nan agreement with Associated Universities, Inc., a consortium of\nacademic institutions. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory has\nother telescopes at Socorro, N.M., and Kitt Peak, Ariz.\n\n   The facilities operate under an ``open sky policy,'' explained\nMcKinnon. Leading astronomers submit research proposals and\nrequests for time on a telescope. A panel of scientific referees\ndecides which projects are worthy. Highly trained telescope\noperators help conduct these searches of outer space. Sometimes the\ndata is transmitted over the Internet, sparing astronomers the trip\nto isolated telescope sites.\n\n   There are trade-offs for scientists living here in the center of\nthe National Radio Quiet Zone, set up by the Federal Communications\nCommission to protect the purity of signals from outer space.\n\n   There's no better place for a radio telescope. But it's an hour\nand a half drive to the grocery store or a movie. Winter weather\ncan be brutal. On the other hand, by staying on the second-grade\nhonor roll, 8-year-old Caitlin McKinnon earns free skiing\nprivileges for herself and her parents on nearby Snowshoe slopes.\n\n   Acceptance into the community is sometimes slow. Fertile\nflatland is rare and coveted. Some farmers resented that the\nobservatory seized such a prime spot. West Virginia has been stung\nby companies that deserted the state after clearing forests for\ntimber or bulldozing mountaintops for coal.\n\n   There are lingering suspicions that ``outsiders come to take,''\nsaid McKinnon, who has lived at Green Bank for eight years.\n\n   The mountains are beautiful but harsh, said Samons, the barber\nand preacher. ``I wouldn't live anywhere else.''\n\n   Bob Dart's e-mail address is bobdart(at)coxnews.com\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   GREEN BANK, W.Va. _ The world's largest machine on dry land\nseems out of place in the rugged isolation of Deer Creek Valley.\n","\n   But this patch of scarce flatland, sparsely populated and\nsurrounded by the Allegheny Mountains, is the ideal home for the\ngleaming white two-acre radio telescope that looms above\nneighboring farms.\n","\n   For four decades, this remote Pocahontas County hamlet has been\n``the center of American radio astronomy,'' explained Mark\nMcKinnon, deputy site director of the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory facility at Green Bank.\n","\n   Shielded by the mountains from earthly interference such as\nradio stations, Green Bank's sensitive telescopes have explored\ndistant galaxies by collecting radio waves since 1958.
