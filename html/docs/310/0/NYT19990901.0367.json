Then,\nMcNulty began telephoning assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston,\none of the federal prosecutors in Waco who had handled the criminal\ncase against several Branch Davidians.\n\n   ``He was very skeptical when he heard who I was,'' McNulty said.\n\n   McNulty placed scores of calls to Johnston, prodding and\ncajoling for access to the locked state evidence room. Toward the\nend of 1998, McNulty said he confronted Johnston with copies of\nrecords from Fort Bragg, N.C., that suggested members of an elite\nmilitary unit were present at Waco.\n\n   In fact, he had obtained the documents from Hardy. Unlike the\nJustice Department or the FBI, the military responded quickly to\nHardy's FOIA requests, providing documents that detailed how\nmembers of the elite Delta Force military unit were present at Waco\nduring the day of the fire. The Pentagon now says there were three\nDelta Force soldiers present as observers.\n\n   Eventually, Johnston decided that McNulty should be allowed to\nperuse the evidence with a camera crew. He said he contacted the\nhead of the Justice Department's office of public relations in\nWashington for final approval.\n\n   ``I didn't want to be a party to even the appearance of\nstonewalling him,'' said Johnston. ``Ultimately, this is the\npublic's evidence.''\n\n   Between November 1998 and March 1999, McNulty said he paid four\nvisits to the evidence rooms in Austin, always escorted by at least\none Texas Ranger.\n\n   He said he found at least four projectiles that he believes are\npyrotechnic and other potentially flammable devices known as\n``flashbangs'' that had been discovered inside the compound.\n\n   On one visit, McNulty said he brought a munitions expert to take\nsamples for later testing. He said he reported his finding to the\nTexas Rangers, noting that some evidence listed on the inventory\nwas missing or mislabeled.\n\n   Hardy, the lawyer, meanwhile, had continued to try to get both\nthe Rangers and the Justice Department to grant his FOIA requests.\nFrustrated, he said he made copies of his correspondence and sent\nthem to Jerry Patterson, a former Texas state senator. Patterson is\na conservative Republican who authored the state's 1995 concealed\nweapons law.\n\n   ``I guess I'm the go-to-guy for the black helicopter crowd,''\njoked Patterson, now a lobbyist in Austin. He said Hardy's Texas\nfriends ``called me up and said the Department of Public Safety has\npossession of evidence that brings a whole new light on what\nhappened at Waco. We feared that the evidence will be turned over\nto the Department of Justice never to see the light of day.''\n\n   Patterson said he first contacted Clay Johnson, chief of staff\nfor Gov. George W. Bush, who referred him to James B. Francis Jr.,\nchairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety. He said he met\nwith Francis, explaining that neither the Rangers nor the Justice\nDepartment claimed to control access to the Waco evidence.\n\n   ``It was a mess,'' Francis said in an interview.\n\n   This summer, the Department of Public Safety began an\ninvestigation of the evidence in the storage rooms. Francis said\nthe Rangers would complete their report in time to respond to a\ncongressional subpoena for a hearing planned for Sept. 7. The\ndepartment also asked U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. to\ntake possession of all evidence related to the Branch Davidian\ncase, much of which remains with the federal government.\n\n   In a sweeping order issued earlier this month, Smith ordered the\ngovernment to hand over everything ``in any way relevant'' to the\nBranch Davidian siege and subsequent fire. The judge noted that the\nplaintiffs in the civil case ``have a right to seek access'' to the\nevidence. On Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers sought to block\nSmith's order and maintain control of the evidence.\n\n   ``Once the court decided that the evidence was worth taking\ncontrol of, it was the triggering device of everything that has\nhappened since then,'' Francis said.\n\n   Francis would only speak in broad terms about the evidence, but\nhe said there were eyewitness accounts and photographs that raised\nquestions about whether the Delta Force participated at Waco. By\nlaw, military units such as the Delta Force are allowed to observe\nbut not operate inside the United States.\n\n   ``There are military guys in body armor and in face paint,''\nsaid Francis, describing pieces of evidence. ``It might be\nsignificant evidence when all the facts come out.''\n\n   Unless Smith grants a continuance, the wrongful death lawsuit\nwill begin in about a month. Michael Caddell, the lead plaintiff's\nlawyer, said that government lawyers have stymied all of his\ndiscovery attempts since the case was filed in 1994.\n\n   Thus, Caddell said he has had to rely on McNulty and Hardy to\nprovide him with copies of documents and evidence. He estimated\nthat he has paid McNulty between $40,000 and $50,000 for services\nsuch as testing of evidence, lab work and investigative help.\n\n   ``His access to information has been critical,'' Caddell said.\n``He has looked at information that Congress didn't see and the FBI\ndidn't see or didn't want to acknowledge.'' Without evidence\nprovided to him by McNulty and Hardy, Caddell said Smith might have\ngranted a government motion to dismiss the case.\n\n   Finally, everything was pushed fully into the public eye last\nweek when a former senior FBI official told Lee Hancock of the The\nDallas Morning News that two potentially flammable tear-gas\nprojectiles were used at Waco by an FBI hostage rescue team on the\nsame morning as the fire.\n\n   The official, Danny Coulson, said he learned of the canisters in\nrecent weeks after years in which FBI officials, including himself,\nhad denied that any potentially flammable projectiles were used. He\ndeclined to say how he heard of the canisters. Justice Department\nofficials initially denied Coulson's claims but later recanted.\n\n   In an interview earlier this week, Coulson reiterated his belief\nthat the canisters were not connected to fire. On that day, FBI\nagents using tanks had sprayed tear gas into the Branch Davidian\ncompound in an attempt to forcibly end the siege.\n\n   ``The significance as it applies to the fire is none,'' Coulson\nsaid. ``The real significance is that the attorney general and many\nFBI officials, including myself, have given statements that\npyrotechnic devices were not used, and now we know that is an\nerror. It goes to the very credibility of the inquiry conducted by\nthe Department of Justice.''\n\n   For critics of McNulty and Hardy, the new admissions by the\ngovernment are particularly frustrating. ``They deserve a little\nbit of credit,'' Pitcavage said grudgingly. ``But you wish that\nsomeone else had discovered this stuff instead. These guys have\nulterior motives.''\n\n   But Hardy and McNulty make no apologies. ``I'm downright happy\nabout it,'' said Hardy.\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   Until just over a year ago neither McNulty nor Hardy had been\nable to collect much, if any, evidence from the government.
