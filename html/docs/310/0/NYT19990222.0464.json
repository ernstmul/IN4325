STICKNEY JR. \nc.1999 Houston Chronicle \n \n\n   HOUSTON _ Kim Perrot, a 5-foot-5-inch pillar of strength on the\nbasketball court during the Houston Comets' two WNBA championship\nseasons, cried frequently Monday as she talked of being diagnosed\nwith lung and brain cancer and discussed the difficult fight now\nconfronting her.\n\n   ``This has been a tough moment for me,'' Perrot said. ``But I've\nalways had to battle. And this is just another battle.''\n\n   For most of the past month, Perrot has been subjected to\nnumerous tests at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston to determine\nthe cause of periodic headaches and weakness in her arms. On\nFriday, she was informed of the results: Cancer that began in her\nlungs had spread to her brain.\n\n   As she talked of her ordeal Monday, Perrot sat with two of the\nComets' team doctors, two of the three cancer specialists in whose\nhands her future rests and Comets coach Van Chancellor.\n\n   Throughout the news conference at the Westside Tennis Club,\nPerrot clutched the hand of Chancellor, who over the past two years\nhas gone from a coach she once despised to a father figure.\n\n   ``I believe with all my heart and faith in God that I will\novercome this,'' she said. ``And my goal is to be back on the\nbasketball court at 110 percent, doing what I've been doing for the\nlast two years.''\n\n   Doctors have said it's too early to offer a complete prognosis.\nBut Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chief of neurosurgery at M.D. Anderson\nCancer Center, said the lung cancer, alveolar adenocarcinoma that\nwas classified as advanced, is the biggest long-term worry.\n\n   The brain tumors _ one golf-ball-size tumor and a few smaller\nones _ offer the most immediate threat, however.\n\n   Sawaya said the smaller tumors ``are of no immediate concern\nright now ... The larger one is best treated if removed.''\n\n   Because the golf-ball-size tumor did not originate in the brain,\nSawaya said there is a high probability it can be removed and not\ngrow back. It is on the left side, immediately beneath the brain's\nsurface and near the motor cortex that controls power to the\nmuscles.\n\n   During surgery expected to last about four hours Wednesday,\ndoctors will use critical mapping, which measures function on the\nsurface of the brain, to determine which part of the brain to cut\nthrough to remove the tumor without causing paralysis. Two weeks of\nradiation will follow the surgery.\n\n   The cancer in the lungs is more of an unknown. But doctors said\nthere is no reason to think Perrot won't respond to treatment _\nabout six months of chemotherapy.\n\n   Sawaya said it is hard to imagine Perrot playing competitively\nthis season. But he admitted he was hesitant to say that, because\nchemotherapy treatment is hard to predict.\n\n   Dr. Taylor Wharton, special assistant to the president of M.D.\nAnderson and an oncologist, said Perrot probably began to\nexperience symptoms associated with the lung cancer last fall.\nAlthough lung cancer is most often associated with heavy smokers,\nWharton said Perrot ``is a nonsmoker and a nondrinker.''\n\n   ``Lifestyle has nothing to do with it,'' Wharton said. ``It's\njust a low-frequency, random event. And unfortunately, it caught up\nwith one of our star athletes.''\n\n   Perrot said she gains comfort from living in Houston, where\nfacilities and personnel such as those at M.D. Anderson are readily\navailable.\n\n   ``It was a shock to me to even think this would happen to me,''\nshe said. ``But I've accepted it. I've dealt with it, and the last\nweeks that I have been meeting with the doctors at M.D. Anderson\nhave really made me feel confident.\n\n   ``I trust that they are the best and will take real good care of\nme. So it is an asset to be in a city where they have the best\ndoctors in the world.''\n\n   Chancellor said he has no doubt Perrot will overcome her\nillness.\n\n   ``When I think of how tough she is,'' he said, ``she's going to\nfight this, and she'll be back playing one day. I just don't see\nthis as being a battle she can't win. She's small; she's overcome\nthat on the basketball court. She's just won every battle you can\nwin.''\n\n   Monica Lamb, starting center for the Comets during their repeat\nseason as champions of the Women's National Basketball Association,\nsaid Perrot's teammates were all shocked upon hearing of her\ntroubles.\n\n   ``It's so ironic and so tragic,'' said Lamb. ``She is the most\nhealth-conscious on this team.\n\n   ``And I like to say that this disease has just barked upon the\nwrong tree. Kim is relentless against her foes. I have no doubt she\nwill attack this in the same manner, the same fashion, all the\nway.''\n\n   Added Perrot, ``I just want to thank all my fans, my family and\nfriends for their support.
