Times News Service    \n\n   Linda Gillick began her quest convinced that science and a\nlittle common sense could explain why in one ordinary patch of New\nJersey seashore, an unusual number of children, her son Michael\namong them, have similar types of cancers.\n\n   She reasoned that it must be something in the water or air, some\nunnoticed chemical lurking under a toxic-waste dump or factory _\nbut in any case, a specific factor that she assumed could be\nlocated, analyzed and then eradicated.\n\n   ``When you have something that is grossly abnormal, you need to\nfind out the indicator that is different from somewhere else,''\nsaid Mrs. Gillick, who organized a movement that persuaded the\nstate to make a comprehensive environmental study of her town, Toms\nRiver, and of surrounding Dover Township in Ocean County. ``What do\nwe have that's different? That's the key.''\n\n   As logical as it may sound, Mrs. Gillick's assumption represents\na challenge to science's traditional approach to cancer clusters.\nMany scientists say that there is a lot of cancer everywhere and\nthat neighborhood concentrations of the disease result from chance,\nnot from the environment. But people who live in areas where the\nincidence of cancer is higher than expected have rarely been\ncontent with that explanation.\n\n   Many of these people are turning their discontent into political\naction. Armed with the clout that gave them an audience with\nPresident Clinton in August and a starring role in some of New York\nSen. Alfonse D'Amato's re-election campaign advertisements, they\nhave become a driving force behind tens of millions of dollars'\nworth of new research into cancer clusters.\n\n   ``This is pushing science to a new era _ of ecogenetic\nepidemiology,'' which looks at geographical variations of disease,\nsaid Ruth Allen, an environmental epidemiologist with the Federal\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. She is the agency's project leader\nfor a $21 million study of elevated breast cancer rates on Long\nIsland, N.Y. ``This is where molecular biomarkers of disease and\ngeographical variations are examined together.''\n\n   Across the United States, health officials are re-examining old\nmonitoring data, using newly refined techniques to search for\nchemicals that may not have been looked at in earlier air, water\nand soil tests in communities where cancer clusters are suspected.\n\n   An array of ambitious studies are under way using plain gumshoe\ndetective work combined with computer mapping that can fine-tune\nthe picture of what is in a community's environment, identify how\npeople might be exposed to synthetic chemicals and determine\nwhether small amounts of such chemicals may be toxic to humans.\n\n   In addition to the investigation of certain childhood cancers in\nDover Township and breast cancer on Long Island, there are\nstatewide studies of cancer and chemical use in Connecticut and\nCalifornia, a federal study of elevated breast cancer deaths in\nmid-Atlantic and Northeast states, and federal studies of childhood\nand adult brain cancers near toxic-waste sites in several states.\n\n   Cancer clusters _ the term is used to describe\nhigher-than-expected concentrations of similar cancers in one\ndiscrete area _ have been in the national vocabulary for decades.\nThey can be difficult to document with standard statistical\nanalysis. Sometimes the data involve such small numbers of cases\nthat epidemiologists cannot reach a conclusion about whether an\nanomaly exists. Sometimes, according to the National Cancer\nInstitute, scientists find ``a true excess,'' but cannot explain\nit.\n\n   ``There are so many types of cancer and birth defects that just\nby chance alone you'd expect any one of them to be high in any one\nlittle town,'' said Dr. Bruce Ames, a biochemist and molecular\nbiologist who directs the National Institute of Environmental\nHealth Sciences Center at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n   Expressing a view widely held in the scientific world, he said\nthat the money devoted to research into environmental links to\ncancer is misspent and that there is ``no convincing evidence''\nthat synthetic chemicals in the atmosphere are an important cause\nof cancer in humans. ``I'd put my money into basic research, not\ninto chasing hypothetical risks,'' Ames said.\n\n   Like a growing number of citizen activists, the Gillick family\nwas not willing to have Dover Township's record of childhood\ncancers written off as a statistical fluke. The township in\nsouthern New Jersey has had 90 cases over a 12-year period,\ncompared with the 67 cases that New Jersey health officials said\ncould be expected during that time.\n\n   ``It's important to look at everything _ the water, the soil,\nthe air, all of it, and try to find an answer,'' said Michael\nGillick, who was found to have neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects\nthe nervous system, when he was 3{ months old.\n\n   Now 19, his growth stunted and his body painfully contorted by\nthe disease, he said he realizes that all the research may never\ntell him why he, or any other cancer victim, is sick. ``It's too\nlate for me,'' Gillick said. ``I already have what I have. I accept\nit. It's my wish that this not happen to others.''\n\n   Public clamor for answers has prodded many states, including New\nYork and New Jersey, to process and publish cancer data faster.\n\n   In April, for example, the New York state Assembly appropriated\n$1 million for a comprehensive statewide cancer-mapping project. It\nwas to correlate the types and locations of specific cancers,\ninformation already assembled in the state cancer registry, with\nneighborhood-specific data on past and present water quality,\npesticide and chemical emissions, radiation exposure, industrial\npollution and local toxic-waste sites.\n\n   Although Gov. George Pataki vetoed the appropriation, he\npromised that the Health Department would do the study from its own\nbudget. But a department spokeswoman, Claire Pospisil, then said it\ncould not create a meaningful map until it upgraded the registry.\nThis year the department published data from 1994 for the registry;\nits goal is to have 1996 data assembled and published by the end of\nthis year.\n\n   Many states, including Hawaii, Illinois and California, have\nundertaken statewide cancer-mapping projects. The proliferation of\ncancer mapping reflects a growing trend nationwide to integrate two\nsets of data that are widely and publicly available: one on\ntoxic-chemical releases and the other on geographical variations in\nthe incidence of some diseases. The trend follows a decade of\nintense focus on cancer risk factors like diet, lifestyle and\nheredity.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   ``Communities now are saying we don't have any of these risk\nfactors, and still we have a problem,'' said Dr. Allen of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. ``They ask common-sense questions\nthat are at once simple and profound.''\n\n   Dr. Allen said that ``scientists have new tools and new\nhypotheses that they are testing,'' but that the political impetus\nfor environmental research came after cancer-cluster activists in\nplaces like Toms River and Long Island presented elected officials\nwith raw data from their own homemade cancer maps. Politicians have\nresponded.\n\n   ``They now look at graphical information and say: `Gee, in my\ndistrict it's this number and in yours it's that. What's going\non?''' Dr. Allen said.\n\n   Policy-makers have acted on perceived health risks that are\nconsidered merely hypothetical by the scientific establishment. The\nsurgeon-general first recommended putting warnings on cigarette\npacks in 1964, when the American Medical Association did not yet\nconsider smoking the main cause of cancer.\n\n   In the Long Island breast-cancer study, the federal government\nis sponsoring more than a dozen studies that focus heavily on the\npossible role of environmental factors in the high breast-cancer\nrates in parts of the island..\n\n   Some try to correlate cancer incidence with historical data on\nwind patterns, groundwater flow and the accumulation of pesticides\nover time in the soil. Others involve new toxicological tests on\n220 chemicals that might be found on Long Island. Half of them were\nadded to the list at the demand of local activists.\n\n   Similarly, when the New Jersey authorities were pressed two\nyears ago investigate what some experts said was a statistically\nunusual incidence of some childhood cancers in Dover Township, they\nagreed to look for 235 substances instead of the 85 they usually\nmonitor in drinking water.\n\n   In the course of the testing, they found traces of a chemical\ncompound, or trimer, that is a byproduct of styrene and\nacrylonitrile. Both chemicals, used for decades in local factories,\nare listed as carcinogens by the EPA.\n\n   The route to the water system, according to preliminary research\nresults, appears to be from a Superfund toxic-waste dump, which\nreceived waste from these factories, less than one mile from a well\nfield serving Dover Township.\n\n   When New Jersey officials examined old records of what was in\nthe drinking water, they said they found that the compound had been\npresent for at least 10 years. It was not investigated further,\nbecause it was not on the list of state and federally regulated\npollutants. The trimer is now being tested to determine if it is a\nhuman carcinogen.\n\n   It is too early to draw any conclusions about whether there is a\nrelationship between human cancers and the trimer, said James\nBlumenstock, acting senior assistant commissioner of the state\nDepartment of Health and Senior Services. But he said the study is\nprompting a reassessment of which and how many chemicals should be\nregulated. ``As science advances,'' he said, ``our ability to\nmeasure and detect contaminants will improve.''\n\n   Public pressure to conduct the Dover Township study also focused\nattention on the New Jersey cancer registry, which was found to be\ntoo out of date to be useful. The data bank has since been updated,\nand the state Assembly passed a law that set fines of up to $1,000\na day for medical personnel who fail to file timely reports of\ncancer cases.\n\n   Dover Township's study is only one of many efforts to take a\nfresh look at childhood cancer and possible risks to children from\nchemicals in the environment.\n\n   The National Cancer Institute, for example, is financing a\npioneering study in California of potential links between\npesticides and childhood cancers. It was spurred by the discovery\nof an unexpectedly high number of brain cancers in children in the\nCentral Valley town of McFarland.\n\n   ``When we realized how impossible it is to explain why any one\ncluster exists, we tried to step back from looking at specific\nclusters and look at the big picture, whether there are patterns of\nrisk we should be paying attention to,'' said Peggy Reynolds, chief\nof the environmental epidemiology and geographic information system\nsection of the state health department.\n\n   The momentum behind cluster studies caught other health\nofficials off guard. Mary Lerchen, an epidemiologist with the\ncancer surveillance branch of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said the federal centers cannot keep track of the\nballooning number of studies and is seeking money to set up a\ncancer-cluster registry that could coordinate research findings.\n\n   ``Seldom have we found the cause of a cancer because a cluster\nbrought it to our attention,'' Dr. Lerchen said, ``but you never\nknow, and you certainly can't start out with that attitude.''\n","Headline":"\nPUBLIC CLAMOR SPURS RESEARCH ON CANCER CLUSTERS \n","Text":["\n   Linda Gillick began her quest convinced that science and a\nlittle common sense could explain why in one ordinary patch of New\nJersey seashore, an unusual number of children, her son Michael\namong them, have similar types of cancers.\n","\n   She reasoned that it must be something in the water or air, some\nunnoticed chemical lurking under a toxic-waste dump or factory _\nbut in any case, a specific factor that she assumed could be\nlocated, analyzed and then eradicated.\n","\n   ``When you have something that is grossly abnormal, you need to\nfind out the indicator that is different from somewhere else,''\nsaid Mrs. Gillick, who organized a movement that persuaded the\nstate to make a comprehensive environmental study of her town, Toms\nRiver, and of surrounding Dover Township in Ocean County. ``What do\nwe have that's different?
