ALTMAN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   After sitting in pieces in a jar for more than 40 years, Albert\nEinstein's brain could make yet another contribution to science.\nNow scientists in Canada say they have spotted something that might\nexplain the great theorist's brilliance _ and might eventually\noffer clues to brainwork in general.\n\n   They say a key region in Einstein's brain _ a region that\nprocesses mathematical thought, three-dimensional visualization,\nspatial relationships and other mental processes _ was\nsignificantly larger than the same area in people with normal\nintelligence. Known as the inferior parietal lobe, the region is\nsituated about the level of the ear, starting in the front of the\nbrain and extending about two-thirds of the way back.\n\n   In his life, Einstein had submitted to brain studies and at\nleast one biography says he hoped his brain would be studied after\nhis death. When Einstein died in 1955, in Princeton, N.J., a\npathologist who performed the autopsy removed the brain and kept it\nwhen he left Princeton. According to several journalistic accounts,\nthe pathologist, Dr. Thomas Harvey, kept Einstein's brain in a jar\nand at one time it sat in a cardboard box that once held apple\ncider behind a beer cooler in his office in Kansas.\n\n   Harvey had permission from Einstein's estate and his son, Hans\nAlbert, to conduct studies of the brain. Toward that end, he\nphotographed and measured the brain and then cut it into 240 pieces\nof varying size for further study, but he published nothing of his\nfindings. He did give a few sections of the brain to a few\nresearchers, two of whom reported that Einstein had an unusual\npreponderance of certain brain cells, oligodendroglia, which\nsupport the brain's networks of neurons.\n\n   In 1996, though, a one-sentence fax from Harvey arrived at\nMcMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Did researchers\nwant to study Einstein's brain? Dr. Sandra F. Witelson, the leader\nof a team of neuroscientists there, did not even know who he was.\n\n   But the result was a research project combining a method similar\nto long-rejected system of phrenology with the newer techniques of\nneuroscience. Dr. Witelson's team made use of McMaster's vast\nlibrary of brain samples, probably the world's largest collection\nof normal brain samples. These samples enabled them to determine\nwhich features of Einstein's brain were ordinary, and which were\nunusual.\n\n   The results of their work are reported in Saturday's issue of\nthe medical journal The Lancet.\n\n   It remains to be seen if the unusual physical features of\nEinstein's brain can explain his phenomenal success as a theorist\nof physics. Over the years, scientists have often theorized that\none aspect or another of the brain's shape related to mental\nfunctioning, only to have the theories fail.\n\n   Still, the researchers in Canada feel they have strong\nscientific backing for their theories. Einstein's inferior parietal\nlobe was 15 percent wider than that of normal people; his brain did\nnot have a groove that normally runs through the parietal area, a\nfinding a ``unique'' among the brains the team studied, Dr.\nWitelson said. The absence of the groove may have allowed more\nbrain cells, or neurons, in the area to establish connections\nbetween each other and work together more easily, the team's report\nsaid.\n\n   Harvey could not be reached for comment.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   But he apparently chose the McMaster researchers after reading\nDr. Witelson's reports of research conducted at a brain bank that\nshe started in 1982, largely through funding from the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health. The bank contains brains from more than 100\nindividuals who willed their brains for research, and who underwent\nmany tests of verbal, mathematical, IQ and other psychological\nfunctions. The aim was to relate structure and function in the\nnormal brain, said Dr. Witelson, who veered into neuro-anatomy\nafter earning her Ph.D. degree in psychology.\n\n   At least 35 brain banks exist in North America and Europe, but\nmost collect brains of people with various neurological and\npsychological disorders. The McMaster University bank has what is\nbelieved to be the largest collection of brains from people\ndocumented to be cognitively normal.\n\n   So Harvey's invitation offered an extraordinary opportunity to\nstudy an extraordinary mind. In an interview, Dr. Witelson said she\nrealized at the outset that the work might conclude in a dead end.\nBut she said, ``If there is going to be any relationship between\nstructure and function, you might see it more clearly in an\nextraordinary case.''\n\n   Researchers have long conducted studies of brains of scientists\nand brilliant people after their death, but this work has been\nseriously hampered by several factors. Such studies were confined\nto the brain of a single person and brains from other people with\ndifferent levels of intelligence were not available for comparison.\nAnd scientists lacked theories about the relation between brain\nstructure and psychological function to test in such studies.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   In examining Einstein's brain, Dr. Witelson relied on findings\nfrom other scientists that relate the size of a brain region and\nlevel of certain cognitive abilities. Such findings suggest that\ndifferences in people's ability to perform certain cognitive\nfunctions may be due in part to physical differences in the regions\nof their brains that control the functions.\n\n   Dr. Witelson theorized that if any difference was found it was\nmost likely to be in the parietal lobes. But she said she did not\nconfine her studies to that region.\n\n   Dr. Witelson began examining the photographs and measurements\nthat Harvey had made of Einstein's brain from a number of different\nangles. Harvey also brought to Dr. Witelson's laboratory about 50\npieces, or a fifth of Einstein's brain, so she could also study\nthem through a microscope.\n\n   Dr. Witelson then compared the measurements of Einstein's brain\nwith those from 35 males and 56 females, all Canadians. Their\naverage IQ was about 115, a little higher than average. They\nincluded singers, architects and blue collar workers.\n\n   Because Einstein's brain was being compared with those of people\nwho died at age 60 on average, and Einstein was 76 when he died,\nthe scientists also compared his brain to the eight oldest members\nof the study. Their age averaged 70. Beyond the anomalies in\nEinstein's parietal lobe, there was no significant difference.\n\n   Einstein's brain weight and the front-to-back, top-to-bottom\nmeasurements were within the normal range of the comparison group\nand of individuals from other published studies, Dr. Witelson said.\n\n   ``That clearly shows that you don't have to have a big brain to\nbe brilliant,'' Dr. Witelson said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   But Dr. Witelson found two anomalies in the parietal lobes.\n\n   One was quantitative. Einstein's parietal lobes were about 15\npercent wider on each side, a finding that was statistically\nsignificant.\n\n   The second anomaly was ``unique,'' Dr. Witelson said. A large\ngroove known as the Sylvian fissure was absent. ``The inferior\nparietal region was not separated by this big fissure as is present\nin every other brain we've seen and in every other depiction in any\nhuman atlas of postmortem brains,'' Dr. Witelson said.\n\n   A few areas of Einstein's brain, such as his temporal lobes and\nthe top-to-bottom measurement, ``looked a bit smaller'' than the\naverage, Dr. Witelson said. ``When you put that all together, this\nis why the overall brain was not different'' in size.\n\n   The Sylvian fissure, which is also called the lateral fissure,\nis a major anatomical feature of the brain and is well-established\nat birth. Thus, Dr. Witelson said, her team theorizes that the\nanomaly was present from birth and was not the result of an\nenvironmental factor.\n\n   Dr. Witelson said the theory is supported by an oft-repeated\nstory that Einstein's mother was worried that he might be retarded\nbecause his head seemed large and misshapen at birth and his speech\nwas slow to develop. Einstein did not speak until he was 3 years\nold and later had trouble forming sentences.\n\n   ``We don't know if it was genetic, but if I had to guess I'd say\nit was genetic,'' Dr. Witelson said.\n\n   Dr. Witelson said that fear of media attention kept her from\ndiscussing the findings, even with other scientists who had\nreceived a small number of pieces of Einstein's brain from Harvey.\nOn Thursday, Dr. Witelson said she could not answer all the calls\nfrom news organizations.\n\n   Dr. Witelson said she did not know what further studies of\nEinstein's brain she will pursue. A hope is that she and other\nscientists will use modern imaging techniques such as CAT scan\nX-rays, MRI scans and PET scans to determine whether similar brain\nanomalies can be identified in other people with exceptional,\nnormal and low intellect.\n","Headline":"\nSCIENTISTS STUDYING EINSTEIN'S BRAIN FIND CLUES TO HIS BRILLIANCE \n","Text":["\n   After sitting in pieces in a jar for more than 40 years, Albert\nEinstein's brain could make yet another contribution to science.\nNow scientists in Canada say they have spotted something that might\nexplain the great theorist's brilliance _ and might eventually\noffer clues to brainwork in general.\n","\n   They say a key region in Einstein's brain _ a region that\nprocesses mathematical thought, three-dimensional visualization,\nspatial relationships and other mental processes _ was\nsignificantly larger than the same area in people with normal\nintelligence.
