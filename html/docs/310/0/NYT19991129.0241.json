Most scientists dismissed it after a scientific committee\nreviewed the theory and deemed the probability very low. But that\npanel based its conclusion in part on a published finding that was\nlater shown to be in error. And now a remarkable new book, ``The\nRiver'' by Edward Hooper, offers tantalizing clues to revive and\nexpand the polio vaccine theory. By Lawrence K. Altman.

The robotic Mars Polar Lander is being\naimed for a landing on Friday on the vast terraces of ice and dust\na few hundred miles from the planet's south pole. Spring is turning\nto summer there, the season of constant sunlight, which the\nspacecraft will draw on for energy to power its computer and\ntransmitter and array of cameras, sensors, digging arm and ovens\nfor heating and analyzing soil samples.

The hospital is always filled with\npatients with fevers no one understands. In some, it is a sign of\nan underlying disease that is not yet known. In other people, like\nAIDS or cancer patients with suppressed immune systems, the fever\nmay have any number of causes, including their underlying disease\nor, most dangerously, an infection that could rapidly kill if left\nuntreated. Whatever the case may be, mysterious fevers are common,\nand among the most vexing of medical problems.

Current medical textbooks state\nthat just 1 percent of girls younger than 8 show signs of puberty.\nIn a new review of existing data, in the Oct. 4 issue of the\njournal Pediatrics, researchers concluded that ``the onset of\nbreast development between 7 and 8 years of age in white girls and\nbetween 6 and 8 years in African-American girls may be part of the\nnormal broad variation in the timing of puberty and not, in most\ncases, a pathological state.''
