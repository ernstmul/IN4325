Times News Service   \n\n   LONDON _ Richard Branson was fiddling with one of his new\nVirgin-brand mobile telephones in the living room of his Notting\nHill town house here last week.\n\n   ``I'm trying to think how it works,'' he said, staring at a\nspecial button on the phone _ a red button, with the Virgin logo.\nThe button connects customers by voice to operators who also handle\ndistribution for the Virgin.com Web site. With such a call,\ncustomers can order plane tickets, CD's and an assortment of other\nproducts that Branson usually hawks by nondigital means. After\ntrying fitfully to explain the red-button function, he finally\nconceded that he wasn't sure how it worked, and gave up.\n\n   ``I was one of those anti-mobile phone guys before we did Virgin\nMobile,'' he explained, referring to the cellular phone service\nthat he started in November and that has already signed up 300,000\nsubscribers.\n\n   Hands-on technical savvy or not, Branson is diving head first\ninto the digital economy. Call it the dot-comming of the Virgin\nGroup PLC.\n\n   Branson, the brash, 48-year-old British billionaire who founded\nVirgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet plying the\nLondon-New York route, now owns a hodgepodge of more than 200\nVirgin-branded businesses. And he intends to turn his\ntarmac-and-mortar world into something a bit more virtual.\n\n   Having slapped the Virgin logo on planes, trains, soda, vodka,\nclothing, movie theaters, music stores, a radio station, a\nfinancial services company and even a wedding coordinator, Branson\nmeans to expand his year-old Virgin.com Web site into a worldwide\ne-commerce portal that he hopes will take on some of the qualities\nof Amazon.com.\n\n   The skeptics say he is already too late to the Internet market\nand will surely stumble. ``A lot of traditional businesses have\nmade these kinds of plans and they've never worked out,'' said Noah\nYasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in London.\n\n   But Branson sees himself as specially suited for an\nentrepreneurial leap onto the Web.\n\n   For one thing, unlike Amazon.com _ which began as a book\ndistributor and is now a diversified digital middleman _ the Virgin\nGroup has many of its own products to sell. That doesn't mean,\nthough, that Branson plans to hold his Web customers hostage to the\nVirgin brand.\n\n   ``If British Airways is selling better products than Virgin\nAtlantic, we'll sell the British Airways product,'' he said. ``If\nFidelity is offering a better financial product than Virgin Direct,\nwe'll recommend the Fidelity product.''\n\n   Branson says he will not get snagged on the sticking point that\nhas caused other brand-name companies to stumble on their way to\ncyberspace _ the fear of cannibalizing the established offline\nbrands. ``It's a fact of life,'' he said, ``that the Internet will\nkill off some of our business and severely damage a lot of\nconventional industry.''\n\n   And then there's the matter of management and money, which in\nthe case of the privately held Virgin Group resides chiefly in one\nman: Richard Branson, boss and banker, rolled into one.\n\n   Having sold 49 percent of his Virgin Atlantic unit to Singapore\nAirlines for $965 million right before Christmas, Branson has cash\nto burn. And unlike most dot-com's, he notes, his money is real _\nnot the paper wealth of newly minted Internet stock.\n\n   But whatever the advantages Branson describes, Virgin is\nentering the Internet arena too late to claim the ``first mover''\nedge that Web executives like to tout.\n\n   Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, says that most of the major\nsectors of the Web are already carved up by companies like Yahoo\nand Amazon.com. ``At least in the U.S. market, Virgin will have a\nvery hard time competing,'' he said, adding that outside the United\nStates ``Virgin still has a little time to grab some market\nshare.''\n\n   For his part, Branson maintains that the Virgin brand is so\nstrong internationally _ the company is already Britain's biggest\nadvertiser _ that his relatively late Internet move will not hurt\nhis chances. In fact, he said his timing might present an\nadvantage.\n\n   ``We have not lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Net in\nthe few years the Net was developing,'' he said, a not-so-veiled\nreference to companies like Amazon.com that have spent and lost\nlarge amounts of money building their clientele. ``Our approach is\nto come on the Net when the amount of people who are logging on to\nthe Net are considerable, and where we can actually see real\nprofits reasonably quickly.''\n\n   His remarks may be self-serving, but for Branson and his\nprivately held company, it is crucial to quickly turn a profit.\nOtherwise, he may find it necessary to relinquish some control over\nthe Virgin Group by raising money in the public stock market _ in\norder to compete for big-time capital with the likes of Amazon.\n\n   While he says that an initial public offering is on his mind, he\nhas no immediate plans for one, predicting that he can break into\nthe European Internet market without a major cash outlay for a\nbrand-building campaign. But the U.S. market is another matter.\n\n   ``In America we're well ahead in the major cities,'' he said,\nspeaking of Virgin's brand recognition. ``But out in the sticks,\nwe've still got some way to go. America will be the toughest nut to\ncrack. We will have to spend big bucks in America.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Unlike many of the Internet pioneers who have paid handsomely to\nsimply get their name out, Virgin already has dozens of branded\nproducts to help keep its name in the public eye. Branson said, for\nexample, that he intends to have ``Virgin.com'' painted onto the\nsides of his planes in place of the ``No Way BA/AA'' slogan that\nhas adorned Virgin's fleet since his nemesis, British Airways,\nannounced an abortive plan for a far-reaching alliance with\nAmerican Airlines.\n\n   Without the dot-com money of a publicly traded company, Branson\nseeks attention for himself and his company in ways beyond paid\nadvertising. Virgin generates press releases on an almost daily\nbasis, and he is not above publicity stunts like the Virgin Mobile\nrollout in November. Creating a stir widely chronicled in the\nBritish tabloids, he held a parade of sorts in the West End of\nLondon, riding a float on which he surrounded himself with nude\nmodels talking on Virgin Mobile phones. The slogan for the new\ncompany: ``What you see is what you get.''\n\n   He also primes the publicity pump by making himself freely\navailable for interviews. ``It's cheaper than buying a full-page ad\nin The New York Times,'' he joked.\n\n   Still, wielding his brand identity against Internet upstarts is\none thing. Taking on one of Europe's fasting-growing communications\npowers is another. And that is precisely the collision course he\nhas set for himself with Virgin Mobile, a joint venture with the\nDeutsche Telekom unit One2One. Despite its 300,000 subscribers in\nBritain, Virgin Mobile, will be up against the combined 42 million\nEuropean subscribers of Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, which\nannounced plans for the biggest industrial merger ever the week\nearlier this month.\n\n   Branson predicts that Virgin Mobile will be able to gain ground\non Vodafone when the licensing begins this spring for Britain's\nnext generation of wireless telephones _ digital devices that are\nto combine voice, Internet access and other digital features.\nToward that end, he has put together a group of investors that\ninclude the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the venture\ncapitalist George Soros.\n\n   But again, Branson may be a bit late, some contend. ``It's going\nto take Virgin years to build a network,'' Yasskin said. ``And by\nthe time they do, they will have missed the huge growth period.\nAnyway, the incumbents always have an advantage.''\n\n   Branson nonetheless says that he will be able to compete with\nestablished players like Vodafone. ``There is no reason we can't\noffer anything that Vodafone can,'' he said. ``We will by no means\nbe as big as them, but we will have a slice of the market.''\n\n   All of his businesses that have succeeded so far have done so by\ncarving out a niche in a mainstream industry by emphasizing service\nand style _ whether it be Virgin Atlantic, with its interactive\nmovie and game system in every seat in economy class, or Virgin\nBride, a one-stop shop for weddings.\n\n   Virgin's philosophy, Branson said, is to improve upon\nestablished businesses by adding a Virgin-esque sensibility.\n\n   With Virgin Mobile, for example, he is taking the unusual step\nof giving away an earpiece with a built-in microphone with each of\nthe company's mobile phones, so users do not have to hold them to\ntheir heads.\n\n   ``A friend of mine got a brain tumor, and before he died we had\ndinner and he said his surgeon was convinced that using a mobile\nphone may have been a factor,'' Branson said, raising a\nproduct-liability specter that the head of a public company might\nbe likely to suppress.\n\n   And the Virgin Web site will cater to Branson's digital naivete.\n``Any jargon that I don't understand'' will be stripped out, he\nsaid. ``I assume that I am representative of the vast majority of\nthe people out there.''\n\n   That thinking may explain why for Branson _ who in the past has\nattempted a solo, round-the-world balloon flight and who owns an\nisland in the Caribbean _ taking his business onto the Internet\ndoes not seem as as much fun as some of his previous endeavors.\n\n   ``It doesn't excite me in the same way that starting Virgin\nAtlantic did,'' he admitted. ``It's because I could deal with\npeople.
