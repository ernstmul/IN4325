(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By RONALD ROSENBERG  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   For all the cancer recoveries that Dr. Robert Amato has seen,\nfew have surprised and impressed him more than that of a\n50-year-old man who was successfully treated for kidney cancer,\nonly to see tumors spread to his lungs.\n\n   Amato, an oncologist and clinical investigator at the University\nof Texas's MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, gave the man eight\nweekly injections of an experimental cancer vaccine that was made,\nin part, from the patient's own cancer cells by Antigenics LLC, a\n5-year-old biotechnology company in Framingham, Mass.\n\n   Soon after the last injection, the tumors in his lungs began to\ndisappear, leaving just scars, which surgery subsequently removed.\nToday, 17 months after his first inoculation, the man is still\ncancer-free.\n\n   ``He was one of our first patients tested . . . and his tumors\nwere gone,'' Amato told Antigenics officials, cancer researchers,\nand investment bankers last month at the opening of the privately\nheld company's new $5.5 million biomanufacturing and research\nfacility in Woburn, Mass.\n\n   Amato's patient was among 38 who suffered a kidney cancer\nrelapse and participated in Antigenics' phase 1 safety trial to\ntest its custom-made vaccines using three different doses. Five\npatients have remained cancer-free and four have experienced\npartial recoveries, prompting the company to progress to a phase 2\ntrial that will use a single dose of the vaccines to more carefully\nmeasure recoveries.\n\n   The nine patients are part of a recent wave of promising\nclinical results for treating certain cancers using experimental _\nand controversial _ therapeutic vaccines derived, in part, from the\npatients' own cancerous tumors. Still in their infancy, these\npromising vaccines attack the abnormal proteins in cancer cells.\nAnd while these vaccines are still a tiny fraction of the $7.5\nbillion spent annually on cancer medications, some specialists see\nthem as potentially plausible alternatives to today's cancer drugs,\nmany of which have significant side effects.\n\n   Other medical researchers see promise in the vaccines because,\nthey say, cancerous tumors and melanomas are individually distinct,\nlike a fingerprint, making them difficult to identify and treat\nwith one single off-the-shelf drug.\n\n   ``The jury is still out on patient-specific vaccines, because\ncancer is not one disease but many, and there is evidence of some\npromising results today that we did not see a decade ago,'' said\nDr. Stanley Nathenson, professor of microbiology and immunology at\nNew York's Albert Einstein School of Medicine.\n\n   Still, none of the proposed vaccines is considered a possible\ncure. Instead, they are expected to help patients who have already\nundergone such standard anticancer procedures as surgery,\nradiation, and chemotherapy, but have suffered a relapse. They need\na treatment that has fewer side effects, yet is more effective in\nfighting cancer in older patients with weakened immune system.\n\n   Since early clinical testing of patient-specific vaccines began\ntwo years ago, none has been approved by the US Food and Drug\nAdministration. Several vaccine developers are hoping to launch\nmajor testing with hundreds of patients next year, with an eye\ntoward gaining FDA marketing clearance in 2002.\n\n   Even then, it will take about five years to assess the status of\npatients' recovery to sort out whether the new type of cancer\ntreatment is a long-term solution. Unlike preventive vaccines that\nward off polio or measles, that stimulate the immune system to\nprotect against invading infectious, therapeutic cancer vaccines go\nto work immediately battling diseased tumors and melanomas.\n\n   But despite their promising outlook, they are seen as merely a\ntemporary step on the road toward developing off-the-shelf vaccines\nthat will cost less and be available to treat a wider group of\ncancer patients.\n\n   ``The concept of these patient-specific vaccines goes back more\nthan 60 years,'' said Dennis Panicali, president of Therion\nBiologics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. company working with the\nNational Cancer Institute to develop seven therapeutic cancer\nvaccines that are not patient-specific. ``And while the scientific\nand physician community has taken notice, they are always saying,\n`If we can only make it little bit better.' ''\n\n   Genzyme, Antigenics, and several other companies think they have\nmade major strides with a new generation of vaccines. Antigenics,\nwhich reported an 80 percent cure rate in mice, is one of several\ncompanies developing patient-specific cancer vaccines that boost\nthe body's anticancer immune response.\n\n   Unlike many other proposed therapeutic cancer vaccines, which\nare made in laboratories, a patient-specific vaccine requires first\nharvesting a tumor biopsy, which is then packed in ice and shipped\novernight to a processing lab. Depending on the technology, the lab\ncreates the vaccine and sends it to the patient's physician, who\nover the course of three to eight weeks, injects it into the\npatient's skin.\n\n   These drugs are sometimes referred to as autologous vaccines,\nbecause they combine a patient's own cancer cells with a type of\nbacterium or other agent that provokes a major immune response.\n\n   ``We believe that our individualized cancer vaccines can be used\nto treat pancreatic, kidney, and skin cancers,'' said Garo Armen, a\ncofounder and president of Antigenics, which developed the\npersonalized cancer vaccines that Amato used in Houston. He said\nthe company's new Woburn facility can produce 7,000 individualized\nvaccines per year, at a cost to the patient of $15,000 per\ntreatment.\n\n   Antigenics has found a way to attack tumors using a class of\nproteins called heat-shock proteins, which when extracted from the\npatient's own tumors and purified, can be used to stimulate the\nimmune system to attack cancer cells.\n\n   Based on nearly 20 years of research by Pramod Srivastava, a\ncofounder of Antigenics and a cancer specialist at the University\nof Connecticut School of Medicine in Farmington, a patient's\nheat-shock proteins are extracted from the tumor, processed, and\nsent back in the form of a vaccine.\n\n   Armen, who hopes to gain FDA approval in three years, said the\ncost is comparable to standard chemotherapy, but still higher than\nsome newer cancer-fighting drugs such as Genentech Corp.'s breast\ncancer drug Herceptin.\n\n   Recently, Genzyme Molecular Oncology, a unit of Genzyme Corp. of\nCambridge, Mass., said it has tested two melanoma vaccines in a\nphase 1 product safety trial in more than 50 patients, with 20\npercent having ``dramatic clinical responses.''\n\n   In March, the company launched a phase 2 clinical trial of 24\npatients who have the most severe form of skin cancer, led by Dr.\nFrank G. Haluska of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer\nCenter. Patients will receive six injections over three months,\nwith the first results due next year.\n\n   At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, several clinical studies are\nunderway to test cancer vaccines from Cell Genesys Inc. of Foster\nCity, Calif.\n\n   ``The Boston area was the only place where we could get the\ntechnical expertise, the biotechnology researchers, and a major\nfacility for our needs,'' said Armen, who shuttles between\nAntigenics' Manhattan headquarters and the facilities in Woburn and\nFramingham.\n\n   Several other personalized vaccines are being tested around the\ncountry to treat lung, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancers.\nDendreon Corp. this fall expects to launch a pivotal clinical trial\nto test its dendritic cell therapy on men with late-stage prostate\ncancer.\n\n   The Seattle company harvests a patient's white blood cells and\nseparates out a component called dendritic cells, which are\nproduced by bone marrow to circulate throughout the body.\nConsidered the most powerful stimulator of immune responses in the\nbody, the patient's dendritic cells are cultured for two days with\nspecific cancer markers, or antigens, that are absorbed into the\ncells to produce a targeted response against prostate cancer.\n\n   In the company's longest study, 20 prostate cancer patients were\ntested and nearly half have not suffered a relapse in nearly a\nyear, according to David Urdal, Dendreon's chief scientific\nofficer.\n\n   And Avax Technologies of Kansas City recently launched a pivotal\nclinical trial for 400 patients with melanoma who have experienced\na relapse since their cancers were removed surgically. Melanoma is\nthe most serious form of skin cancer.\n\n   In April, the company reported that earlier testing of 40\npatients showed 17 still alive, of which 12 remain cancer free.\nAvax is projecting its patient-specific vaccine would cost about\n$20,000 per patient if it gains FDA approval, according to Ernest\nW. Yankee, Avax executive vice president. ``Right now, the large\npharmaceutical companies are not sure that this kind of vaccine\ntechnology is really practical,'' said Yankee.\n\n   Indeed, major drug companies would rather deliver\noff-the-pharmacy-shelf products that they can sell in large\nquantities to hospitals and health maintenance organizations.\nMaking small quantities of custom vaccines quickly and shipping\nthem across the country overnight raises concerns with the FDA over\nthe quality of each vaccine batch and whether it is consistent for\neach patient, said Denis R. Burger, president of AVI Biopharma Inc.\nof Portland, Ore., which is developing a laboratory-produced\ntherapeutic vaccine for colorectal cancer.\n\n   ``We know our cost of goods is $100, which means we can charge\nunder $1,000, so once we get real conventional therapeutic vaccines\napproved, autologous vaccines are out the window,'' said Burger.\n\n   Nonpatient-specific vaccines like those made by Therion\nBiologics and AVI Biopharma are attracting pharmaceutical company\ninterest.\n\n   Last fall, SmithKline Beecham PLC, one of the largest vaccine\nmakers in the world, expanded its strategic partnership with Corixa\nCorp. of Seattle, a 5-year-old developer of vaccines for cancer and\ntuberculosis, to include therapeutic vaccines for ovarian and colon\ncancers.\n\n   But some oncologists, such as Nathenson at Einstein, say that\nany drug that is effective and less toxic than some current\nmedications is worthwhile.\n\n   ``If these patient-specific vaccines are approved, they will\nmeet an unmet medical need of prolonging survival with a better\nquality of life,'' said Dr. Mark A. Goldberg, an associate\nprofessor at the Harvard Medical School and vice president of\nmedical affairs at Genzyme Molecular Oncology. ``But the long-term\ngoal is to develop off-the-shelf vaccines.''\n","Headline":"\nEXPERIMENTAL PATIENT-SPECIFIC CANCER VACCINES SHOW PROMISE \n","Text":["\n   For all the cancer recoveries that Dr. Robert Amato has seen,\nfew have surprised and impressed him more than that of a\n50-year-old man who was successfully treated for kidney cancer,\nonly to see tumors spread to his lungs.\n","\n   Amato, an oncologist and clinical investigator at the University\nof Texas's MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, gave the man eight\nweekly injections of an experimental cancer vaccine that was made,\nin part, from the patient's own cancer cells by Antigenics LLC, a\n5-year-old biotechnology company in Framingham, Mass.\n","\n   Soon after the last injection, the tumors in his lungs began to\ndisappear, leaving just scars, which surgery subsequently removed.\nToday, 17 months after his first inoculation, the man is still\ncancer-free.\n","\n   ``He was one of our first patients tested . . . and his tumors\nwere gone,'' Amato told Antigenics officials, cancer researchers,\nand investment bankers last month at the opening of the privately\nheld company's new $5.5 million biomanufacturing and research\nfacility in Woburn, Mass.\n","\n   Amato's patient was among 38 who suffered a kidney cancer\nrelapse and participated in Antigenics' phase 1 safety trial to\ntest its custom-made vaccines using three different doses.
