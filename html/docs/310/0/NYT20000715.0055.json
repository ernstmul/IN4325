Second Sight President Dr. Robert\nGreenberg said such use of his implant is a ``when'' rather than an\n``if'' proposition now that a key threshold _ wireless transmission\nof images to the retina _ appears to have been crossed.\n\n   ``What we'd like to be able to do is send patients home with\nthese devices,'' Greenberg said.\n\n   If key problems are solved, researchers estimate that implants\ncould be available to the general public within a decade. The\npotential market for Second Sight's retinal implant, which works on\nthe same basic principle as a television, could number as high as\n20 million, the estimate of how many people worldwide have\ndegenerative retinal diseases.\n\n   Dr. Gerald Loeb, director of the Medical Devices Development\nFacility at the University of Southern California, thinks Second\nSight and its collaborators stand the best chance of success among\nresearch groups attempting retinal implants. The size of the eye\nand its delicacy, however, makes Loeb think that implants directly\nonto the brain's visual cortex _ also under research _ stand a\nbetter chance.\n\n   Then again, Loeb said, people said cochlear implants would never\nhelp deaf people hear, an successful invention he helped create 20\nyears ago.\n\n   ``If you're going into the eye, the way they're doing it is the\nright way in my opinion,'' he said.\n\n   Even though the artificial sight might never become as good as\nthe real thing, some of the 20-odd people who have had basic sight\nrestored for mere hours have signed up to be experiment subjects\nagain and again.\n\n   Harold Churchey, a 72-year-old Sharpsburg, Md., resident has\nundergone three implant surgeries since 1992. Retinitis pigmentosa\nhas stolen all of what little sight he had to begin with as a\nchild.\n\n   ``About the only way I know the sun is shining is I feel the\nheat,'' said Churchey, who ran a snack bar in a state physical\nrehabilitation center for 33 years before retiring in 1996.\n\n   In the first experiment, he saw a burst of light. In the third\nsurgery, four years later at Johns Hopkins University, he was able\nto make out the letter H after electrodes in that shape were\nstimulated. He called the experience a blessing and said if\nresearchers want him for a fourth try, he's ready to go.\n\n   ``I have a routine but I'd be happy to change that routine if I\ncould see,'' he said.\n\n   Retinal disease foundations are as excited as Churchey. Tom\nHoglund, spokesman for the Foundation Fighting Blindness in\nsuburban Baltimore, said implants' potential to at least allow\npeople to function without seeing-eye dogs is ``in itself just\nfantastic.''\n\n   ``We've been watching this field grow immeasurably,'' Hoglund\nsaid. ``There's clearly commercial interest in developing this and\nwhen there is, that shows that somebody believes there is a viable\nproduct out there.''\n\n   In the case of 18-month-old Second Sight, the commercial\ninterest has come from local high-tech inventor and financier Al\nMann, whose other ventures include insulin pump maker MiniMed and\ncochlear implant maker Advanced Bionics. Mann leads a trio of\ninvestors interested in commercial results.\n\n   ``Universities don't always have the same objectives, the same\nmethods,'' he said. ``They don't really know how to make\nproducts.''\n\n   Eye researchers have pursued artificial vision through devices\nlike Second Sight's for 20 years, borrowing ideas from the first\ncochlear implants that restored hearing in deaf patients. The eye\nimplant Greenberg envisions would include a camera mounted on a\npair of glasses. It would break down images like pixels on a\ntelevision screen and transmit them to a panel of electrodes\npositioned over the retina.\n\n   To date, human recipients have had a power source attached to an\nelectrode array by a wire that protrudes from the sclera, or white\nof the eye. The exposed wire would make the device too hazardous\nfor everyday use. And the best resolution researchers have been\nable to produce allowed patients to distinguish letters on stark\nbackgrounds like Churchey's H, but no more.\n\n   So far, researchers have made an electrode panel that produces a\nmere 25 pixels of sight, compared with about 300,000 that make up\nimages on a basic computer screen. Imagine everything in your field\nof view limited to 25 blocks, each filled with a blob of a single\ncolor.\n\n   Regardless of the slow process, problems that might have taken\nseveral decades to solve have already been overcome. Greenberg\ncredits an infusion of cash by Mann and other investors for the\ncreation of a new prototype _ one without dangerous wires\nprotruding through the eye.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)\n\n   The company, situated in a suburban Santa Clarita business\ncomplex that lies in the shadow of the Magic Mountain amusement\npark, joins at least three other research groups in the United\nStates and Germany attempting to make various implants work. There\nis a faint atmosphere of espionage as players try to guess if there\nare still more competitors and closely guard data about their own\nproducts.\n\n   Greenberg covered up chalkboards full of calculations as he\ntalked to a reporter in his office last week. He would not say when\nexactly the wireless implant was developed, but it was sometime\nthis year and has been fitted in an animal. The device transmits\nthe signal via radio waves, the glasses-mounted camera being the\ntelevision station beaming images to the TV set that is the\nimplant.\n\n   The device's safety is tested first, then its effectiveness. A\nclinical trial for humans would be next.\n\n   It's in the nature of experiments to have downsides and the\nimplants are no exception.\n\n   Early on, researchers decided that people who have never had\nsight before do not make the best candidates. Greenberg recounts\nthe story of an early experiment, in which an implant recipient was\ndisturbed by the strange bursts which his brain had never had\nreason to comprehend before.\n\n   ``It was as if he had ESP,'' Greenberg said.\n\n   And there are several problems to be resolved before the\npreviously sighted can have some vision restored. Greenberg hopes\nto be able to make a 33-by-33-electrode array so recipients can\nimprove resolution but the means must be found to fit more\nelectrodes on the same 2-by-3 millimeter panel.\n\n   Beyond that, implant chips, being electronic, could pose a\nhazard to surrounding eye tissue by the heat they produce. They\nalso need a place in the inner eye on which to anchor. Greenberg,\nwhose company announced a formal research collaboration with five\nuniversities at the end of June, has yet to figure out how to keep\nit from floating around in the fluid-filled center of the eye.\n\n   But Greenberg said a study not yet published will show that the\nheat generated is not sufficient to cause damage and that the\ncollaboration is exploring methods such as tacking the implant onto\nthe surface of the retina.\n\n   ``We've assembled the best and brightest minds to work on these\nproblems,'' Greenberg said. ``There are thousands of patients who\nhave no hope of vision by any other means.''\n\n   X X X\n","Headline":"\nIMPLANTS COULD RESTORE SIGHT\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ Encroaching on the domain of miracles, a\nbiotechnology firm hopes to restore long-term vision to blind\npeople as early as next year.\n","\n   The name of the company, Second Sight, extends a promise made\nwhen the first blind patients reported _ with a mix of elation and\nconfusion _ seeing basic shapes during university experiments nine\nyears ago.\n","\n   Now the company joins a small field of competitors racing to be\nthe first to create replacements for damaged retinas that are\nsuitable for widespread use.
