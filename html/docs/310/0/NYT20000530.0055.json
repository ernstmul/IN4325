Times News Service clients)  \n (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the \nCasper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First\nAmendment commentary. His e-mail address is\nlevendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) \n By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Suppose\nyou were arrested and charged with a serious crime, but the\nprosecutor refused to tell you or your attorney the nature of the\ncrime or the evidence against you. Doing so, according to the\nprosecutor, would jeopardize national security. You don't know who\nyour accusers are; you don't even know the accusation against you.\n\n   Sound crazy? Such Kafkaesque scenes are occurring in our nation\nright now _ in the United States, not some South American\ndictatorship.\n\n   Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct in 1996. It authorized the setting up of special Immigration\nand Naturalization Service courts and the use of classified or\nsecret evidence against an accused that he and his attorney cannot\nview. Only the special court judge can.\n\n   The INS has used secret evidence in 75 cases against\nnon-citizens. There are currently 25 cases pending in INS special\ncourts which rely upon secret evidence.\n\n   Most of those accused using secret evidence are Arabs or Muslims\n_ a kind of government-sanctioned racism.\n\n   In any criminal trial in the United States, no matter how\nserious the crime, a defendant has the right to see all the\nevidence against him.\n\n   Classified or secret evidence was not even permitted in the\ntrials of the bombers of the Oklahoma City federal building and New\nYork City's World Trade Center.\n\n   Use of secret evidence that the accused cannot confront or\ndispute is against our nation's sense of justice and our\nConstitution. Secret evidence, which cannot be balanced against\ncounter evidence, perpetuates a sham justice. It denies defendants,\nwho are the targets of that secret evidence, due process of law.\n\n   The Fifth Amendment states unequivocally: ``No person shall be\n... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\nlaw.''\n\n   Notice that the Fifth Amendment does not say ``No United States\ncitizen shall be ... .'' It says ``No person.'' That means\nnon-citizens also have the protection of the Fifth Amendment's due\nprocess clause.\n\n   But not according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,\nnor according to the anti-terrorism act. That act gave the agency\nthe power to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens on the basis of\nsecret evidence. Any non-citizens arrested by the INS can be denied\nan opportunity to even confront the government's witnesses against\nthem or be told who they are.\n\n   A few of those arrested non-citizens have spent as long as three\nyears in prison awaiting the final outcome of their cases. And when\ntheir cases were finally taken out of the special INS courts and\ninto federal courts through appeals, the INS lost both on the\nconstitutional issue of denial of due process and on the flimsy\nnature of the evidence presented against those accused.\n\n   And strangely, although the INS could have appealed these cases\n_ involving potential terrorists, according to the agency _ it did\nnot.\n\n   Perhaps even the agency could see their accusations were based\nupon flimsy evidence.\n\n   In testimony before Congress, both the FBI and the INS claimed\nthat secret evidence used in all cases is ``substantive and\ncredible'' and ``is subjected to rigorous review.'' However,\nneither the federal courts, nor even some INS special court judges,\nwho have the right to review the secret evidence, have found that\nto be true. Most of this secret evidence turned out to be\ninflammatory gossip and hearsay by those who had grudges against\nthe accused.\n\n   Hany Kiareldeen was born in Gaza. He came to the United States\nin 1990 to attend college. He was arrested in 1998 and accused of\nterrorist activities, based upon a false accusation by his ex-wife.\nHe spent 19 months in prison before being released. The so-called\nevidence against Kiareldeen was his former wife's accusation.\n\n   Mazen Al-Najjar, of Palestinian descent, has been in an INS\nprison for three years. He taught at the University of South\nFlorida until he was arrested. He now faces what appears to be an\nindefinite sentence. No criminal charges have been made against\nhim. And Al-Najjar cannot view the evidence against him.\n\n   Nasser Ahmed, from Egypt, spent more than three years in an INS\nprison, most of it in solitary confinement, before his release last\nNovember when the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that he did\nnot pose a threat to national security. The secret evidence against\nhim was a sham.\n\n   Last year, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., introduced the Secret\nEvidence Repeal Act (HR 2121) to end this abomination against the\nconstitutional rule of law. The legislation now has 90 co-sponsors\nin the House.\n\n   The act would strike down the use of special courts and secret\nevidence against non-citizens. The proposed legislation states in\npart: ``The alien shall have reasonable opportunity to examine all\nthe evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's\nown behalf, and to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the\nGovernment.''\n\n   Last week, the House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on\nHR 2121. At that hearing, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., a co-sponsor\nof the bill, made it clear in his testimony that HR 2121 ``would\nnot require the government to release dangerous terrorists. It\nmerely requires the government to choose whether to reveal the\nevidence against a non-citizen whose liberty is in jeopardy, or\nkeep that information fully secret and outside immigration\nproceedings and determinations.''\n\n   David Cole, professor of law at Georgetown University Law\nCenter, testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He has had\nlong experience dealing with the INS and secret testimony. He\ndefended 13 Palestinians against INS charges that they posed a\nthreat to national security.\n\n   Cole said in his testimony: ``But it is not simply years of\nhuman beings' lives that have been lost. More broadly, America's\nimage as a country that cares about fairness, openness, and due\nprocess has been seriously tarnished. Secret evidence is a tactic\none associates with totalitarian regimes and military juntas, not\nfree democracies. A remedy is needed, and HR 2121 is it.''\n\n   The damage, however, isn't only to our nation's image. The use\nof secret evidence poses a significant threat to constitutional\nconstraints. If the anti-terrorism act can carve out an exception\nto the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, what other\nexceptions will be carved out during times of perceived danger?\n\n   Congress should pass the Secret Evidence Repeal Act.\n\n   We cannot protect America by hacking apart our Constitution. If\nwe attempt to do so, we're in danger of becoming the despotic enemy\nwe so despise.\n\n     \nNYT-05-29-00 1518EDT  \n","Headline":"\nTIME TO SLAM THE DOOR ON SECRET EVIDENCE \n","Text":["\n   Sound crazy?
