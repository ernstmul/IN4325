And mom and dad can\nsidetrack their kids from bickering in the back seats by flicking\non a video (or DVD) of ``The Matrix'' on the new theater systems\ndesigned for cars.\n\n   Car stereos are no longer just car stereos.\n\n   ``My first car didn't even have a radio,'' said James Armstrong\nof Point        Roberts, Wash., as he checked out a special GMC Yukon\nsport utility vehicle decked out with about $2,500 worth of JVC\naudio and video electronics. The gear included a DVD player,\ncomputer navigation system, two independent video screens for the\nrear seats, two headphones for the passengers and booming 12-inch\nsubwoofers for the driver and anyone else standing within earshot\nof the vehicle.\n\n   To judge by some of the exhibits at the annual electronics\nextravaganza in Las Vegas, auto dealers may soon start using more\nmegahertz instead of more horsepower to sell cars.\n\n   Computer chips are already in use throughout even the average\nsedan in everything from engine controls to stereo systems. But\nnow, electronics companies are bringing the Web to cars.\n\n   Motorola, Clarion Corp. and Ford Motor Co. unit Visteon\nAutomotive Systems all unveiled new in-dash or dash-mounted car\ncomputers that they hope to start shipping later this year. Each\noffers a wider range of services than the standard AM-FM cassette\ndeck, to put it mildly.\n\n   For example, Motorola's iRadio, with models costing between $500\nand $1,000, combines digital cellular phone service, satellite\nlinks and the Internet to allow drivers to download traffic reports\non demand, instead of having to wait until an on-the-air radio\nstation broadcasts them.\n\n   A driver also can get e-mail, updated stock quotes, tune in 100\ndifferent radio stations delivered by satellites, download\nMP3-formatted digital music and find the nearest McDonald's or dry\ncleaner.\n\n   This week, Motorola announced a partnership with Redwood City\nstartup Command Audio Inc., which is trying to sell a subscription\nservice for drivers to download audio versions of written news,\nsports and information from sources like Time magazine and the Wall\nStreet Journal.\n\n   Command Audio, which also markets a handheld receiver made by\nRCA, initiated the service last month in Denver and Phoenix,\nalthough it may not reach its own home market until 2001.\n\n   But chief executive Don Bogue believes interest in the\n$15-per-month Command Audio subscriptions will accelerate because\nboth motorists and mass transit riders want to make better use of\ntheir travel time.\n\n   ``We think there's a great opportunity in addressing the market\nfor mobile consumers,'' Bogue said. ``For all consumers, there is\njust an explosive amount of media, but just less and less time to\nconsume it. They don't have time to read a daily newspaper\nanymore.''\n\n   Like the iRadio, Visteon's ICES, which stands for Information,\nCommunication, Entertainment and Security, is linked to a Web site\nso a driver can personalize a selection of entertainment and data.\nThe voice-activated ICES may be out in the second quarter of 2000.\n\n   Lori Markatos, Visteon's multimedia and electronic systems\nsupervisor, conceded the initial $3,200 cost of a ``fully\ninstalled'' ICES will initially turn off the average car buyer.\n\n   ``The price point has got to come down to $500, but it can in\ntime with (sales) volume,'' Markatos said. That may happen by 2003,\nespecially as more car computer systems are sold overall, she said.\n\n   Clarion Corp., showed off the ``concept'' of its\nsecond-generation AutoPC, which can play MP3 music and run two\nvideo screens for rear-seat passengers to view DVD movies and video\ngames.\n\n   Jukka Rissanen, a Clarion marketing specialist, said the company\nhasn't released the sales numbers for its first-generation AutoPC,\nwhich went on the market last year. But he said the newer model\nmight be ready for sale in the fall at about the same price,\n$1,600.\n\n   Speaking of MP3, the popular audio format used to compress songs\ndownloaded from the Internet, Atlanta's i2go.com introduced its eGo\nplayer. The $270 device not only plays MP3 music through a car\nstereo, but can compress e-mail messages into an MP3 format and\nread back the text in a synthesized human voice.\n\n   Consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. is also trying to fill\ndrive time, in particular, the commute hours of trendy digital-age\nGenerationY youth.\n\n   Sony Electronics Inc. unleashed several new car products under\nits year-old Xplod brand, including an AM-FM stereo that can record\nsongs onto a MiniDisc.\n\n   The MD Record, due to hit the U.S. market in March at a retail\nprice of $699, allows drivers to record tracks from their CDs,\nusing an optional CD changer, or from the radio.\n\n   It has a 10-second memory so users can record songs or programs\noff the radio even after they started. An included timer can record\nup to 80 minutes worth of a programming after the driver leaves the\ncar.\n\n   Even people too busy to record their favorite songs at home,\n``have some time in the car,'' said Romeo Hakusui, a senior vice\npresident for Sony's mobile communications division.\n\n   The era of the drive-in theater may be dead, but electronics\nmanufacturers are trying to create a new drive-on theater\nphenomenon. At CES, there were a slew of products to turn that car\nor SUV into a rolling entertainment unit, including new car DVD\nvideo players from Sony and Panasonic.\n\n   There were also kits like the $700 Back Seat Theater from TMI\nProducts Inc. of Corona (Riverside County).\n\n   And if anyone is worried about all that expensive equipment\nluring thieves, Clifford Electronics of Southern California offered\na new car security system that can be controlled remotely through\nthe Web.\n\n   The makers of these smart car devices said their ease of use and\noften hands-free operation should make them safe to operate while\ndriving. Yet there is already a national debate about whether the\nuse of cell phones in cars is safe, although attempts to ban their\nuse have failed except in one Midwest town. A New England Journal\nof Medicine study showed drivers using cell phone were 34 percent\nmore likely to have an accident than drivers without cell phones.\n\n   Bob Harrington, communications director with the nonprofit\nNational Safety Council, was concerned the new car devices\nintroduced in Las Vegas also will take drivers' eyes and minds off\nthe roads if not used with proper precautions.\n\n   ``It doesn't matter if it's hands-free,'' said Harrington. ``If\nyou bought technology stocks on Monday, you wouldn't be feeling\ngood about it today, so as you're making your expletive-deleted\ncomments, you have to be aware that does add to the risks that\nyou're going to hit something.''\n\n   And he noted motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of\ndeath for people age 25 and under. ``They're targeting a market\nthat needs to pay attention to driving the most,'' Harrington said.\n\n     \n   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)     \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   But at the Consumer Electronics Show this week, big companies\nsuch as Motorola and Sony joined with startups like Command Audio\nto unveil new computer-controlled, voice-activated, Web-attached\nautomobile gizmos designed to fill those wasted commute hours with\nproductivity, not to mention distractions.\n","\n   Drivers soon will be able to download spoken versions of their\ne-mail, the latest stock quotes or stories from the Wall Street\nJournal while they're waiting to get past the morning mess at the\nBay Bridge toll plaza.\n","\n   Or they can use the time to record their favorite music from\ntheir CD collections or MP3-formatted songs downloaded off the\nInternet while negotiating Hospital Curve.
