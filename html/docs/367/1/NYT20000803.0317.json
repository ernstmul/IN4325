Freed in the ship's\ncapture were three Canadian soldiers assigned to guard the\nequipment being returned from peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.\n\n   The ship's captain, Vitaly Khlebnikov, in a bid to thwart the\nlanding, ``violently maneuvered'' the Katie and radioed\ninternational distress signals, said Navy Captain Drew Robertson,\ncommander of the Athabaskan and operational head of the boarding\nmission.\n\n   ``The Sea King pilot held rock steady and the team was able to\ngain control of the vessel within 45 or 50 minutes,'' Robertson\nsaid from the Canadian warship. ``The captain was quite theatrical\nin his objections, but otherwise there was no resistance.''\n\n   The Katie was seized in international waters outside Canada's\nmaritime jurisdiction. Khlebnikov accused Canada of acting\nrecklessly.\n\n   ``It's very, very dangerous what they do,'' he said by satellite\nphone as a Canadian helicopter swooped over the stern. ``We have\n500 tons of explosives aboard and my crew is placed in danger by\nthese Canadians.''\n\n   But Canadian officials said the government had no choice but to\nact, especially given that the ``hijacked'' cargo included\nhighly-sophisticated electronics surveillance gear and other\nsensitive weaponry.\n\n   ``Being held hostage, having our equipment held hostage, was\nsimply unacceptable,'' Defense Minister Art Eggleton told reporters\nin Ottawa shortly after the 1:45 p.m. boarding of the cargo ship.\n``In the end we had no choice but to take the military option.''\n\n   Thursday night, the freighter that so stubbornly refused to head\nfor harbor was steaming across the Gulf of St. Lawrence under close\nescort by Canadian warships, bound for a port near Montreal. The\nKatie's captain remained at the helm, but course and speed of the\nfreighter were directed by the Canadian military and the vessel was\nexpected to dock at Becancouer, Quebec, on Sunday.\n\n   The United States raised no objection to the capture of the\nAmerican-owned vessel since the Katie flies under a flag of\nconvenience, registered in the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Vincent\nand Grenadines, and thus is not entitled to US protection in a\ncommercial dispute. The 23 crew members of the Soviet-built ship\nare Ukranians, Russians and Croats.\n\n   ``This is a private shipping company and there is no US military\ninvolvement,'' said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.\n\n   The US Embassy in Ottawa said Washington had been given\nassurance that St. Vincent and the Grenadines approved Canada's\nplan to board the vessel.\n\n   Canada acted after being held up to international ridicule for\nits reluctance to rescue its military equipment.\n\n   ``We've been made to look fairly ridiculous,'' said retired Col.\nBrian MacDonald, a Canadian military analyst. ``It's low comedy _\nthe country that can't defend the very equipment upon which it\ndepends for national defense.''\n\n   What started as a business bluff by Third Ocean Marine\nNavigation Co. of Annapolis, Md. _ owner of the Katie _ had by this\nweek escalated into a tense showdown involving shipping companies,\nthe US State Department, the government of St. Vincent and the\nGrenadines, and legions of Canadian military personnel, diplomats,\njustice ministry lawyers and international commerce officials.\n\n   The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, after two weeks\nof more or less shrugging off the situation, finally slipped into\ncrisis mode as the standoff turned into a national embarrassment.\n\n   But the American owners of the Katie refused instructions to\nhead to port even after Canadian warships arrived on the scene.\n\n   In the end, it took three Canadian warships, an Aurora\nsurveillance aircraft, helicopters, and, finally, the naval\nboarding party to bring the Katie to bay. Before the raid the\n750-foot freighter, with its unarmed crew, was shadowed by a trio\nof Canadian warships, including the Athabaskan and frigates HMCS\nMontreal and HMCS Ville de Quebec.\n\n   The standoff began on July 18, two days after the Katie was\nscheduled to arrive in Becancour, Quebec, to begin unloading the\ncargo of 580 armored vehicles and sea container packed with weapons\nand more than 500 tons of ammunition. The estimated value of the\ncargo is approximately $200 million.\n\n   Instead, the Katie, one of the largest and fastest ships in the\nworld, started tracing giant circles in the fog-shrouded North\nAtlantic, refusing to enter Canadian waters for fear, according to\nits owner, that the ship would be confiscated in a complicated\nfinancial wrangle with the Canadian firms that acted as\nsubcontractors for the military.\n\n   J.P. ``Flip'' Walters, chief executive for Third Ocean, said the\ncompany was caught between debt and the deep blue sea, with\ncreditors poised to seize the ship the instant it docked in\nMontreal because of payments owed not by Third Ocean itself but\nCanadian shipping firms that subcontracted the ship.\n\n   ``There are two victims here, the Canadian government and Third\nOcean,'' Walters said. ``We're not pirates, we are not hijackers,\nwe're a reputable company that has transported (equipment for) the\nBritish Army, the German Army and the US Navy.''\n\n   He added: ``If this was cotton bales or Toyotas, we could head\nto France or somewhere and auction off the cargo'' to satisfy the\ndebts apparently owed Third Ocean by a Montreal shipping firm,\nAndromeda Navigation. ``But since the cargo belongs to Her\nMajesty's Canadian Forces, we're in a desperate spot.''\n\n   Canada once boasted one of the most formidable navies in the\nworld, but massive budget cuts over the past decade have\ndrastically reduced the NATO member's military power.\n\n   The country is still an enthusiastic participant in UN\npeacekeeping operations, but it no longer possesses the heavylift\nships or cargo aircraft to carry its troops to foreign trouble\nspots, so it relies on hired civilian vessels, such as the Katie.\n\n   Defense Minister Eggleton announced that the Canadian government\nis now considering building a fleet of military transport vessels.\n","Headline":"\nCOMMANDOS SEIZE ROGUE FREIGHTER LOADED WITH MUNITIONS \n","Text":["\n   MONTREAL _ Helicopter-borne Canadian Navy commandos Thursday\nstormed and seized of a rogue American superfreighter in waters\nsouth of Newfoundland, ending a 2 1/2-week high-seas standoff in\nwhich the GTS Katie held hostage a cargo of fighting vehicles,\ntroop carriers, and other war gear representing 10 percent of\nCanada's armored might.\n","\n   There were no casualties as the 14-member boarding force\nrappelled onto the pitching upper deck from a Sea King helicopter\nlaunched from the destroyer HMCS Athabaskan.
