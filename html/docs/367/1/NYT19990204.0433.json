Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Yasser Arafat, partners in\nthe Middle East peace process and high-voltage generators of\ncontroversy, appeared Thursday at an ecumenical prayer breakfast,\ntesting the faith and charity of hundreds of guests.\n\n   Even though Arafat did not speak, his attendance for the first\ntime at the annual National Prayer Breakfast touched off a boycott\nby some religious groups and members of Congress, who said that he\nwas not fit to appear at such a gathering because of his suspected\nsponsorship of terrorism.\n\n   Clinton was received more politely than Arafat by those at the\nbreakfast, some of whom have publicly condemned the sexual behavior\nand deceptive statements that led to his impeachment and trial.\nSen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who has been one of the\nharshest Democratic critics of the president's conduct, asked God\nto hear Clinton's pleas for forgiveness.\n\n   Lieberman said, ``Lord, may I say a special prayer at this time\nof difficulty for our president, that you would hear his prayers,\nthat you help him with the work he's doing with his family and his\nclergy, that you accept his atonement.''\n\n   Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a conservative Republican who\nheaded this year's prayer breakfast and who voted in December to\nimpeach Clinton, said that he seldom agreed with the president on\nmatters of politics and policy. But he said that did not affect his\nspirit of Christian brotherhood.\n\n   ``Mr. President,'' Largent said, ``I may not have voted with you\nin the four years I've been in Congress, but I want you to know\nthat I care for you and love you and that's part of the mystery of\nJesus.''\n\n   In his brief remarks, Clinton made no mention of his personal or\npolitical troubles, delivering a high-minded appeal for peace and\nreconciliation around the world.\n\n   Clinton, in his public remarks and later in private, thanked\nArafat for his efforts toward peace with Israel. The president said\nthat peace is not made among friends, but between enemies, and\nrequires a willingness to put aside historical grievances and\npersonal slights. He also paid tribute to Leah Rabin, the widow of\nthe slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. She also attended\nThursday's prayer session.\n\n   ``I ask you to pray for all of us, including yourself,'' Clinton\nsaid to the 2,600 people who attended the breakfast in the ballroom\nof the Washington Hilton, ``to pray that our purpose truly will\nreflect God's will; to pray that we can all be purged of the\ntemptation to pretend that our willfulness is somehow equal to\nGod's will; to remember that all the great peacemakers in the world\nin the end have to let go and walk away, like Christ, not from\napparent but from genuine grievances.''\n\n   Clinton met privately with Arafat for 20 minutes after the\nbreakfast to discuss the status of the Middle East peace process.\nClinton also met briefly with Mrs. Rabin.\n\n   Several members of Congress who customarily attend the prayer\nbreakfast, which is sponsored by Congress and has been held\nannually since 1942, sat out this year's event to protest Arafat's\nappearance.\n\n   Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., said that it was inappropriate to\ninvite Arafat to such a gathering.\n\n   ``I am very much offended by the presence of Yasser Arafat, who\nis a man who has American blood on his hands,'' Forbes said, citing\nsuspected Palestinian involvement in terrorist acts that killed\nAmerican citizens, including the murder of Leon Klinghoffer aboard\nthe cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985.\n\n   But Largent said that he was not making a political statement by\nincluding Arafat. He said that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli\nprime minister, had also been invited but declined because of\nscheduling problems.\n\n   ``This is precisely the type of event that people like Arafat\nought to be invited to,'' Largent said. ``The idea of a prayer\nbreakfast is to bring people together for reconciliation and\nhealing and forgiveness and talk about those issues that Jesus\ntaught.''\n","Headline":"\nCLINTON AND ARAFAT APPEAR AT ANNUAL PRAYER BREAKFAST \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Yasser Arafat, partners in\nthe Middle East peace process and high-voltage generators of\ncontroversy, appeared Thursday at an ecumenical prayer breakfast,\ntesting the faith and charity of hundreds of guests.\n","\n   Even though Arafat did not speak, his attendance for the first\ntime at the annual National Prayer Breakfast touched off a boycott\nby some religious groups and members of Congress, who said that he\nwas not fit to appear at such a gathering because of his suspected\nsponsorship of terrorism.\n","\n   Clinton was received more politely than Arafat by those at the\nbreakfast, some of whom have publicly condemned the sexual behavior\nand deceptive statements that led to his impeachment and trial.\nSen.
