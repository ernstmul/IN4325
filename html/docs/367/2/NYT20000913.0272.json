(Circuits)  \n By JENNIFER 8. LEE   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   David Alpert, president of an Internet startup called\nMarketingInfo, admits that he is addicted to remote controls. He\nestimates that the members of his gadget-oriented family have\naccumulated about 55 remote controls over the years around their\nhouse in Old Westbury, N.Y. There was one for the air-conditioning,\none for the lights. They needed five remote controls to watch a\nmovie and 12 to listen to the stereo, with separate controls for\ncomponents like the subwoofers and the equalizer.\n\n   ``At a certain point,'' Alpert said, ``the extra features stop\nbeing convenient and become overwhelming. It's not worth it.\nRemotes are supposed to simplify things.''\n\n   In its 50th year, the remote control population outnumbers the\nhuman population in the United States. Households often have more\nremote controls than they have family members. Alpert's family of\nfour, for example, keeps a basket of a dozen or so old remote\ncontrols. ``I don't know what they do,'' Alpert said. ``They're\nlike Gremlins. You get them wet, and they multiply.''\n\n   The average household now has more than four remote controls,\naccording to the Consumer Electronics Association. Most of these\noperate televisions and stereos, but remote controls have expanded\ntheir domain into other areas of the house. They are now available\nfor fireplaces, ceiling fans, air-conditioning, house lights and\nwindow blinds. They have hopped out of the house and into the car,\nand even onto the Internet. For people who find using a mouse too\nonerous, PlanetPortal is introducing the WebRemote Control, which\nbrowses through Web sites with a touch of a button.\n\n   Rising from this landscape awash with remote controls are\nsupergadgets, the universal remote controls that have emerged in\nthe last three years. The latest high-end universal remote controls\nare sleek. They are chic. They have LCD touch screens. They can\ntalk to personal computers. And they can cost several hundred\ndollars apiece. In short, they are more akin to personal digital\nassistants than to the clunky black rubber-button remotes of yore.\n\n   These remote controls can take one to two hours to set up, often\nwith software on a PC. They can also learn directly from other\nremotes by reading their infrared signals.\n\n   Alpert found his salvation in a touch-screen universal remote\ncontrol. Sleek and black, it put all his controls in one place.\n``It was awesome,'' Alpert said. ``There was everything right in\nfront of you, including lights, air-conditioning, TV, VCR _\neverything in just one touch of the screen. Life was good.''\n\n   Among the off-the-shelf universal remotes with touch-screen LCD\ndisplays on the market are the Pronto from Philips Electronics, the\nTake Control TC1000 from Harman Kardon and the RM-AV2100 control\nfrom Sony. Universal Remote Control says its Home Theater Master\nMX-1000 will be on the market by the end of this month. The Pronto\nand the Take Control let users use their PC software to design LCD\ninterfaces with their own virtual buttons.\n\n   While the hefty price tags _ about $130 to $400 _ may raise\neyebrows, buyers who have spent thousands of dollars on home\nentertainment systems may not balk at paying that much for a single\ndevice that can run everything.\n\n   Rob Trueman, who runs a software consulting firm outside\nPhiladelphia, recently paid $300 for a Philips Pronto touch-screen\nuniversal remote to replace the 10 remote controls he had in his\nhouse. ``It definitely makes it much, much easier,'' he said. ``I'm\nnot constantly searching for the right remote.'' The old remote\ncontrols are now relegated to a drawer under the couch. ``They are\npretty much happy because they are under the sofa, where they tend\nto go anyway,'' he said.\n\n   His new universal control has been programmed to start DVD\nmovies at a touch of a button. ``It's even less of a reason to get\nup,'' Trueman said. ``If the remote control could bring me a beer,\nthat would be it.'' The remote control might not be able to deliver\nbeer quite yet, but it can fetch pizza. In Honolulu, viewers can\nuse the remote control to order from Pizza Hut through a service\nprovided by PowerTV.\n\n   If the remote control visionaries are to be believed, these\ntouch-screen remote controls may one day be integrated with PDAs.\n(Is there anything that the PDA isn't going to merge with?) Each\nperson could carry around a personalized remote control that could\nbe updated with software from the Internet.\n\n   Perhaps the convergence is already starting. People can use\nsoftware to transform Palm and Visor PDAs with infrared\ntransmitters into short-range remote controls. On\nRemotecentral.com, a Web site devoted to remote control, users have\nposted games, calendar programs and even musical selections for\nremote controls.\n\n   Marc Harmsen, marketing manager for the Philips Pronto, said,\n``There are theme songs for `The Simpsons,' `Indiana Jones' and\n`Star Wars.'''\n\n   But for all their increasing complexity, these high-end remote\ncontrols cannot avoid the problems that plague their lower-end\nbrethren. They still break, and they still sink behind couch\ncushions. Alpert's new all-in-one remote control broke seven months\nago, so he had to lug his basket of old controls out of storage.\n\n   ``Now the innocence is gone,'' he said. ``We know what life is\nlike if the remote breaks. We know the chaos.'' Alpert's family, he\nsaid, just stopped watching television. ``TV is supposed to be\nrelaxing,'' he said. ``Just to turn on the TV took five steps. It\nwas too stressful.''\n\n   The Zenith Radio Corp., which became Zenith Electronics, did the\nearly work in remote controls. Zenith was awarded an Emmy in 1997\nfor that work. The first television remote control, aptly dubbed\nLazy Bones, was introduced in 1950 and was connected by a wire to\nthe television set. The original purpose of the remote was to let\nviewers mute the sound of television commercials, because the\npresident of Zenith, Eugene F. McDonald Jr., detested commercials.\n\n   Since then, the remote control has become a cultural icon, a\nbane of television advertisers, a focus of household power\nstruggles and an enduring symbol of American life.\n\n   ``We are in a remote-controlled world,'' said Dan Williard,\npresident of Replacement Remotes. ``People are lost without it.''\nThe most frantic calls to his company come from people who need\nreplacements sent overnight before ``the big game,'' he said.\n\n   In theory, users manipulate their remote controls. But in\nreality, remotes often seem to manipulate their users, creating a\nkind of behavior that might appear peculiar to the generations that\ngrew up without them.\n\n   ``I won't get up from the couch to turn on the TV,'' said Mike\nJaeggi, a recruiter in Atlanta who finds applicants for technology\njobs. ``Instead I'll spend 10 minutes looking for the remote.''\n\n   Remotes have not simply propagated _ they have become mobile.\nThe first wireless remote, which used, in effect, tightly aimed\nflashlight beams, was introduced by Zenith in 1955. After remote\ncontrols won their freedom, they exercised it fully. Their\npreferred habitat is the small dark environs under couches and\nbetween seat cushions. ``The smallest possible spot they can fit\ninto, they can get into,'' said Scott Scheider, a software\nconsultant outside Philadelphia.\n\n   Remotes also scurry to other areas of the house, turning up in\nrefrigerators, under kitchen sinks and in bathrooms. Once Jaeggi's\nSony universal remote was misplaced by his brother. ``We were\nlooking for over an hour,'' Jaeggi said. ``I kept saying he was\ngoing to owe me a hundred bucks.'' They finally found it in the\ngarage.\n\n   Craig Nabat, president of Ambitious Ideas, a company that makes\na remote control locator called Findit, says that most Americans\nlose remote controls at least once a week, then waste time looking\nfor them.\n\n   nn\n\n   Where do runaway remote controls go?\n\n   Williard said that dogs and children were common remote-nappers.\nPeople often throw them away accidentally when they are cleaning\nup, he added.\n\n   Sometimes remote controls escape the house altogether. Scheider\nwas confounded when he found a remote control that did not belong\nto him in his living room a few weeks ago.\n\n   ``There has to be someone out there looking for the remote,''\nScheider said. He suspects that it might have accidentally dropped\nwhen his sister's family visited, but he has hesitated to ask her.\n\n   ``What if I find out it's not theirs?'' he said. ``What is the\nalternative? What if there is someone breaking into my place and\nleaving a remote there?''\n\n   Remotes and televisions are sometimes forcibly separated from\none another. ``We had our house broken into a few years ago,'' said\nMichael Kearl, a sociology professor at Trinity University in San\nAntonio. ``They stole the equipment but left the remotes. So in\nmemory of things that once were, we still have the remotes.''\n\n   Sometimes the remotes are the desired commodity in burglaries,\nsaid Linda Tranchetti, a service representative for Replacement\nRemotes. ``When people get robbed,'' she said, ``sometimes they\ndon't take the TV or stereo, but they take the remote controls. I\ndon't know why. I've heard that many, many times.''\n\n   While it is tempting to resort to restraining measures to keep\nremote controls from meandering, that seems to undermine the\nessence of the technology. ``We all acknowledge the remote's need\nto wander and hide under things,'' said Trueman, who replaced his\n10 remote controls with a Pronto. ``How awful is it to see a remote\ncontrol nailed or screwed into the nightstand of most hotels?''\n","Headline":"\nTHE ULTIMATE REMOTE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO LEAVE THE COUCH \n","Text":["\n   David Alpert, president of an Internet startup called\nMarketingInfo, admits that he is addicted to remote controls.
