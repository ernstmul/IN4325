Bungalos, 41,\nspent 15 years as a rebel fighting for autonomy for Muslims in the\nlargely Catholic Philippines. He attributes the poor economic\nprospects here to the government's disdain for Muslims, and to\nmultinational and Manila-based fishing companies that ``suck all\nour fish out of the ocean,'' leaving nothing for locals.\n\n   Yet he feels remorse. He wrote a letter to the kidnapped girl's\nparents asking their forgiveness, and is putting his children\nthrough school ``so they don't follow in my footsteps.'' His wife\nand their nine surviving children live in a two-room wooden shack\non stilts, with tin roof and without furniture or electricity, in a\ncoastal village east of Zamboanga City. Bungalos visits a couple of\ntimes a month, when he can slip away from his outlaws' island\nhideaway.\n\n   Five members of his gang have been killed in encounters with\nauthorities, and his wife says she would rather have him at home\nand go without food than live off pirate's loot. Bungalos says he\nwould endanger the whole village if he returned to society; he's a\nwanted man.\n\n   Catching him _ or any other pirate _ is harder than one might\nthink.\n\n   On patrol aboard the Filipino Flojo PG-386, a US-made 78-foot\ngunboat, Navy Commander H. Robert Balanon Jr. pointed out the\n``Eleven Islands,'' a circle of isles that are sanctuaries for sea\nbandits.\n\n   Pirates dart from one to another, hiding among the palms as\npatrols pass. In the Philippines, as in other archipelago nations\nlike Indonesia or Malaysia, there are simply too many islands to\nmonitor around the clock. The terrain confounds strangers, and\npirates often are protected by corrupt local authorities.\n\n   A long-running Muslim uprising in the Southern Philippines has\nalso fed piracy, as rebels have turned to crime at sea to fund\ntheir rebellion.\n\n   More than four months ago, the Abu Sayyaf group used speedboats\nto kidnap 21 people from a Malaysian resort; it has made millions\nby ransoming them. Last week, the group seized a 24-year-old\nAmerican and held him in a hideout on Jolo Island, where they\nreportedly demanded $10 million for his release.\n\n   ``When they see the Navy, they act like good guys. When the Navy\nisn't here, they're bad guys,'' Lieutenant Bonifacio Manicap said,\naiming his binoculars at rows of laundry flapping from lines on one\nof the hundreds of islands on the gunboat's patrol route, and at a\nhandful of people on a nearly deserted beach who stared back\nsuspiciously.\n\n   Balanon, the commander, pointed to a tangle of brush along the\ncoast of Pilas Island that looked much like any other _ until a\nsquint of the eye revealed a tiny gap just large enough for a\ncanoe, opening into a hidden lagoon.\n\n   Getting off a gunboat to pursue fleeing suspects into shallow\nwaters means abandoning the ship's formidable weaponry. Clambering\ninto an inflatable raft armed with just a .45-caliber handgun,\nManicap was understandably nervous.\n\n   ``These pirates have machine guns left over from World War II\nthat could sink a boat,'' he said. ``They have antitank guns. We'd\nbe helpless in this rubber boat if we encountered pirates now.''\n\n   There are hundreds of ``pirate islands'' across Asia that are\nsimply outside the reach of the law. Balanon's gunboat is fitted\nwith daunting armaments _ four .50-caliber machine guns, two 7.62mm\nmachine guns, and a 25mm automatic cannon. But for the safety of\nhis crew, he refused to disembark at Siasi, known as ``Texas\nIsland'' because every inhabitant is reputed to carry a gun.\n\n   Last November, two officers from a sister gunboat, PG-387,\nhopped ashore to buy cigarettes and were shot 30 yards away by\nbandits who then fled with their guns. It was daylight, so their\nmates assumed that the noise was from firecrackers. One man died on\nthe spot. The other staggered back to the ship, and the crew cast\noff immediately rather than risk taking him to the local clinic. He\ndied before they reached the nearest island with a hospital.\n\n   A weather-beaten metal sign over Siasi's single paved road\noffers a ``Welcome,'' but residents don't seem to echo the\nsentiment. Idle youths scowled at the Navy ship. A young boy\nfiddled with a 9mm pistol. The dusty, two-story wooden facades that\nlined the port seemed straight out of a hardscrabble frontier town\nin the American West. The only color breaking the monotony of brown\npeeling paint was a bilious yellow adorning the local ferry and the\nminarets of the mosque.\n\n   The presence of a gunboat didn't cow several groups of armed men\nwho strutted under the noon sun with M-14 and M-16 assault rifles\nslung across their chests. Balanon and his men stayed aboard,\nconscious that they could do nothing. This was the sea bandits'\nturf.\n\n   After years of denial, Asian authorities are acknowledging that\nthey have a problem. Some have launched joint patrols on the most\ndangerous waterways, such as the Strait of Malacca, at 500 miles\nthe world's longest strait, which links the Indian Ocean to the\nSouth China Sea. Indonesia announced recently that it would\nestablish a center to monitor ships entering it. The maritime\nindustry, meanwhile, is calling for governments to adopt tougher\nlaws and sign international conventions against sea crime.\n\n   Sensing a niche, security companies have cropped up in Britain,\nthe United States, Hong Kong, and Australia, providing former\nsoldiers to defend ships and to search for, and perhaps recover,\nmissing vessels. The services are controversial because of fears\nthat having armed mercenaries aboard could escalate the violence.\n\n     \n-----   \n  \n\n   The Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center in Malaysia has\nset up a 24-hour hot line to track missing vessels, with some\nsuccess.\n\n   Recently, it guided authorities to Global Mars, a Japanese\ntanker loaded with palm oil that had been hijacked in Malaysian\nwaters in February, its crew set adrift. Tips gleaned by the center\nindicated that the ship had been repainted and was operating near\nHong Kong as a phantom ship named Bulawan. China sent an aircraft\nto investigate, and police boarded it in late May, arresting 11\nFilipinos and nine Burmese. The ship was towed to the Chinese port\nof Zhuhai, where the suspected pirates are awaiting prosecution.\n\n   The Philippines is one of the first countries to try to respond\ncreatively to modern piracy, training and arming civilians to ride\naboard coastal fishing vessels.
