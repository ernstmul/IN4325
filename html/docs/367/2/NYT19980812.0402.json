Baker\nIII Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston and a\nformer U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Syria and Israel. ``The goal is\nto narrow that gap by crafting policies to enable us to more\neffectively identify, apprehend and bring to justice these\nterrorists. That's the real challenge.''\n\n   The difficulty is compounded, Djerejian said, because in\naddition to having to conduct an investigation in a foreign\ncountry, U.S. authorities are more often than not hunting\nindividuals who are being sheltered and aided by ``sponsor''\nnations, which help culprits obtain passports, identity documents\nand money, and provide safe haven.\n\n   Historically, the United States considers nations such as Iran,\nIraq, Libya, Pakistan and Syria as countries that sponsor\nanti-American terrorism.\n\n   By contrast, Djerejian said, major acts of terrorism that have\noccurred on American soil _ the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City\nFederal Building and the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in\nNew York City _ have been fairly quickly solved and the\nperpetrators tried, convicted and sentenced.\n\n   ``We have a good record of catching terrorists here because\nwe're on our own turf, because we don't have diplomatic\ndifficulties and because people like (Oklahoma City bomber Timothy)\nMcVeigh had no support,'' Djerejian said.\n\n   But consider the scorecard on some of the more serious attacks\non foreign soil in the last 15 years:\n\n   _ In April 1983, 16 people died when a car bomb driven to the\nfront of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut exploded. Although\nfundamentalist Muslims, including members of the Lebanese Party of\nGod, a Syrian and Iranian backed terrorist group led by Imad\nMughniyah, are suspected, there have been no arrests or\nconvictions.\n\n   _ A few months later, in October 1983, 241 people died in a car\nbomb attack at the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. The same groups\nas in the previous attack are suspected, but to date there have\nbeen no arrests or convictions.\n\n   _ In June 1985, U.S. Marine Robert Stethem, a passenger on Trans\nWorld Airlines Flight 847, is killed by Party of God terrorists who\nhave hijacked the plane. Four people, including Mughniyah, are\ncharged in a sealed indictment in the United States and one of\nthem, Mohammed Al Hamadi, is arrested and convicted in Germany for\nStethem's murder. There were no convictions in U.S. courts.\n\n   _ In October 1985, an elderly, American named Leon Klinghoffer\nwas shot and dumped overboard during the hijacking of the cruise\nship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean Sea. Four Palestinians were\nlater arrested after U.S. Navy jets intercepted an airliner and\nforced it to land at a U.S. base in Sicily. After their arrest,\nPresident Reagan declared, ``You can run, but you can't hide.'' The\nfour were convicted in an Italian court, but the alleged\nmastermind, Abul Abbas, was released.\n\n   _ After Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up in the sky over\nLockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 281 people,\nPresident-elect Bush pledged to ``seek hard and punish firmly,\ndecisively, those who did this if you can ever find them.'' Yet 10\nyears later, two men who have been indicted in the United States\nand who are on the FBI's most-wanted list remain in Libya with a $4\nmillion bounty on their heads.\n\n   _ Despite President Clinton's promise that ``the perpetrators of\nthis cowardly act'' will be apprehended, there have been no arrests\nand convictions for the March 1995 shooting of two U.S. diplomats\nin Karachi, Pakistan.\n\n   _ The same is true of two bombings in Saudi Arabia in November\n1995 and June 1996, when a U.S.-run military training center in\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia, and a military barracks in Dhahran were\nattacked, resulting in the deaths of 7 and 19 people, respectively.\n\n   There are limited, and mostly ineffective, tools available to\nthe United States to track down and arrest suspected terrorists,\nsaid Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with Kroll Associates, an\ninternational security organization. But before getting started, he\nsaid, one must clear a major obstacle, determining who is\nresponsible.\n\n   In some cases, like the shootings of four Houston oil company\nworkers last year in Karachi, he said, the United States just\ndoesn't know with certainty who did it. In other cases, U.S.\ninvestigators know who the individuals are, but don't have enough\nevidence to indict them. And then there are suspects against whom\nthere is sufficient and compelling evidence, but who simply cannot\nbe found.\n\n   Once an individual is identified, Jenkins said, there are,\nbasically five possible tools available to try and bring that\nperson to justice: If the person is being sheltered by a\n``sponsor'' nation, then sanctions can be applied to that nation;\nassassination could be an option if it were legal; military\nretaliation could be considered; culprits can be captured and\nbrought to trial; and ransoms can be offered to ferret out\nsuspects.\n\n   ``The problem is that all of these, individually and\ncollectively, are very poor instruments,'' Jenkins said. ``The\ntruth is that we really don't have the tools and the means to wage\nwar against terrorism.''\n\n   But, Jenkins said, U.S. efforts to track down and apprehend\nterrorists have improved somewhat in the past 10 years largely due\nto laws allowing the FBI to become involved in the investigation\nand government offers of millions of dollars in rewards, both for\ncatching terrorists, and preventing attacks.\n\n   The United States is offering $2 million in the embassy bombings\nin Africa.\n\n   ``Slowly things are changing,'' Jenkins said. ``Big sums of\nmoney on the table help.''\n\n     \n   \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nTERRORISTS WHO ATTACK U.S. TARGETS OVERSEAS OFTEN GO UNPUNISHED \n\n","Text":["\n   Within hours of hearing that their embassies in Kenya and\nTanzania had been bombed last week, Americans once again witnessed\nan all-too-familiar ritual: The president, somber and stern,\ndelivering a warning to the attackers that they would be tracked\ndown and punished for their crimes.\n","\n   ``No matter how long it takes or where it takes us,'' President\nClinton told the nation after the bombings, which killed more than\n250 people, ``we will pursue terrorists until the cases are solved\nand justice is done.''\n","\n   But while such hostility may make the nation feel momentarily\nbetter, the truth of the matter is that terrorists who attack U.S.\ntargets overseas are seldom apprehended and punished.\n","\n   During the past 15 years, beginning with the brazen car-bomb\nattack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut that killed 16 people in April\n1983, only a handful of perpetrators have been brought to justice\n   _    even fewer to courts in the United States.\n","\n   In some instances, investigators have a good idea of who the\ncriminals are and still, because of diplomatic and sovereignty\nconcerns, are not able to bring them to the United States for\ntrial.\n","\n   ``At the end of the day, there is a gap between the rhetoric and\nthe action,'' said Edward Djerejian, director of the James A.
