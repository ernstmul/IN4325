SENNOTT  \n c.1998 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   GAZA CITY _ He was once the face of terrorism.\n\n   Mohammed ``Abbul'' Abbas _ the most wanted man in the world 13\nyears ago after masterminding the Achille Lauro hijacking _ is now\na middle-aged, overweight chain-smoker who holds court in the\noffices of the Palestinian Liberation Front, the small organization\nhe leads here with the permission of Yassir Arafat.\n\n   But the source of his notoriety has not changed. ``You Americans\nnever forget, do you?'' he asks. ``You always want to ask about the\nman in the wheelchair.''\n\n   That man was the elderly and frail American Leon Kling-hoffer,\nwho was shot in the head by Abbas's men and tossed from the cruise\nship into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n   ``Look, we feel very sorry of all that happened on the ship,''\nhe continues. ``We know how hard and painful it is when someone is\nkilled who is not related to the conflict. We have seen it happen\nto thousands. Millions more have been displaced from their homes,\nand the world never apologized to us. We hope one day the world\nhears our cries as loud as it heard Kling-hoffer's.''\n\n   Abbas now says the Achille Lauro was a ``mistake.'' He claims\nthat his men had only intended to use the Italian luxury liner to\nslip into Israel, not commandeer it. But, he adds, their cover was\nblown when a crew member saw them cleaning their weapons.\n\n   When asked why Kling-hoffer was killed, he replies: ``He created\ntroubles. He was handicapped but he was inciting and provoking the\nother passengers. So the decision was made to kill him.''\n\n   Abbas's presence in Gaza today is an anomaly. Despite his 30\nyears as guerrilla leader bent on destroying the state of Israel,\nAbbas was permitted by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu to return from exile to the Palestinian-controlled area\nthis spring.\n\n   And the United State has dropped its efforts to extradite Abbas\nfor his role in the murder of Kling-hoffer.\n\n   How Abbas was allowed to enter Israel's borders, without\nobjections from the United States, offers a glimpse into the\nwrenching compromises required to make peace in the Mideast. His\nhigh profile in Gaza has infuriated the Kling-hoffer family and\nprompted a petition to Israel's high court for his extradition.\nSome critics feel it renders hollow Netanyahu's podium-pounding\ntirades against terrorists.\n\n   Abbas's return to a crowd of thousands of cheering Palestinians\non April 28 also shows how Thursday's hard-core terrorists can\nbecome today's freedom fighters and politicians. It is a\ntransformation played out from Ireland to Algeria to Vietnam. And,\nof course, it occurred in Israel's own struggle for independence,\nwhen Jewish forces detonated bombs that killed civilians.\n\n   Abbas is now 50 years old, the same age as the Jewish state that\nhe has worked most of his life to destroy.\n\n   He says he was 13 days old in 1948 when his family fled Haifa\nfor a refugee camp in Lebanon. When the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization launched its armed struggle in 1964, Abbas became one\nof its youngest recruits. In 1968, he was in North Vietnam fighting\nalongside the Viet Cong against US forces and learning guerrilla\ntactics. By 1970, he was putting those skills to work. He planned\nan attack _ the first of its kind _ firing a Katyusha rocket into\nIsrael from Lebanon. It struck a school bus and killed 11 children.\n\n   By the late 1970s, he was known in the Palestinian resistance as\na major military strategist who used unorthodox tactics. His men\nrode hot air balloons and hang gliders to penetrate the border of\nnorthern Israel. They raided Israeli beaches in rubber dinghies\nloaded with shoulder-launched grenades and machine guns.\n\n   But the incident that made him infamous was the 1985 hijacking\nof the Achille Lauro, off Port Said, Egypt. Abbas was not on board,\nbut his men held some 400 passengers hostage. With the exception of\nKling-hoffer, the passengers were released after a two-day ordeal.\n\n   Egypt then put Abbas and his men on a flight for Tunisia, where\nthe PLO was headquartered. But the United States dispatched Navy\nfighters to force the flight down in Sicily, under Italian\njurisdiction.\n\n   Despite angry protests from the United States, Italy allowed him\nto flee before a US warrant for piracy and kidnapping could be\nserved. Abbas disappeared, despite worldwide manhunts and a\n$250,000 price on his head.\n\n   Along with two other Palestinians, he was convicted in absentia\nin an Italian court and sentenced to life in prison. But he never\nspent a day behind bars and has lived in Lebanon and Iraq for most\nof the last 13 years, assiduously avoiding US and Israeli security\nservices by donning disguises and moving constantly.\n\n   ``When America wants you, the whole world is part of the hunt,''\nhe says.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nACHILLE LAURO PLOTTER RECAST AS PROPONENT OF MIDEAST PEACE \n","Text":["\n   GAZA CITY _ He was once the face of terrorism.\n","\n   Mohammed ``Abbul'' Abbas _ the most wanted man in the world 13\nyears ago after masterminding the Achille Lauro hijacking _ is now\na middle-aged, overweight chain-smoker who holds court in the\noffices of the Palestinian Liberation Front, the small organization\nhe leads here with the permission of Yassir Arafat.\n","\n   But the source of his notoriety has not changed. ``You Americans\nnever forget, do you?'' he asks. ``You always want to ask about the\nman in the wheelchair.''\n","\n   That man was the elderly and frail American Leon Kling-hoffer,\nwho was shot in the head by Abbas's men and tossed from the cruise\nship into the Mediterranean Sea.\n","\n   ``Look, we feel very sorry of all that happened on the ship,''\nhe continues. ``We know how hard and painful it is when someone is\nkilled who is not related to the conflict.
