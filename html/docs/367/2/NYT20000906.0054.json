LAKSHMANAN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   NEAR SACOL ISLAND, Philippines _ He has neither hook nor peg\nleg, but he is missing parts of two fingers and an inch of his left\nleg, shot off in skirmishes with the Philippine Navy.\n\n   He has no cutlass, preferring seven assault rifles, a grenade\nlauncher, and an array of automatic pistols. And who needs an eye\npatch when you can snatch a nice pair of imitation Ray Ban\nsunglasses from the captain of the ship you've just raided?\n\n   Aliasa Bungalos, known and feared as ``Commander Alex'' around\nthe lawless islands and hidden coves that dot the turquoise waters\nof the Southern Philippines, is a latter-day Captain Kidd.\n\n   Guarded by a crew masked in balaclavas and bandannas and\nbrandishing M-16s, Bungalos recently let a journalist visit a\ndeserted island hideout, 11 miles east of the Philippine Navy's\nsouthern base in Zamboanga City, for an extraordinary look at the\nlife of a pirate leader. Casually, he described what he does for a\nliving: sneaking up on ships in a fast launch, clambering up ropes\nto board under cover of night, kidnapping and ransoming victims,\nselling off the stolen loot.\n\n   He is hardly unique.\n\n   Piracy is back with a vengeance, and Bungalos is one of tens of\nthousands of bandits of the sea who have spurred its resurgence\nover the past decade. They prey on merchant mariners, fishermen,\nshippers, even pleasure sailors and scuba divers of all\nnationalities. Seajacking also poses severe environmental and\nsafety hazards in busy sea lanes. In 1994, two oil tankers collided\nand burned, killing all aboard, after what was thought to be a\npirate attack.\n\n   The number of reported pirate attacks has set a record this\nyear, and Asian waters are the new buccaneers' favored haunt. The\nregion's financial crisis, which began three years ago, the\npolitical instability and armed insurgencies, and some of the\nglobe's busiest shipping lanes, have made Asia the site of three of\nfour pirate attacks worldwide.\n\n   But forget ``Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum.'' Piracy does not\nfit the Hollywood image of Treasure Island, swashbuckling fun, and\ntalking parrots. Buccaneers who terrorized the Caribbean in the\n1700s were merciless criminals who forced their victims to walk the\nplank while they stole a ship and its cargo.\n\n   Modern pirates are sometimes members of sophisticated crime\nsyndicates who use global positioning systems, satellite phones,\nfalsified papers, and powerful speedboats to pull off\nmultimillion-dollar heists of tankers and cargo ships. But more\noften they are hit-and-run bandits in motorized dinghies who prey\non fishermen, ferries, and yachtsmen, robbing them of any valuables\naboard. Bungalos's gang is one of these.\n\n   What's common to almost all of these attacks is their\nruthlessness, the use of deadly weapons _ from knives and handguns\nto antitank rockets and mortars _ and the cost to the maritime\nworld in lives, cargo, and ships.\n\n   With 90 percent of the world's trade moving by ship, and nearly\nhalf of it passing through Asia's pirate-infested waters, the\nthreat to global commerce is growing. Estimates of the cost of\npiracy and maritime fraud run to more than $16 billion a year.\n\n   The pettiest incidents are essentially maritime muggings by\nthose who subsist by stealing fish, mooring lines, or cans of\npaint.\n\n   The most serious are meticulously planned attacks in which\norganized crime gangs target valuable cargo, resell it in advance,\nand prepare fake registration papers for a ship.\n\n   In the worst cases, pirates kill the crew, repaint and rename\nthe vessel, and use the ``phantom ship'' to attack other vessels or\nto steal millions of dollars of cargo from unsuspecting shippers\nwho unwittingly hire the pirates' fly-by-night company to transport\ntheir goods.\n\n   Shipowners reported 300 attacks or attempted attacks in 1999 to\nthe International Maritime Bureau, an industry watchdog, and 309 to\nthe United Nations' International Maritime Organization. But the\nMaritime Bureau says the figures understate, by at least half, the\ntrue picture.\n\n   In figures compiled for the Globe, the Philippine Navy and coast\nguard cited 28 pirate attacks in the first six months of this year.\nThe International Maritime Bureau recorded just one in Philippine\nwaters, based on reports from shipowners.\n\n   Why the discrepancy? Cargo ships often do not report minor\nattacks because they fear being detained by investigators; every\nday in port costs thousands. Captains and shipowners sometimes\ncover up attacks to protect their reputations. Coastal ships and\nfishermen, meanwhile, report only to local authorities _ or not at\nall, if they fear retribution.\n\n   But the danger is growing. So far this year, reports of pirate\nattacks have jumped 40 percent over the first half of 1999,\naccording to the Maritime Bureau.\n\n   Indonesian waters are by far the world's most dangerous, with\n115 incidents reported in 1999, almost double the figure for the\nyear before.\n\n   Last year, 408 seamen were taken hostage, a jump of 67 percent\nfrom 1998.\n\n   As far back as 800 BC, sea bandits have plagued waters from\nTaiwan to New Guinea, from Madagascar to Australasia, said a\nPhilippine Navy captain, Omar Tonsay, who has chronicled maritime\nraids in the region.\n\n   Bandits of the Sulu Sea, in what is now the Southern\nPhilippines, have long been reputed to be among the most vicious.\n\n   But Tonsay says that what 16th-century colonizers branded\n``piracy'' was for locals ``a tradition _ economic livelihood for\nmen and women, a rite of passage.''\n\n   Islands provide pirates with countless safe hideouts. The\ntangled branches of wild mangroves, and the shallow around Sacol\nIsland keep Bungalos and his gang out of sight and out of the reach\nof the law. Dragging on a counterfeit Marlboro and showing off his\nbullet scars, Bungalos recounted his resume while a Navy gunboat\npatrolled not a mile away.\n\n   Late one night, he and 12 of his gang used motorboats to attack\nthe Randy-Mar, a commercial fishing boat that had been preparing to\ncast out its nets. They used the ship's anchor line to hoist\nthemselves aboard and stole fish-detecting sonar, ship radios, and\nthree guns, which they sold for 80,000 Philippine pesos ($1,778).\nAnother time, three of his men boarded the Magnolia ferry as\npassengers and took the captain at gunpoint.\n\n   They then threw ropes to seven accomplices in a launch below,\nwho shinnied on deck to steal cash, watches, jewelry, even clothes\nfrom terrified passengers and crew.\n\n   Bungalos's men have used speedy outriggers to zoom into coastal\ntowns and to snatch victims whose families could pay, including the\n13-year-old daughter of a gas station owner. After holding her for\nthree months on Sacol Island, a pirates' lair where, Bungalos said,\n``she was not touched, raped, or harmed,'' he negotiated $8,000 in\nransom and got ``three sacks of rice as thanks when we released the\ngirl.''
