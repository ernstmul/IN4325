LAKSHMANAN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   SHANWEI, China _ There was no SOS signal, no storm, no sighting\nof a sinking ship. A 14,000-ton freighter just vanished into thin\nair.\n\n   On Nov. 16, 1998, the Cheung Son, a Hong Kong-owned cargo ship\nloaded with furnace slag, lost contact with its owners en route\nfrom Shanghai to Malaysia.\n\n   Two weeks later, a horrified fisherman near this southern\nChinese port pulled up his net to find a bound corpse, its mouth\ntaped shut and lashed to a 175-pound metal bar. It was the first of\n10 bodies found tangled in nets in the following weeks, all later\ndetermined to be among the 23 members of the Cheung Son's crew. The\nship itself was never seen or heard from again.\n\n   A long coastline, a booming and increasingly deregulated\neconomy, and powerful organized crime networks have made southern\nChina a hub for the most serious form of modern piracy: the\nhijacking of entire cargo ships, which are repainted, renamed, and\nused to troll for fresh victims at sea. With the crew disposed of\nand the ship under a new flag, the pirates advertise these ghost\nvessels as legitimate cargo carriers and then disappear with the\ncargo.\n\n   Since January 1999, China has cracked down, devoting hundreds of\npolice officers in dozens of cities to solving six of the most\nserious cases of modern piracy. Chinese courts have dealt harshly\nwith the perpetrators.\n\n   After the capture of scores of Chinese, Indonesian, Burmese, and\nFilipino suspects _ and the well-publicized execution this year of\n14 of them _ robberies in the South China Sea have nosedived, and\nmurders during high seas attacks have dropped off to nearly zero,\naccording to international figures.\n\n   The Chinese crackdown has begun to quiet earlier accusations\nthat Beijing was soft on crime at sea or even colluding with the\nperpetrators.

Authorities issued an international\nall-points bulletin and called the ship's phone and fax repeatedly.\nSomeone answered, but kept hanging up.\n\n   Meanwhile, clubbed and bound bodies began turning up near\nShanwei, a port at nearly the same longitude as Kaohsiung. Police\nhit the docks and learned that a local man ``went to sea and came\nback with a lot of money and a dented boat,'' said Ni Baodui,\ndeputy director of the Shanwei Public Security Bureau.\n\n   Police combed nearby ports for suspicious craft and hit pay dirt\nin Dongshan, in the neighboring province of Fujian. Authorities\nsecretly boarded a boat and found a 30-foot-long scratch with paint\nfrom another vessel. A lab test confirmed that it matched the paint\nof the Cheung Son.\n\n   In early January 1999, police tracked down the owner of the\ndented boat, who was hiding in a fishing village not far from\nShanwei. He admitted he had lent his vessel to two other men and\nsaid they could be found in Shenzhen, a seedy, freewheeling area\nnext to Hong Kong.\n\n   Three hundred police officers raided a karaoke bar where gang\nmembers were celebrating and surrounded the two ringleaders,\ntackling one in a football-style pileup when he tried to buy a\ntrain ticket to escape.\n\n   The Indonesian leader of the gang told authorities he was paid\n$350,000 for the ship and cargo by his boss, an Indonesian named\nRoger who worked for a Singapore shipping company. He couldn't say\nwhere the freighter was, and police were unable to track down\nRoger. Li said Indonesian authorities ignored numerous requests for\nhelp from Beijing.\n\n   In the course of interrogation, authorities learned that the\nCheung Son gang members or their alleged kingpin had been involved\nin at least three other high-profile pirate attacks, a break that\nled to the arrest of 22 suspects in the Sept. 9, 1998, attack on\nthe Luisa, a Singapore-based palm oil tanker.\n\n   Li Xiaoping, head of the organized crime task force for\nGuangdong province _ a bureau that devoted all of last year to\npiracy investigations _ said police discovered that the pirates had\ndisguised themselves as officials to get onto ships for bogus\ninspections.

He cited the case of the Tenyu _ a ship\ncarrying aluminum ingots that was hijacked in Indonesia and found\noff southern China, renamed Sanei I.
