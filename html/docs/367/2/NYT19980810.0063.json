Times News Service   \n\n   Hours after the deadly car bombings at the U.S. embassies in\nKenya and Tanzania on Friday, President Clinton vowed to hunt down\nthose responsible ``no matter what or how long it takes.'' But\nhistory suggests it can take a very long time.\n\n   When terrorists take aim at Americans abroad, the perpetrators\nare rarely identified with any certainty and seldom caught or\npunished _ almost always because of the complications of joint\ninvestigations with foreign countries.\n\n   This time U.S. officials hope for better cooperation in what the\nState Department described as the first nearly simultaneous\nterrorist attacks in separate countries. The bombs, apparently in\nvehicles parked outside the embassies, killed more than 60 in\nNairobi, including eight Americans. Another 1,100 people were\ninjured. At least nine people were killed in Dar es Salaam, none\nAmerican, and scores were injured.\n\n   The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in June 1996 is a grim\nexample of the difficulties of solving a case: A truck bomb\ndetonated at an apartment building, killing 19 U.S. airmen. The\nsecond anniversary of that attack passed two months ago with U.S.\nauthorities expressing exasperation over their inability to\nidentify those involved, and admitting privately that the\ninvestigation had collapsed because of disputes with Saudi\ninvestigators.\n\n   The following is a review of the federal government's progress\nin some of the major terrorist attacks against Americans in the\n1980s and 1990s.\n\n   Date: April 1983\n\n   Event: U.S. Embassy in Beirut is bombed.\n\n   Death toll: 16 killed.\n\n   Suspects: Elements of the Lebanese Party of God, the militant\nIranian- and Syrian-backed terrorist group, led by Imad Mughniyah.\n\n   Status: No arrests or convictions. Many of the terrorists\ninvolved in the plot are believed to be living in Lebanon. The FBI\nnearly captures Mughniyah in 1995 after the bureau learns that he\nis aboard a commercial jet that is scheduled to make a stopover in\nSaudi Arabia. At the last minute, the Saudis refuse to allow the\nplane to land, and it goes on to Beirut. The United States protests\nto the Saudis.\n\n   Date: October 1983\n\n   Event: U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut is bombed.\n\n   Death toll: 241.\n\n   Suspects: Elements of Lebanese Party of God led by Imad\nMughniyah.\n\n   Status: No arrests or convictions.\n\n   Date: June 1985\n\n   Event: TWA Flight 847 is hijacked en route from Athens to Rome\nand forced to land in Beirut.\n\n   Death toll: One, an American, Robert Dean Stethem, who is shot,\nhis body dumped on the airport tarmac in Beirut.\n\n   Suspects: Elements of Party of God, led by Imad Mugniyah.\n\n   Status: No arrests or convictions in American courts. Charges\nbrought against four people, including Mugniyah, in a sealed\nindictment in the United States. One of the hijackers, Mohammed Ali\nHamadi, is arrested on terrorist charges in Germany in 1987 and\nconvicted there for Stethem's murder. He is sentenced to life in\nprison. Germany refuses American requests for extradition.\n\n   Date: October 1985\n\n   Event: Four gunmen hijack Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro off\nthe Egyptian Coast, demanding release of Palestinian prisoners in\nEgypt, Italy and elsewhere.\n\n   Death toll: One, Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old disabled\nAmerican tourist is killed, his body dumped into the sea.\n\n   Suspects: The Palestine Liberation Front, allied at times with\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\n   Status: No arrests or convictions in American courts. After the\nhijackers give up the ship and depart Egypt by air, their plane is\nintercepted by Navy fighters over the Mediterranean and forced down\nin Italy. The four hijackers are convicted by Italy in 1986 but two\nescape from prison. One, Magid Molgi, who confesses to killing\nKlinghoffer, is caught and returned to prison. The man identified\nas the mastermind of the hijacking, Abul Abbas, is released by\nItaly despite Washington's pleas that he be held for trial.
