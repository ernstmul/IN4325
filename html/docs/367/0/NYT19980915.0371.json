Times News Service    \n\n   Going back to the neighborhood of one's youth and finding\nfamiliar objects smaller than remembered is an experience shared by\nmost of us. I had the same feeling, not long ago, picking up a CD\nof Ravel's piano music and finding on its cover the shrunken image\nof an LP record I knew some 45 years ago.\n\n   Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series, of which this\ntwo-CD release is a part, represents a foolproof sales strategy, at\nleast where the middle-aged market is concerned. For this is our\npast, perfectly reconstructed _ nostalgia we can touch in\nminiature. If Proust's ode to memory celebrates the power of smell\nand taste, those of us who grew up in the postwar hinterlands,\nwhere music inspired not just neglect but also suspicion, well\nremember the look and touch of those old cardboard LP covers.\n\n   They and their contents emerged month by month from labels like\nColumbia, RCA Victor, London, Decca, Mercury and Westminster. We\nwore them on our shelves as fragile icons. Roughly 12 inches square\nand already prone to disintegration, they were medals earned, or at\nleast diplomas of advancement.\n\n   This particular series _ four LPs now reduced to two CDs _\noffered Robert Casadesus, the French pianist with strong American\nties, playing Ravel's piano music almost complete. (The G major\nConcerto is the principal omission.) Helping out are his wife,\nGaby, also a pianist; the violinist Zino Francescatti, and the\nPhiladelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.\n\n   If anyone was wondering how the spirit of the early-music\nmovement could be transposed to the record industry, look no\nfurther. For here is Columbia's original cover design (ugly, as\nmost covers were in those days), complete with ``LP'' printed at\nbottom right. Early-music's blend of archaeological rectitude and\nmodern compromise are perfectly mirrored here. Original notes are\nretained though now translated for an international buying\naudience.\n\n   Salvaged even are the inner sleeves. ``A high fidelity recording\ndesigned and engineered at Columbia Sound Laboratories,'' we read\non one. ``Variable groove'' techniques of manufacture are discussed\nalong with the relative merits of the diamond, sapphire and osmium\nneedle. On another sleeve is Columbia's ``current'' roster of\nartists, from Dimitri Mitropoulos and Pierre Bernac to Bernard\nBaruch and Gertrude Berg. Picture period-instrument Mozart in\nVienna's Redoutensaal: authentic materials authentically packaged.\n\n   Yet the scratches of those old surfaces have been taken away;\nthe monophonic sound quality is materially improved. (If Sony had\nwanted REAL authenticity, it would be handing out Variable\nReluctance cartridges and Garrard turntables to play these items\non.) Also updated is the listener's sensibility. What sounded like\n``right in our living rooms'' a generation ago is now a bit hollow\nand distant, but the ear adjusts.\n\n   Indeed, the imagination still remains uppermost in every\nhigh-fidelity adventure, for I doubt that the most splendid\ndigitalized and stereophonic sound today has any more auditory\nimpact than what Columbia gave us in 1952.\n\n   The performances are pretty much as I remember them: dignified,\ncareful, deeply caring, sometimes upright to a fault. Small errors\nindicate an absence of splicing. Quick pieces like the Sonatine and\n``Jeux d'Eau'' are still too fast, a tribute to Casadesus'\nextraordinary prowess, but an example, perhaps, of how technique\ncan acquire an unwanted life of its own. There are in fact moments\nbetween phrases when the music longs to draw a breath and luxuriate\nin its activities, but the pianist presses on. If the four-hand\nversion of ``Ma Mere l'Oye'' seems brisk, at least Casadesus and\nhis wife have rescued it from the composer's cloying reinvention of\nthis piece for orchestra.\n\n   Today, however, I am most impressed by the simpler music: the\nextraordinary leading of inner voices in the familiar ``Pavane Pour\nune Infante Defunte,'' and the subtle goads these strands provide\nto the overall movement. Casadesus thought through every subtlety\nof the ``Valses Nobles et Sentimentales,'' arguably the best music\nRavel ever wrote. Perhaps the true evidence of the pianist's\nrectitude lies in the faithfulness of his tempos, which no heat of\nthe moment is able to disturb.\n\n   There is one other inauthentic component in Sony's new\ntransaction: the listener himself. The 1952 version of these\nparticular ears was eager and acute; its counterpart 46 years later\nis battered around the nerve endings but more reflective because of\nit. The blind, white-hot reactions of the young are gone; the\nmiddle-aged receptacle is less capable of the old thrills yet at\nthe same time less susceptible to being fooled. The trade-off is\nwrenching but unavoidable.\n\n   The 1998 listener-model also has a hard time mentioning Ravel\nand Debussy in the same breath, where once it was an easy\nassertion. Ravel's several and sometimes contradictory spirits are\nall here in Sony's project: the elegant attachment to the Baroque\n(``Le Tombeau de Couperin''), the passionate sensuality (the\nSonatine), the affectionate mockery (``Valses Nobles et\nSentimentales''), the fascination with how instruments sound\n(``Ondine'').\n\n   The classicist and the exotic mix freely, and the composer's\ncalculating eye is always on himself. Debussy, one better\nunderstands with age, dreamed as Wagner did, of mysterious and\npotent worlds far beyond Ravel's earthbound though wonderful art.\nStravinsky called Ravel ``the Swiss watchmaker.''
