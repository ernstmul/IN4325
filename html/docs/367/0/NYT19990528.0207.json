The Democrats were able to use the\nColumbine High School shooting and bombing incident, in which 15\npeople were killed and 21 wounded, as a catalyst for action on\ngun-control measures that otherwise would not have been considered\nthis year.\n\n   House Democrats hope to at least match the Senate initiatives,\nwhich would expand the current background check laws to include\nhandguns purchased at gun shows and pawn shops. The bill also\ncontains measures requiring that trigger locks or other child\nsafety devices be sold with all new handguns, and that the\nimportation of large capacity ammunition clips be banned.\n\n   While embracing the general concepts of the Senate bill, House\nRepublicans have warned that what they end up supporting could be\ndifferent.\n\n   For example, many Republicans and some Democrats don't like the\nSenate measure requiring up to a 72-hour waiting period on gun\npurchases as opposed to an instant background check. An expected\nmove to raise the age for gun ownership to 21, which is supported\nby Hastert, also troubles some Republicans and Democrats.\n\n   ``What comes out of the House bill could be less, it could be\nmore,'' said one Republican leadership aide. ``The whole game for\nRepublicans here is just to avoid the mistakes and the\nembarrassment the Senate made.\n\n   ``There will be (background) checks at gun shows and pawn shops\nbecause most members support some kind of background check. And\nthere will be gun locks in the (House) bill because that's not a\nhuge issue since most makers are already including them with their\nguns. The question is how far will we go in accepting the Senate\nlanguage?'' the aide said.\n\n   By giving ground on gun control, Republicans are hoping to win\nsupport from Democrats on a few other issues they consider more\nimportant in the fight to curb youth violence. Those issues include\nstricter enforcement of current gun laws and tougher jail and\nprison sentences for youthful offenders.\n\n   Michelle Davis, press secretary to House Majority Leader Dick\nArmey, R-Texas, also said Republicans want to focus more attention\non ``cultural issues,'' such as violence depicted in movies and\ntelevision, which they believe are contributing factors to\ntragedies like the Colorado incident.\n\n   ``The country as a whole knows that the answer to Littleton\ninvolves much more than gun control ... and we want to make sure\nthat these other problems are addressed,'' said Davis, who accused\nthe Democrats of ``shamelessly'' using Littleton as a ``political\ntool'' to help pass tougher gun-control measures.\n\n   By trying to head off an extended fight in the House over\ngun-control issues, she said, House leaders are hoping to avoid the\ndisaster that occurred during the Senate debate. In that debate,\nthe Democrats succeeded to some extent in portraying Republicans as\nsupportive of loopholes in the current laws that actually make it\neasier for criminals and kids to get guns.\n\n   ``After what happened in the Senate, we figured ... we want\nthings to be a little more orderly,'' Davis said.\n\n   The decision by the House Republican leadership to endorse a set\nof gun-control measures before a vote came in a meeting last week\nin which Hastert, Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas agreed\nthat there would likely be enough votes among Republicans and\nDemocrats in the wake of Littleton to pass moderate legislation.\n\n   Rather than risk a split within their ranks over the issue, and\nto head off a Democratic effort to portray them as weak on\ngun-control issues, Hastert decided to announce that amendments\nwould be allowed to the juvenile justice bill when the House takes\nit up in mid-June.\n\n   In a speech on the floor, Hastert acknowledged that recent\nincidents of school violence had understandably shaken the nation\nand that parents were right to demand that their representatives do\nmore to protect their children.\n\n   ``We support common-sense legislation that keeps guns out of the\nhands of unsupervised children,'' the speaker said. But he added\nthat passing gun-control measures ``is only part of the solution''\nas he called for support of measures to ``reinforce positive\nvalues'' in the nation's culture that will help ``create a safer\nand more secure society.''  \n\n     Hastert's floor speech caught Democratic lawmakers by surprise.\n\n   ``I think they were clearly under a lot of pressure from the\npublic because of what happened in Littleton,'' said Rep. Ken\nBentsen of Texas, one of several Democrats who has been pressing\nthe Republican leadership to allow votes on gun-control amendments.\n\n   ``The Republican leadership doesn't want it to appear that\nthey're being pushed into this, knowing they'll have to accept\nit,'' he said.\n\n   ``The writing was on the wall,'' agreed one Republican aide.\n``It was either give 'em what they want or go through weeks of hell\nwhile the Democrats tried to use gun control as a political issue\nagainst us.''\n\n   Despite Hastert's decision, there were signs late last week that\nsome GOP members might revolt if pressed to accept the Senate\ninitiatives as written.\n\n   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., for example,\nexpressed support himself for ``common sense'' gun-control\nmeasures, but warned that some measure in the Senate-passed bill\ncould conflict with the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\n   Efforts by some Democrats to broaden the scope of the Senate\ninitiatives could cause problems for some of their own colleagues\nwho generally favor tougher gun-control measures, but only up to a\npoint.\n\n   Bentsen, for one, said he would find it difficult to limit gun\npurchases to once a month as some Democrats are proposing. He said\nhe would also be reluctant to go along with a proposal by Hastert\nand others in both parties to raise the age limit on gun purchases\nfrom 18 to 21.\n\n   ``We need to be cautious in raising age restrictions too high,''\nhe said ``It's a question of responsible gun ownership.''\n\n   The Democrats were trying to force a vote on the Senate-passed\nbill before mid-June even as the House was adjourning last week for\nits Memorial Day recess.
