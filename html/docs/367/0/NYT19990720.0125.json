The mere presence\nof one in San Diego Bay earlier this year set the huge sailing\ncommunity there on its ear.\n\n   ``Everyone was saying, `Did you see? Someone brought a Concordia\nyawl into the bay,' '' recalls Dan Nowlan, director of the Offshore\ndepartment of the US Sailing Association, the national governing\nbody for the sport. ``There are thousands of boats in San Diego\nBay, but this is the one everybody wanted to see.''\n\n   It has been that way since the late Ray Hunt picked up Harrier,\nhis Concordia yawl, at the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in\nLemwerder, Germany, in 1955 and walked off with six firsts in six\nraces at Cowes, the prestigious international race week off\nEngland. A year earlier, Dan Strohmeier won the Bermuda race on his\nConcordia, Malay, at 39 feet the smallest boat ever to win that\ncelebrated contest.\n\n   On Friday (July 16), 25 of these ocean aristocrats glided to\nSouth Wharf by Dartmouth's Concordia Boatyard here to celebrate\ntheir 60th anniversary, which was to have been held last summer but\nwas postponed because of a bad storm. There were also five owners\non hand who came without their boats. Kersten Prophet, who owns the\nonly Concordia in Germany, flew from the Baltic for the occasion.\n\n   These saltwater folk traded stories and fibs over libations that\nevening and then raced a 15-mile course Saturday in the chop of\nBuzzards Bay. The wind was out of the southwest at a spirited 20\nknots, good air for the yawls.\n\n   These guys are obsessed. ``We're all nuts,'' says Walter Schulz,\nowner of Absynthe. ``But instead of fast women and booze, I've done\nit with wooden boats.'' He first saw Absynthe a few years ago under\na tarpaulin. It was badly in need of repair. ``I opened the cover,\nand that was the kiss of death,'' he adds, shaking his head. ``Life\nhas never been the same since.''\n\n   Schulz, who owns the Shannon Boatyard in Bristol, R.I., finished\nbuilding a 43-foot, state-of-the-art, fiberglass sailboat last week\nthat will sell for $650,000. Yet he sails a Concordia, modest by\nthose standards. ``It keeps me in touch with the Phoenicians,'' he\nexplains.\n\n   Such remarks surprise no one familiar with the Concordia\nmystique. Owners of the yawls, built at 39 or 41 feet with their\nmizzenmasts located behind the rudder post, will drop whatever they\nare doing to sail. And they're great on water. ``The Who's Who of\nAmerica yachting got into these boats,'' says Brodie MacGregor, the\ncurrent owner of the Concordia Boatyard and organizer of the\nreunion. More Concordias would have been here this weekend but for\nthe regatta at Edgartown and the New York Yacht Club cruise to\nHalifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n   Concordia owners even have their own newsletter, published twice\na year by Skip Bergmann (owner of Paramour), in which they write\ndetailed narratives about endless maintenance and cruising.\n\n   To own one of the 103 Concordia yawls made between 1938 and 1966\nis to belong to a club as subtle as it is exclusive. ``It is a\ncult,'' says Strohmeier, now 88, who has skippered 15 Bermuda and\n18 Halifax races. A cult, yes, but an active one. No boat has been\nlost yet, and almost all are still on the water _ a stunning\nrecord.\n\n   There are far more expensive boats to be had, far faster ones,\ntoo. But then there is pride, first among the seven sins. In words\neerily intoned by other Concordia owners, John Bullard, who sails\nCaptiva, the yawl his father bought 34 years ago, says, ``I love\nsailing into a harbor and watch everyone on every other boat turn\ntheir heads.'' What's more, adds Ted Danforth, owner of Oriane,\n``They all know the make. They ask, What number hull is that?' ''\n\n   The Concordia yawl speaks about the values and taste of an owner\nas do few other possessions. It is wooden boat in an age of\nfiberglass, an elegant one in an inelegant time. ``If God had said\n`yacht,' he'd have thought of a Concordia,'' says Danforth, who has\nsailed on 150-foot schooners. ``It is an entirely simple elegance.\nIt is exactly the right size. It is the perfect Zen thing.''\n\n   The yawl was built to cruise Buzzards Bay but excelled as an\nocean racer as well. It was designed in 1938 by Ray Hunt, better\nknown for the Boston Whaler, the deep V hull craft that\nrevolutionized the power boat industry; the 110 and 210 classes of\nsailboats; and Easterner, the 12-meter that sailmaker Ted Hood said\nwas ahead of its time.\n\n   But the driving force behind the Concordia yawl (and most\neverything else in these parts) was the late Waldo Howland, who\nowned the boatyard and tapped Hunt to design a boat after his\nfather's boat was destroyed in the hurricane of 1938.\n\n   The first four Concordias were built in New Bedford and Boston.\nAfter World War II, though, an extraordinary relationship began\nbetween Concordia and the Abeking and Rasmussen shipyard in\nGermany. From 1950 to 1966, the next 99 boats were built there,\nthen shipped from Bremen by steamer to Boston and towed through the\nCape Cod Canal to Padanaram, where they were finished. All of them\nwere built without a single contract. Everything was based on the\nhandshake.\n\n   From a distance, the Concordia is simply easy on the eyes. Up\nclose, it is an exquisite piece of work, crafted from oak, African\nmahogany, locust, and butternut. Its spars were made of Sitka\nspruce, its decks of teak, sometimes topped with canvas. ``Every\nscrew, visible or not, is lined up with the grain of the wood,''\nsays Bullard. ``You know the hands that screwed that screw.''\n\n   Above all, it is spare. ``My father was always reducing things\nto their essence,'' says Kinnaird Howland, one of his four sons.\n\n   Waldo Howland wanted a boat that would be timeless. He got it in\nthe Concordia. Part of the allure of his yawls is that they have\nnever been out of fashion because they were not built to the\nstrictures of International Offshore Rule.\n\n   When other boatyards built to the IOR, ``All the boats began to\nlook the same,'' says Dan Nowlan. ``None looked like the graceful\nConcordia yawls.''\n\n   Bullard recalls that in 1975 he crewed on a boat in the one-ton\nworld championships that was considered the fastest in its class at\nthe time. By August 1976, it had been outdesigned. ``In nine\nmonths, we went from the fastest in the world to a boat with no\nchance,'' he says. It is notable, then, that a Concordia won the\nBermuda race in 1978, 24 years after its first victory.\n\n   Howland abhorred what he called ``the IOR horror'' almost as\nmuch as he despised fiberglass. ``That's not where the truth was,''\nexplains his son, who recalls his father asking, voice laced with\nsarcasm, ``Why not have a fiberglass diningroom table? They're\neasier to clean. Or why not a fiberglass violin?''\n\n   ``He loved wood,'' explains the younger Howland. ``It's kind to\nthe touch. It requires that you take care of it, and it's good to\ntake care of things. He felt that a wooden boat was something that\nis worth having.''\n\n   Waldo Howland had particular ideas about a lot of things. ``When\nyou had a daiquiri with my father, it had to be with Key limes, not\nPersian limes,'' he adds. ``He could never get a decent one at a\nbar.''\n\n   The boat's sheer beauty explains in part why people pay $120,000\nfor a Concordia yawl in good shape _ seven times what one cost new\nin the early Sixties. But never lost in its looks is its marvelous\nsailing ability. It is a dream to handle in most conditions and\nsuperb when it starts to blow. ``Two knowledgeable sailors can sail\nthat boat in almost any weather,'' says Larry Moulton of\nMarblehead, owner of White Wave.\n\n   The yawl is also narrow, heavy, wet, and a tight squeeze for the\ncrew of six needed for serious offshore racing. It doesn't like\nlight air. A new boat half its size has far more room below. ``It's\na canoe,'' says Kinnaird Howland. Worse, upkeep means the\nhemorrhaging of time and money. But, he adds, none of this matters\nbecause of ``the Concordia thing'' _ the mystique of the boat.\n\n   ``Logic does not prevail here,'' concedes Rusty Aertsen, owner\nof Snowbird and a smaller Concordia sloop, Kestrel. ``They grow on\nyou like golden retrievers.''\n\n   Which was just what Waldo had in mind.\n","Headline":"\nBALLET OF CLASSIC BEAUTIES GRACES BUZZARDS BAY \n","Text":["\n   PADANARAM, Mass. _ They look like nothing else on the water.\n","\n   They enter a harbor as a beauty enters a room.
