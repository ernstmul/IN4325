Home users only account for about 15 percent,\nthe company said.\n\n   Last year, the enforcement activities of the industry lobbying\ngroup, the Business Software Alliance, collected $10 million in\nfines from companies using software for which it did not have\nlicenses. The settlements are up from $6 million in 1996. Earlier\nthis month, a Massachusetts company, Intertek Testing Services,\nagreed to pay $78,500 to the BSA for having unlicensed software,\nincluding copies of Adobe, Lotus, Microsoft and Symantec.\n\n   The money is put back into the BSA to pay for more enforcement\nefforts. As the industry has cracked down on pirated software, the\nenforcement staff has shot up. The BSA's staff of 35 has almost\ntripled since 1996.\n\n   Microsoft officials, in Atlanta last week as part of last week's\nMicrosoft Explorer 99 exhibition, are starting an anti-piracy ad\ncampaign.\n\n   The lost sales cut into Microsoft's bottom line, it claims. The\ncompany last week said it made $1.92 billion in the last three\nmonths on sales of $4.33 billion.\n\n   But Microsoft says the use of illegal software hurts everybody.\nFlawed counterfeit software can corrupt the information entrusted\nto it.\n\n   The company has taken things a step further, placing the impact\nof software piracy in your pocket. According to Microsoft, the use\nof illegal software cost Georgia, for example, $157 million in\nsalaries and close to $23 million in tax revenue.\n\n   The figures come from a study by the Redmond, Washington, branch\nof International Planning & Research, a consulting firm for the\nhigh-tech industry. IPR arrived at its tax estimates by multiplying\nthe typical number of software programs on a PC by the estimated\nnumber of PCs shipped in Georgia in 1997, according to IPR's David\nFay, who worked on the study.\n\n   IPR took that figure and subtracted the estimated number of\nsoftware applications software companies shipped in 1997. The\ndifference between the two figures was considered to be the number\nof software programs illegally acquired. IPR took that number,\nmultiplied it by a typical retail price for software and used that\nto determine the estimated losses in sales tax.\n\n   But the estimated tax loss assumes the money not spent buying\nsoftware the legal way was not spent at all, Fay said.\n\n   That's not a valid assumption, said Donald Ratajczak, director\nof Georgia State's economic forecasting center.\n\n   ``Microsoft is trying to say this is a big problem, and that's\nvalid,'' he said. ``But any numbers for individual states are total\nestimates and it doesn't really wash one way or the other. Is there\nanyone in their right mind who thinks the companies would be doing\nless on software because of the pirating?''\n\n   Ratajczak said there are legitimate moral issues involved with\nthe idea of using pirated software. But the economic impact is\nminimal.\n\n   ``One wonders why Microsoft is worried about this. I continue to\nwonder at who is making the corporate decisions at Microsoft: what\nto put on email, how to approach the public. One wonders,'' he\nsaid. ``They know how to market software, they sure don't know how\nto market themselves.''\n\n   Mark Clothier writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\nAtlanta, Ga.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Microsoft and the rest of the software industry are\ntrying harder to get you to stop stealing what they make.\n","\n   Almost 27 percent of the software used by businesses in the\nUnited States was illegally obtained, according to Microsoft.\nMicrosoft estimates that most of the pirated software, 65 percent,\nis used by small- and medium-sized businesses, so that's the group\nthey're going after.
