Times News Service clients)  \n By DEWAYNE SMITH  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX - There were two hometown boys in Sunday's MCI WorldCom\n200 Indy Racing League contest at Phoenix International Raceway.\n\n   Both led the race, but Phoenix-born Eddie Cheever Jr., whose\nfamily moved him to Europe at a young age, crashed.\n\n   On the other hand, Valley native and Glendale resident Billy\nBoat placed fourth.\n\n   But despite a no-show in the victory circle and a pit strategy\nthat went awry, Boat is pleased with how his day ended.\n\n   ``We had a pretty good car today,'' Boat said of his A.J.\nFoyt-owned Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara ride. ``It was\nhandling well _ I really can't complain.\n\n   ``However, our qualifying setup wasn't very good, so we had to\nstart in the 12th row. Normally, it seems we do it the other way\naround.\n\n   ``Being in the top five, however, is the kind of finish we want\nto see. We're looking for consistency. Last year we were on the\nhook (crashed) way too often.''\n\n   Boat, who picked up $71,700 for his effort, worked his way up\nthrough most of the 27-car starting field and inherited the lead on\nthe 99th circuit following a yellow-flag session for a crash.\n\n   He then led the field until Lap 128, when he pitted under green\nfor tires and fuel and then never got close enough again to worry\nthe leaders.\n\n   ``We knew we were going to have to pit, so we took on tires and\nfuel on the chance the race would stay green,'' said the\n33-year-old Boat whose car owner Foyt is a four-time Indianapolis\n500 winner.\n\n   ``Actually we were hoping for a caution period so we could pit,\nbut that didn't show up so we took our chances during green. And\nthen the race didn't stay green, so we didn't get either one.''\n\n   Sunday's race was the IRL's second of the season. In the opener,\nJanuary 24 at Walt Disney World Speedway, Boat placed ninth.\n\n   He now heads to Charlotte, N.C., to prepare for the season's\nnext outing May 1. Then he's on to the Texas Motor Speedway and\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway for testing before the famed\nIndianapolis 500 May 30.\n\n   Boat's teammate, Sweden-born Kenny Brack, didn't fare as well,\nalthough he started a row ahead of Boat.\n\n   Brack got caught up in a three-car tussle on Lap 47 that also\ninvolved Steve Knapp of Salem, Wis., and Raul Boesel of Curitiba,\nBrazil.\n\n   The damage was too great for Brack and Knapp to return to the\noval battle, but Boesel lasted another 100 laps before low oil\npressure ended his day.\n\n   Boat, who came up through the dirt track racing ranks to the\nIndy-type cars, has competed in 17 IRL races during the past three\nyears, with one win, and has been fastest qualifier seven times.\nHis victory came at Texas Motor Speedway last season.\n\n   He also won the pole position and led the first 12 laps of last\nyear's Indianapolis 500.\n\n   Boat, who set a record of 11 straight wins in the U.S. Auto Club\nWestern States midget series in 1995, is used to coming from behind\nto win, but he just ran out of time Sunday.\n\n   An Arizona State University graduate, Boat lives in Glendale\nwith his wife, Andrea, and four children.\n\n   He owns B&B Fabrication, a metal fabrication/welding shop that\nspecializes in exhaust systems for high-performance automobiles.\n\n   All in all, Boat said he thought his finish had been a good one\nfor the hometown fans.\n\n   ``If our pit strategy had worked, we would have been heroes,''\nsaid Boat. ``I was a little disappointed after qualifying, but it\nis the race that counts.\n\n   ``So, it's great to finish.''  \n","Headline":"\nGREEN-FLAG PIT STOP COSTLY TO BOAT \n","Text":["\n   PHOENIX - There were two hometown boys in Sunday's MCI WorldCom\n200 Indy Racing League contest at Phoenix International Raceway.\n","\n   Both led the race, but Phoenix-born Eddie Cheever Jr., whose\nfamily moved him to Europe at a young age, crashed.\n","\n   On the other hand, Valley native and Glendale resident Billy\nBoat placed fourth.\n","\n   But despite a no-show in the victory circle and a pit strategy\nthat went awry, Boat is pleased with how his day ended.\n","\n   ``We had a pretty good car today,'' Boat said of his A.J.\nFoyt-owned Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara ride. ``It was\nhandling well _ I really can't complain.\n","\n   ``However, our qualifying setup wasn't very good, so we had to\nstart in the 12th row.
