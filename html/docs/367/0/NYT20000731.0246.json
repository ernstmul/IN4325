Times News Service    \n\n   LENOX, Mass. _ Many of America's masters recently descended upon\nthe Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health here for a conference on\n``The New American Yoga.''\n\n   Virtually anyone who has bought a book or video, attended a\nworkshop, or unfurled a mat in a major studio would have recognized\nsomeone here. This was as close to a summit meeting as yoga has\ncome.\n\n   Erich Schiffmann of Los Angeles, the star of a best-selling yoga\nvideo featuring Ali McGraw, declared the conference a ``power\nspot.'' Sharon Gannon and David Life, the founders of the favored\nrock star hangout, Jivamukti Yoga in Manhattan, came to teach and\nstump for animal rights.\n\n   Veterans like the Bay Area's Rama Jyoti Vernon mingled with\nyounger masters like Baron Baptiste, who teaches power yoga on\nESPN. Other yoga teaching stars included Rod Stryker, Don\nStapleton, Judith Lasater, Todd Norian and John Friend.\n\n   The group represented the scope of approaches, from sweaty\n``strong'' yoga to tension-melting restorative poses, that are\ntaking yoga beyond the confines of the counterculture to the\nmainstream of American fitness. They came to stretch and breathe\nwith eager students in the weekend's daily classes, but more\nimportant, they came to discover what their approaches had in\ncommon, and how they might add up to a definition of American yoga.\n\n   These leading lights had one thing in common: none were of\nIndian descent. Most had studied with Indian masters, including the\nnow-elderly triumvirate of BKS Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Sri\nTKV Desikachar, whose principles of precision, heat and healing\nstill dominate the discipline. But as they devised their own\nstyles, the Americans mixed their knowledge with native experience\nto create the wide-ranging approach that has caught on today.\n\n   ``In the '60s and '70s, a number of swamis came to the U.S., and\nthere was an emphasis on the spiritual side of yoga,'' said Kathryn\nArnold, editor of Yoga Journal, the unofficial organ of American\nyoga, in an interview during the conference. ``The philosophy was\nmore integrated into the asana practice,'' she said, referring to\nposture. ``They've all gone away, basically, or they've really\naged. And there's been this inheritance of the yoga by the\nAmericans themselves. And so we are redefining it. ''\n\n   Indian teachers still influence American yoga. Integral, the\nschool led by Swami Satchidananda from his ashram in Yogaville,\nVa., has dozens of schools nationwide. Bikram Choudhury's hot yoga\ntechnique is popular in Hollywood. Yet like American Buddhism, the\nyoga shaped by Western-born teachers has its own attributes. Its\npractical, world-friendly character is having an impact on\nAmericans who would never visit an ashram.\n\n   Yoga Journal says that 12 million people practice hatha yoga,\nthe physical limb of a system that also includes ethics, breath\nwork and meditation. Instructors here have combined different\nstrains of Indian yoga to suit modern American tastes. Many have\nbeen drawn by the athletic ashtanga-based styles that have become\npopular here.\n\n   Others prefer gentler therapeutic styles like Kripalu. Americans\nare sticking to their yoga mats long after tae-bo videos have been\nburied in the closet. Indeed, yoga is so popular that a group of\nlongtime leading practitioners, the Yoga Alliance, has formed to\nexplore criteria for certification.\n\n   To say American yoga is just aerobics with chanting misses a\nlarge reason for its popularity. For many, the practice is\nspiritual, or at least psychological. Books like Schiffmann's\n``Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness'' are as\npopular as old-fashioned self-help tomes. People who once turned to\ntherapy now seek inner peace from teachers who simultaneously help\nthem tone their abs.\n\n   ``There's a bifurcation in the psychotherapy world, as a result\nof managed care in this country,'' said Stephen Cope, a Kripalu\nteacher, psychotherapist and the author of ``Yoga and the Quest for\nthe True Self.'' ``You've got managed care, very focused on\nmedication, with short-term time limits on psychotherapy. Then you\nhave this whole stream of people, the so-called worried well, with\ntheir spiritual quests, their desire to be fully alive, their\nattempts to be in better relationships. Where are they taking that?\nThey're not taking it to psychotherapy any more, because they can't\nafford it.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Americans use the yoga mat as a therapist's couch, and often, as\na church pew.\n\n   ``Our culture really likes the physical stuff,'' said John\nAbbott, the publisher of Yoga Journal. ``We're all ingrained from\nthe earliest age that it's good to do exercise.

The model based around\na charismatic leader often led to egotism and corruption and\nstudents fled disillusioned. In addition, many Americans grew wary\nof adopting a culture that was not their own. ``Most of the major\nashrams did fall,'' said Sudhir Jonathan Foust, Kripalu's director\nof curriculum. ``Maybe because of the sensitivity of these\nparticular cultures, they were the first to fall.

His famous quote was, `How can you know God if you don't\nknow your big toe?'''\n\n   The major question for American yoga is how to reconnect God and\nthat big toe.\n\n   The Kripalu conference often felt like a strictly religious\ngathering, with chanting, meditation, and talks like Schiffmann's,\nwhich extrapolated on basic Eastern ideas of nonduality, and\nGannon's, a discourse on the relationship between ahimsa, the Hindu\nethic of nonharming, and animal rights. The last question Foust\nasked the gathered teachers, at a closing panel, was, ``Do you\nbelieve enlightenment is possible?''
