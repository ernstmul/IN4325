Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from their victory on gun control in the\nSenate, Democrats on Friday trained their attention and oratory on\nthe House, calling for a gun-control vote within the next week and\nlambasting Republican leaders for laying out a less immediate\ncourse.\n\n   In making that demand, House Democrats were plucking a page from\nthe play book of their Senate counterparts, who greeted every\nRepublican concession on gun control over the past two weeks with\nthe charge that it was too little, too late and still out of step\nwith public opinion.\n\n   House Republicans, who had promised on Thursday to allow a vote\non gun-control measures by the middle of June, accused Democrats of\nengaging in political theatrics. But even as the two sides sniped\nat each other about timing, they agreed that the House would\nprobably pass at least a few new restrictions on firearms.\n\n   ``I think there will be some aspects of what the House does\nwhich will include making it more difficult for teenage kids to get\nahold of guns,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, the Republican\nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime.\nMcCollum's juvenile crime bill would be the likely vehicle for\nthose measures.\n\n   A dozen House Democrats met with President Clinton at the White\nHouse Friday afternoon to plot their strategy for making sure the\nmeasures succeed. The plan, they said, was to use whatever bully\npulpit they had to persuade Republican leaders to act now, before\nconservatives in the party or gun lobbyists disrupted the momentum\nof events in the Senate.\n\n   Clinton, for his part, was expected to address gun control in\nhis weekly radio address on Saturday.\n\n   Several lawmakers who spoke with Clinton on Friday said that he\nurged House Democrats push for at least one measure in addition to\nthose passed by the Senate: a raise in the minimum age for handgun\npurchases and possession to 21 from 18. House Speaker J. Dennis\nHastert of Illinois early this week indicated support for raising\nthe age for purchases, though not possession.\n\n   ``We're going to make our voices heard every day,'' said Rep.\nNita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., after leaving the White House.\n\n   Mrs. Lowey, who is expected to run for the Senate next year if\nfirst lady Hillary Rodham Clinton does not, added, ``I wonder if\nall those people afraid to send their kids to school want to see us\ndebate this issue for the next few weeks.''\n\n   Although Republican leaders could bring the bill passed by the\nSenate to the floor immediately, it would be highly unusual.\nInstead, they intend to let a similar House bill proceed through a\nHouse committee and then come to the floor.\n\n   The pledge by Republican leaders to let a debate on gun control\noccur indicated an unequivocal alteration in the political climate,\njust as the bill passed by the Senate on Thursday night had.\n\n   That legislation, approved by a vote of 73 to 25, contained an\narray of new regulations, such as a requirement that licensed gun\ndealers include child safety devices with every handgun they sell,\nrestrictions on the possession of semi-automatic assault rifles by\nthose under 18, mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun\nshows and a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.\n\n   None of those measures represented monumental shifts in public\npolicy. But, taken together, they were arguably gun control\nadvocates' biggest victory in Congress in half a decade.\n\n   If the House passes similar measures as part of its own juvenile\ncrime legislation, the House and Senate bills would then go to a\nconference committee to reconcile any differences. A final vote\nwould be held before sending the measure to the White House. A\nWhite House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said Friday night that Clinton\nwas hoping that a House bill went further on gun control and had\nnot yet decided whether he would sign a bill like the Senate's.\n\n   Already, House Republicans have signaled more receptiveness to\ngun control, though they have also exhibited a nervousness about\nthe debate being forced on them too quickly.\n\n   On Thursday, as the Senate was passing its legislation, both the\nHouse Appropriations and Judiciary committees postponed hearings to\nfinalize two separate bills after Democrats threatened to try to\nattach gun-control amendments. One of those bills was McCollum's,\nwhich Republicans had been insisting was not an appropriate vehicle\nfor gun control.\n\n   Hastert and the Democratic minority leader, Richard Gephardt of\nMissouri, met Thursday afternoon to decide how and when to deal\nwith the gun-control measures the Senate had passed.\n\n   Hastert said that the measures could indeed fold into McCollum's\nbill and suggested a vote in the middle of June. But when Gephardt\npresented that plan to fellow Democrats a few hours later, many of\nthem pronounced it unacceptable.
