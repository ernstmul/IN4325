The association charged in the suit\nthat Diamond's device, called the Rio, would ``facilitate and\nencourage'' music piracy by making it easy to download bootleg\nmusic using MP3 technology.\n\n   I wrote about MP3 last month. It lets people take music from a\nCD, record or tape; compress the sound into a digital file; and\nthen ship the file over the Internet so others can download it,\nuncompress it and listen to the music.\n\n   Music pirates have used MP3 to put thousands of copyrighted\nsongs up on Web sites where people can download these bootleg\nfiles. But so far, to hear bootleg MP3 files, you must hook\nspeakers up to a computer.\n\n   This is where the Rio comes into play. Diamond created Rio to\nmake MP3 music portable by storing digital files on memory chips in\nthe device. The Rio can play an hour's worth of recorded music on\nbatteries that last half a day.\n\n   In its lawsuit, the RIAA is trying to halt distribution of the\nRio _ before Diamond can create a market for its two-ounce playback\ndevice   .    There have been other MP3 portable devices. But they cost\nmore and did less than Rio, making the new device the first real\nthreat.\n\n   The RIAA has charged Diamond with violating the Audio Home\nRecording Act, which was passed in 1992 to discourage music piracy\non Digital Audio Tape. Among other things, the AHRA forced DAT tape\nmakers to pay a royalty on each tape they sold, to compensate music\npublishers for the piracy that would take place on DAT.\n\n   RIAA is trying to apply the logic to Diamond in the world of MP3\nmusic stored on computer chips. It will ask the federal courts to\nrule that the Rio device is covered under the same laws as DAT\ntapes.\n\n   That may be tough, says Bob Kohn, an expert on music law. Kohn\nis hardly a neutral source. He is, after all, chairman of GoodNoise\nCorp., a Palo Alto startup that sells music in the MP3 format.\n\n   But he is also the author of a textbook on music copyrights and\nhas said the 1992 act on DAT tapes specifically exempts all\ncomputer-based devices.\n\n   ``The RIAA lawsuit ought to be laughed out of court,'' Kohn\nsaid.\n\n   For its part, Diamond will go into court Friday to argue that\nthere's plenty of legitimate music _ much of it from smaller or\nlesser known bands _ available for sale in the MP3 format. It\nargues that this is the legitimate market it is going after.\n\n         ``The RIAA is really trying to limit access to\ndistribution,'' said Ken Wirt, Diamond's vice president of\nmarketing. ``If you're a little guy and you want to get your music\nin a record store, you have to go through them. They don't like the\nidea of music distribution over the Internet.''\n\n   RIAA attorneys did not return calls, but they'd see things\ndifferent. The 1992 act also required DAT tape makers to implement\na copy protection scheme to limit piracy. So far, piracy protection\nisn't part of the MP3 technology, and this lawsuit seems like the\nmusic industry's way of forcing the issue.\n\n   _   Polling experiment:    Today, most political polls are done on\nthe phone. But Harris Black Internation, the company that runs the\nHarris Poll, will use the Internet this year to try to pick the\nwinners in 18 Senate and gubernatorial races _ including\nCalifornia's _ on election day.\n\n   Harris Black President David Clemm said his pollsters have spent\nthe last year assembling a database of 1 million Internet users who\nrepresent the country's racial, economic, occupational and\ngeographic groups.\n\n   ``We know what they look like, we know what they think and we\nknow how they compare to the larger population,'' Clemm said.\n\n   Since January, Harris Black has surveyed this Internet sample on\npolitical matters like the Lewinsky scandal.
