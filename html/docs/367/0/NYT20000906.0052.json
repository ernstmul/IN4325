LAKSHMANAN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   PATALON, Philippines _ Joel Quino knows what it's like to walk\nthe plank.\n\n   It was a sunny March afternoon, and he was fishing in a small\ndinghy, a mile and half offshore from this village in the southern\nPhilippines. Suddenly, two masked men wielding M-1 rifles sped up\nalongside in a motorized canoe and shouted, ``Ambak pare!''_ ``Jump\noverboard, pal!''\n\n   He obeyed, and in a matter of seconds, the pirates stole his\nentire life savings and his means of livelihood _ a tiny boat with\nan outboard engine.\n\n   ``I thought I going to drown,'' said Quino, 34, who was rescued\nby a passing fisherman. But his problems had just begun.\n\n   In this village of 200 subsistence fishermen and their families,\nhe is one of 50 victims who have lost their boats or engines to\nsmall-time but heavily armed pirates. Every penny of the\nfishermen's earnings had gone into their tiny boats, and with an\naverage income of $77 a month, not one believes he will ever save\n$700 to buy a new boat, engine, and nets. They now borrow dinghies\nfrom their luckier neighbors and split the catch with them 50-50.\n\n   Victims of modern piracy come in all stripes _ from poor\nfishermen who lose their livelihoods, to shipping tycoons who have\nto write off multimillion-dollar tankers, to yachtsmen whose\nvacations turn into nightmares.\n\n   ``Seventy-eight seafarers were killed by pirates in 1998, most\nof them in Asian waters,'' said Corey Bousen, publisher of Lloyd's\nList Maritime Asia, a trade journal. ``If 78 Americans were\nmurdered on a bus in downtown Boston, you'd hear about it for 10\nyears. But because these killings are at sea, and most victims are\nfrom third-world countries, nobody takes notice.''\n\n   The maritime industry has started to mobilize, however.\nShipowners are debating the merits of hiring former soldiers to\nescort or recover their ships, and some have installed hidden\ntracking devices to monitor vessels if they are seajacked. Crews\nare urged to keep fire hoses ready to ward off attackers, and post\nsailors on round-the-clock watches on floodlit decks.\n\n   Some captains now avoid the most dangerous waters of Indonesia\nand Malaysia and the coasts of Bangladesh and Somalia. Yachtsmen\nhave begun to sail in convoys and skip some deserted ``paradise\nisles.''\n\n   Mike Severns, a Maui-based underwater photographer and biologist\nwho used to lead yacht trips to remote islands, still feels a chill\nwhen he recalls a horrifying Indonesian holiday two years ago.\n\n   He and six friends had anchored their 90-foot ironwood boat off\nthe island of Salajar, by the southern tip of western Sulawesi.\n``We had just finished dinner,'' Severns recounted, ``and before we\nknew what happened, we turned around, and instead of the crew, we\nsaw 12 men with handguns.\n\n   ``This is the horror of piracy. You're in the middle of nowhere,\nno one knows where you are, and there's no place to run. They could\nhave shot us, ransacked the boat and sunk it, and no one would have\nknown.''\n\n   Severns talked his way out of the situation, addressing the men\nas if they were maritime police conducting a search, and telling\nthem he worked for the national airline's flight magazine, which\nseemed to impress them. ``I guess they figured robbing us could\nbring a problem, and we weren't worth their while.'' But that was\nfar from the end of his adventures.\n\n   Six months later, off the northern tip of Babar Island, 200\nmiles east of East Timor, he and five friends were doing a night\nscuba dive when they were surrounded by canoes filled with\nscreaming attackers. Severns, the divers' guide, and the captain of\ntheir boat were taken ashore, where the guide and the captain were\nbeaten nearly unconscious, while the others escaped back to the\nboat.\n\n   The attackers had heard that ``tourists are rich, and they\nthought we'd have thousands of dollars lying around on deck,''\nSeverns said.\n\n   Although his jaw was broken, the captain managed to escape and\nswimback to the yacht. ``The last thing he saw was mobs attacking\nus, and he gave the order to cut the anchor line and go to sea.\nThey heard cheering like a rugby match, and they thought we were\ndead.''\n\n   The yacht's mayday signal was picked up by a woman who relayed\ntheir call for help.\n\n   Ashore, Severns and his guide were being held by the village\nchief, who wanted a ransom of 220 pounds of rice and 110 pounds of\npork.
