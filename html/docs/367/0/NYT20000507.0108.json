By DAVID LEONHARDT   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   A traveler prints a boarding pass and luggage tags from her\noffice computer, drives to the airport and walks straight past the\nsnaking line at the main counter. She drops her bags on a conveyer\nbelt and dashes to the gate, where the bar code on her boarding\npass causes her photograph to appear on the gate agent's computer\nscreen. Her entire time in the airport, from curb to gate: less\nthan 10 minutes.\n\n   At the moment, this scenario is little more than a dream for all\nbut a few elite passengers. Airports are more crowded than ever,\nand lines are much longer than they were even a few years ago.\n\n   But in a competition to attract the business travelers who are\nresponsible for most of the carriers' revenue, major airlines are\nspending tens of millions of dollars on new technology.\n\n   They hope to whisk passengers through terminals more quickly,\nredefining what industry executives glumly call ``the airport\nexperience.''\n\n   By the end of the year, Continental Airlines plans to have 300\nATM-like computers across the United States that allow people to\nprint their own boarding passes and baggage tags. Delta Air Lines\nhas spent $750 million over the last two years wiring airports and\npreparing to introduce similar gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds\nto canceled flights at its hubs by rolling out banks of wireless\nphones with direct connections to its reservations desk.\n\n   And Alaska Airlines, the most aggressive recently in using\ntechnology, allows people with electronic tickets to print boarding\npasses from their home or office computers.\n\n   As part of a pilot program, it has also scanned the driver's\nlicenses of about 500 frequent fliers into its computer system. The\nbar code on the boarding pass retrieves both the driver's license\nand a larger photo, so travelers never have to reach into their\nwallets before boarding the plane.\n\n   For now, business travelers are the main beneficiaries of the\nimprovements. Some of the initiatives, such as calling passengers'\ncell phones to tell them about a late flight, are available only to\nthe top tier of frequent fliers, and others, like the kiosks,\nappeal mainly to travelers who do not check bags.\n\n   Continental has even installed a kiosk in the lobby of AT&T's\ncorporate headquarters in New Jersey, so travelers there can get\nboarding passes before they arrive at the airport. And Northwest is\ntesting a program that allows employees of 10 Midwestern companies\nto print their own passes off the airline's Web site.\n\n   But unlike some other recent perks for corporate road warriors _\nlike expanded first-class sections or the installation of double\nbeds on overnight flights _ much of the new technology will\neventually be available for all passengers to use, industry experts\nsaid.\n\n   ``Airports weren't designed for the volumes they're now\ngetting,'' said Michael L. Zea, a vice president in Mercer\nManagement Consulting's airline practice. ``There's a lot of strain\non the system, and technology can be very helpful in easing that.''\n\n   Of course, automated systems are not always reliable. During a\nthreatened strike by US Airways employees in March, passengers\nholding electronic tickets needed old-fashioned paper tickets to\nhave any hope of getting a seat on another carrier. And if the\nairlines eventually replace agents with the machines, they could\nboth anger their unions and force passengers to do more work in\norder to board a plane, travel experts said.\n\n   But after a year in which consumer complaints more than doubled\nfrom their 1998 level, industry executives say that shortening the\nlines at their airport counters is a sure-fire way to boost their\ncarriers' images.\n\n   As air travel has surged during the long economic expansion, and\nthe size of airports and airline staffs has failed to keep up, the\naverage amount of time that travelers spend on line at the main\ncounter has reached 16 minutes, up 20 percent from three years ago,\naccording to Airport Interviewing and Research, a White Plains,\nN.Y., company that surveys passengers.\n\n   The stricter security standards that the government has adopted\nin recent years have added to the lines, as well.\n\n   As a result, no matter what travelers think of folding\nthemselves into a middle seat or drinking the airlines' mediocre\ncoffee, they will generally be happy if their trips take less time\nthan they have come to expect, airline executives say. ``You can\nmake up for a lot of coffee sins by having a line that's been\nreduced,'' said Dirk C. McMahon, the senior vice president for\nground operations at Northwest Airlines. And at $10,000 apiece, the\nmachines cost much less than additional employees.\n\n   The stakes are high enough to have led to two recent lawsuits\nbetween airlines with different views about how best to move\npassengers through airports. Continental has sued both Delta and\nUnited to force them to remove metal templates on baggage X-ray\nmachines that prevent passengers, including Continental's, from\ncarrying large bags onto airplanes.\n\n   Continental says that its planes' overhead compartments are\nlarge enough to hold the bags and that allowing customers to carry\non luggage instead of checking it reduces delays. Delta and United\nsay the big bags result in overstuffed bins that cause delays.\n\n   Though it is unclear which argument holds the most sway with\npassengers, they clearly care deeply about the issue. Bill Harsh, a\nmanagement consultant who flies over 200,000 miles a year, said he\nhas stopped flying United, once his main carrier, because he could\nno longer carry on his luggage.\n\n   ``I had a bag that fit in every overhead compartment in America\nbut did not fit through their template,'' said Harsh, who lives in\na Maryland suburb of Washington.\n\n   A spokeswoman for United said the airline has received few\ncomplaints about the templates.\n\n   For now, though, the biggest attempts to reduce lines involve\ntechnology. Delta and other carriers are putting up computer\nscreens near gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions,\nsuch as the reason for a delay, that often clog lines. Northwest's\nagents in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to\nprint boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.\n\n   The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation of\nthe ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska, Continental\nand Northwest have put them in dozens of airports across the\ncountry, and British Airways and Alitalia, among others, use them\nin Europe. Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and\nWashington for shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version\nin Aspen, Colo.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of the\nmachines but probably would have had to hire more new agents\nwithout the kiosks.\n\n   Typically about 6 feet tall, the machines allow passengers with\nelectronic tickets to insert a credit card, print a boarding pass\nand sometimes change their seats or get a ticket on an earlier\nflight. The machines pose, in text form, the security questions\nthat gate agents ask passengers who check in in the old-fashioned\nway.\n\n   For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one, at\nthe kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, N.J., used one of them\nlast week at Newark International Airport before boarding a\nContinental flight on a business trip. ``They're quicker even than\nwhen there are no lines'' at the counters, she said. ``I don't have\nto talk to anyone.''\n\n   They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no bags\nto check and no questions to ask a gate agent.\n\n   Only Alaska Airlines, in Anchorage, Alaska, and Portland, Ore.,\nnow permits passengers to print their own tags and then drop them\nonto a conveyer belt from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on\nthe plane. The other carriers make passengers using the kiosks wait\nin a line _ usually separate from the main one and shorter _ to\ncheck their bags.\n\n   The airlines have also not fully explained the policies to\ntravelers, analysts said. Smith, for example, said she believed she\ncould not have used the kiosk at all if she had wanted to check a\nbag.\n\n   In addition, the kiosks do not yet give fliers the same control\nthat talking to an agent does, particularly for frequent travelers\nwhose requests the airlines often meet, noted Samuel C. Buttrick,\nan airline analyst at PaineWebber. ``I can't ask that the seat next\nto me be left open. I can't ask about upgrade wait lists. I can't\nask questions about the status of a connecting flight,'' Buttrick\nsaid, adding that he rarely uses the kiosks.\n","Headline":"\nAIRLINES IN A PUSH FOR SHORTER LINES \n","Text":["\n   A traveler prints a boarding pass and luggage tags from her\noffice computer, drives to the airport and walks straight past the\nsnaking line at the main counter.
