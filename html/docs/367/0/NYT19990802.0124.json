Some donors are\nlongtime friends and admirers, like MIT's Lester Thurow. Others see\nan opportunity to make a bigger splash in an underdog campaign.\nSome contributors, former Celtics great John Havlicek, Celtics\ncoach Rick Pitino, and New England Patriots executive J. A. Kraft,\nfor example, have roots, like Bradley, in the world of sports.\n\n   And some of Bradley's backers, looking at polls that show Gore\nrunning behind Texas Republican Governor George W. Bush, think\nDemocrats need to move beyond the scandal-plagued image of the\nClinton-Gore years.\n\n   ``There is a mild degree of disenchantment with the existing\norder, with the Clinton-Gore administration, though with some\nacknowledgment that Gore isn't culpable, just there on the scene,''\nsaid Harrington, a Bradley supporter. ``People are looking for a\nfresh face.''\n\n   ``I don't think that anybody is specifically against Gore; there\nis no sense of animus. But there is definite scandal weariness out\nthere,'' said Shannon.\n\n   Gore leads Bradley in the national fund-raising competition,\ncollecting $19.5 million to Bradley's $11.7 million. But Bradley's\nsupporters find solace in the Gore campaign's spending habits.\nBradley has been far more frugal, having spent $4.3 million,\ncompared with $8.2 million spent by Gore.\n\n   ``They can't help themselves.
