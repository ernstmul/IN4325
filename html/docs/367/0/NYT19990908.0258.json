Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ Under the scaffolding on the southwest corner of\nFulton and Nassau Streets in lower Manhattan the other day, a man\nat a folding table tried to entice passers-by with what has become\nan increasingly common pitch: ``CDs, $5. CDs, $5.'' On the\nnorthwest corner another man offered the same deal. People crowded\naround as if someone was giving out free food.\n\n   The recordings bore the earmarks of illegally produced copies of\nlegitimate CDs. Those who buy them said they sound like the real\nthing, and in their slick packaging they resemble the CDs for sale\nin stores. But the tight-fitting plastic wrappers of the authentic\nCDs, along with the pullout sections of art and lyrics, are\nmissing.\n\n   The disks themselves have a slight blue-green tint on the bottom\nside, and they list the name of the artist _ often misspelled,\napparently in an attempt to maneuver around copyright laws _ and\nthe CD in simple block letters rather than in the logos of the\nlegitimate versions. These nondescript products have become the\nlatest vehicle for street-level music piracy, replacing cassettes\nand costing the music industry tens of millions of dollars. Recent\narrests hint at how quick the profits can be for what in all\nlikelihood are a growing number of low-cost, computer-based rings\nthat can operate out of a small basement or living room.\n\n   What's more, consumers seem quite happy with the product. ``In a\nstore, the last CD cost me $14, so this was $5,'' said Alex\nSalguero, referring to a CD by hip-hop artist Eminem that he bought\nfrom a sidewalk stand in the Wall Street area. ``For $15, I can buy\nthree on the street. And it's good quality.''\n\n   While the record industry has been concentrating most of its\nanti-piracy efforts on music that can be downloaded from the\nInternet, advancements in CD technology have opened up this new\nfront in the piracy war. It is relatively easy to produce multiple\nCD copies of high quality for little money.\n\n   Cheap graphics software allows some operators to copy album\ncovers in a way that makes their products look authentic.\n\n   Peddlers are taking advantage of the market for pop and hip-hop\nmusic. The common selection on the street includes artists like\nCher, Britney Spears, TLC and the Backstreet Boys. Popular hip-hop\nartists like Nas, Jay-Z, Puff Daddy and DMX are available at almost\nevery stand.\n\n   ``Just when we were getting our arms around the mass replication\nof counterfeit and pirate cassettes is when we started to see the\nevolution of the CD-R and CD plant piracy problem,'' said Frank\nCreighton, the director of anti-piracy operations for the Recording\nIndustry Association of America, in an interview.\n\n   On Friday the Queens district attorney and the Suffolk County\nPolice announced the arrests of 12 people in connection with a\ncounterfeit CD ring. Along with cassettes, computers, recording\nequipment and dubbing machines, authorities seized 98,000\ncounterfeit CDs. Officials called it the largest one-time\nconfiscation of counterfeit CDs in the nation.\n\n   In making the announcement with the authorities, the Recording\nIndustry Association of America, representing record companies,\nestimated that the Queens and Suffolk ring was taking more than\n$100 million a year from legitimate sales.\n\n   In 1986, three years after CDs were introduced in the United\nStates, record companies had to decide if it was worth investing\n$25 to $30 million to open a factory to manufacture them. Now, for\nan investment as low as $180, anyone can walk into a computer store\nand buy a small CD copier, called a CD burner, to accompany a\ncomputer. Larger CD burners that can make multiple copies are\navailable through the Internet for roughly $3,000. The burners,\nmade by major electronics companies, copy CDs onto blank disks\ncalled CD-recordables or CD-Rs through a digital process that\nmaintains the quality of the recording. The CD-Rs sell for $1 each\nin retail stores.\n\n   With this technology available, pirates can set up CD factories\nin living rooms. A street-corner peddler in lower Manhattan, who\nreadily acknowledged that his merchandise was pirated, said one of\nhis suppliers copies ``thousands and thousands of CDs'' in a tiny\noffice space packed with CD burners. ``It's like having a room\nfilled with rack stereo systems,'' he said.\n\n   This salesman, in his late 30s, said he works for a middleman\nwho deals directly with a supplier. The suppliers generally don't\nsell CDs themselves, he said, because ``they're too busy burning\nCDs.''\n\n   Data released in August show that 155,496 pirated CDs had been\nseized by law enforcement officials tipped off by the Recording\nIndustry Association in the first half of 1999, up from 23,858 for\nthe same period in 1998.\n\n   ``We've seen the shift from the counterfeit cassette rings to\nthe CD-R rings,'' said Creighton of the RIAA.\n\n   With cassettes, however, reproduction quality was not very good.\n\n   ``There definitely were quality control issues in the cassette\narena that don't exist in the CD arena,'' Creighton said.\n\n   In July, authorities in Prince George's County, Md., seized\nnearly 59,000 CDs. Police described the action as the end of a\ncounterfeiting ring that involved illegal videos and CDs that were\nproduced in New York and shuttled to the Washington area for sale.\n\n   The RIAA is developing encrypting technology that it hopes will\ncurb the production of pirated music by preventing it from being\nplayed on the next generation of audio equipment. But the new\ntechnology may not eliminate the law enforcement difficulties.\n\n   In New York, peddlers have the appearance of legitimacy because\nthey often have permits for sidewalk sales of legal goods. In some\nspots, the trade is so stable that vendors accept returns or\nexchanges from regulars. One customer who works for a private\ndelivery service pulled up recently to a table on Houston and\nVarick Streets in Greenwich Village and handed the CD peddler a\nrecording by Latino pop artist Manny Manuel, saying it skipped.
