It doesn't have to. This ship's quarry comes to\nit.\n\n   Gamblers come to Treasure Bay from all over, from all walks of\nlife: denim-clad locals and fur-wrapped visitors, twentysomethings\nand octogenarians, blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians, all eager\nto unload their doubloons within the hulking vessel.\n\n   A few hunker over lush felt tables manned by sharply dressed\npirates' minions, whose hands blur in a hypnotic flurry of\ncard-fanning, dice dispensing and chip-scooping. Many more belly up\nto endless rows of slot machines, which pulsate and ping with\nelectronic lights and bells and have seductive names such as\n``Sizzling 7'' and ``Filthy Rich.''\n\n   Occasionally, the fortunate ``win'' back a few coins. And then\nproceed to fork over even more cash in the hope of getting\n``lucky'' again.\n\n   That human instinct is at the heart of this once-depressed Gulf\nCoast city's multibillion dollar gaming industry, which has\naccounted for more than 12,000 new jobs. Since gambling was\nlegalized here in 1992, nine mammoth casino-resort properties have\nopened, and more are on the way. In six years, the number\nofvisitors has leapt from 1.5 million to 19 million per year. And\nthis crowded field is about to be joined by an even bigger player.\n\n   You've probably already seen the commercial. Over pastoral\nimages of children swinging, seagulls gliding and shrimp boats\nlisting in a placid harbor, a plummy, faux-Scarlett O'Hara voice\n(supplied by Elizabeth Taylor) drawls, ``And then, one day, it\nhappened. You looked up and there it was! Just like a storybook,\nwritten large across the sky. . . . And after that, nothing was\never the same. 'Course, we still like the smell of the magnolias.''\n\n   What has ``happened'' is Beau Rivage, Biloxi's newest and\narguably grandest casino-resort, which opens Tuesday. The ad\nepitomizes the balancing-act marketing plan behind this $650\nmillion, 32-story behemoth.\n\n   Built by Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts Inc., Beau Rivage aims\nto be a posh, five-star retreat with a Deep South flavor. It\noutsizes the competition in nearly every way, with nearly 1,800\nhotel rooms _ compared to 1,088 at the second-largest Imperial\nPalace _ plus 12 restaurants, a 30-slip marina, a full-service spa\nand a 1,550-seat theater that will offer ongoing performances by\nthe avant-garde circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. Yet, for all its\nlook-at-me largeness, Beau Rivage is less garish than neighboring\ncasino-resorts. The muted color scheme is heavy on pastel yellows.\nTaylor's favorite trees, magnolias, even shade the lobby. And the\ncasino itself is a forest of floral prints and fringe.\n\n   All the better to attract the target customer: affluent women\nfrom out of state. Barry Shier, 43, chief executive officer of Beau\nRivage Resort, says states such as Georgia, Florida and Texas boast\n``a level of affluence'' higher than Mississippi's.\n\n   Demographic studies show that the typical visitor to the Gulf\nCoast is female, over 45 and college-educated. It remains to be\nseen whether Biloxi's working-class male visitors will take to Beau\nRivage and its nicotine-distressed murals, sushi bar and\naromatherapy chambers.\n\n   Hitting the jackpot\n\n   Deep within the bowels of Treasure Bay, Wonverlette Miller is on\na roll. The 29-year-old nurse's assistant from Hilton Head, S.C.,\nhas just scored a ``double jackpot'' on her slot machine, which is\nspewing a slew of quarters into her waiting hand.\n\n   ``There's no skill to it,'' she tells an amazed onlooker. ``You\njust sit down and play.''\n\n   He does, feeding an adjoining machine with a roll of quarters.\nWithin four minutes, he's down to one quarter.\n\n   ``What did you do?'' asks Miller, aghast. ``You must have done\nsomething wrong.''\n\n   Winners and losers. It has become Biloxi's story.\n\n   Such dizzying growth in so short a time has made some in the\ncity of 53,000 giddy with newfound prosperity. Others feel that\ntheir simple way of life has been lost to the pirates forever.\n\n   The late 1980s and early '90s were dire times in Biloxi. The\ncity, with its 26 miles of man-made beaches and picturesque\nantebellum homes, had been for decades a popular getaway spot for\nNew Orleans' upper crust. But when Louisiana's oil industry hit the\nskids in the late 1970s, money grew scarce and the vacationers\nstayed away. The hotels started to fall into disrepair. Other\ntravelers bypassed Biloxi for beach towns in Alabama and the\nFlorida Panhandle. The city began to have trouble paying its bills.\n``We couldn't even afford to buy tires for the police cars,'' says\nVincent Kreel, Biloxi's public affairs manager.\n\n   In the late '80s, several states in the Midwest and South hit\nthe jackpot with limited legalized gambling. In 1990, the\nMississippi Legislature cleared the way for the counties along the\nMississippi River and the Gulf Coast to offer dockside gambling.\nThe idea was to keep things small, with a historic riverboat feel,\nso as not to insult the conservative Christian sensibilities of\nmany residents. Early on, one gaming official took pains to point\nout in the Mississippi Business Journal that the combined square\nfootage of the dozens of casino boats then docked in Mississippi\nwas only as large as two Las Vegas casinos.\n\n   ``People thought the industry would last maybe three or four\nyears,'' Shier says. But when gamblers began descending on the area\nin droves, the casinos permanently dropped anchor. The riverboats\nwere replaced by immobile gaming barges and seamlessly fused with\nland-based hotel and restaurant facilities. And gaming revenue\nbecame an inextricable part of Biloxi's economy.\n\n   Rising rents, robberies\n\n   Ask any number of Biloxi's merchants and they'll invariably say\nthe casinos have been good for business. Then, almost immediately,\nthey'll start talking about the downside.\n\n   Everybody mentions the traffic.\n\n   ``Used to be, you could shoot a cannon down Beach Boulevard and\nnot hit anybody,'' says one restaurant owner, referring to Biloxi's\noceanfront thoroughfare. Others believe that crime in the area is\non the rise, pointing to a recent upturn in bank robberies.\nEscalating rents and the loss of qualified employees to the casinos\nare also concerns.\n\n   The severity of these problems is relative. Take the traffic.\nTrue, Beach Boulevard and U.S. 110, which connects the coastal\nhighway to U.S. 10 inland, can get moderately conjested. But it\nisn't exactly Atlanta's Spaghetti Junction during afternoon rush\nhour.\n\n   The city plans to combat traffic congestion by building a\n3.5-mile loop around downtown and another connector in West Biloxi,\nsays David Nichols, Biloxi's chief administrative officer. As for\ncrime, he acknowledges that bank robberies are on the rise, but the\noverall crime rate has fallen, he says, thanks to a burgeoning\npolice force funded by gaming tax revenues.\n\n   But nobody has a solution for skyrocketing rents, which are\npricing some mom-and-pop operations out of high-profile beachfront\nspots.\n\n   Buzz and Bobbie Winnett pay $3,000 a month rent for their small\nbeachfront boutique, Bobbie's Bikinis, up from around $800 a month\nin the early '90s. Their business has improved slightly every year,\nthanks to an influx of young women employed by the casinos as\ncocktail waitresses. But if the rent continues to rise, the\nWinnetts may have to move inland.\n\n   Small pawnshops, which can be seen as barnacles on the boat that\nis gambling, are thriving. Mark Millette, owner of Beach Pawn &\nGun, set up shop six years ago and has seen his business grow 10 to\n15 percent annually. Thanks to his largely local customer base,\nMillette is well-stocked with hocked jewelry, guns and stereos. ``I\njust saw all the people coming to the area,'' he says. ``And I\nthought, `Hey, whether you have a pawnshop or a Ruby Tuesday's,\nthings are going to be good.' ''\n\n   He's not just talking. There's a new, double-decker Ruby\nTuesday's just down the block. The wait for a table on Saturday\nnights: an hour or more.\n\n   `A laissez-faire view'\n\n   Scott Carter has the kind of energetic, up-with-people\npersonality common to young Southern ministers. He says\n``wonderful'' a lot when preaching to the Leggett Memorial United\nMethodist Church. ``Isn't it a wonderful day?'' he says to his\ncongregation of a year. ``It's wonderful to have y'all here.''\n\n   But on the first Sunday in Lent, he's sermonizing passionately\nabout the need to ``examine ourselves'' in order to guard against\n``unhealthy appetites.'' He never mentions gambling directly.\n\n   ``I sometimes talk about it, but I never rail against it,''\nCarter, 37, says later. He understands that many who attend\nservices at the small beachfront church have, in his words, ``a\nlaissez-faire view'' of the local gaming industry. Some have even\nfound jobs in the casinos.\n\n   His own feelings are unequivocal. ``I'm personally opposed to\nit,'' Carter says. ``There's no question that it's rejuvenated the\ncoast, but I guess I see the underside of it.'' He ministers to the\nhomeless at a shelter in downtown Biloxi and says he sees plenty of\n``personal destruction and despair'' caused by addictive gambling.\n\n   Others in Mississippi's religious community are even more vocal\nin their opposition to the casinos. Last year, legislative aide\nElizabeth Stoner, with the support of religious groups, tried to\nforce a statewide vote on gambling. A judge rejected the initiative\nbecause it did not address what effect a ``no'' vote would have on\nthe state's economy. Gaming taxes now account for 10 percent of\nMississippi's annual budget.\n\n   And, to Carter, that's the rub. ``Many of my fellow pastors\noppose gambling, but now that it's here, they don't want to see it\ntaken away,'' he says. ``Our economy is tied to it. And that's a\nbig concern.''\n\n   A bonanza in quarters\n\n   Over at the Boomtown Casino, which looks from the outside like a\nslice of Walt Disney World's Main Street, George Bowling dispenses\nadvice on how to win at the slots. ``It doesn't matter which\nmachine you play,'' he says. ``They're all the same. The only thing\nthat matters is that you stick with it.''\n\n   The 51-year-old retired infantryman from Columbus, Ga., knows\nwhat he's talking about. He's popped down to the casino for a few\nminutes while his wife dresses for dinner, and he's already $100\nahead.\n\n   Another gambler, a reporter hopeful of understanding the lure,\nif not getting on a roll of his own, wasn't faring as well. One\nroll of quarters was gobbled up by a slot machine called Treasure\nWheel.\n\n   He tried again.\n\n   The first of the machine's spinning reels stopped on a bar. So\ndid the second. Then the final reel landed on a super-fancy\nTreasure Wheel bar. The machine began to flash and ping. Quarters\nspilled out at a breathtaking rate.\n\n   He cashed out, admiring his winnings _ $14 _ and walked out of\nthe casino.\n\n   As pirate spoils go, it wasn't much. But it felt like a million\nbucks.\n\n   Doug Hamilton writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   BILOXI, Miss. _ As big as an ocean liner and bathed in a ghostly\nblue light, the pirate ship sits a few hundred feet offshore.\n","\n   It doesn't move.
