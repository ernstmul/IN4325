The civil suits, filed Tuesday, also claim the\ncompanies loaded unauthorized versions of Microsoft software onto\nhard disks of PCs they sold.\n\n   The companies can face penalties of up to $100,000 for software\nproducts sold, regardless of how many copies. CompuTime\nInternational, accused of selling illegal copies of Windows 95,\nWindows 98 and Office Professional 97, could face up to $1 million\nin fines, $100,000 each for the Windows products and $100,000 for\nthe eight programs included in the Office Professional suite.\n\n   People who bought the allegedly counterfeit software from the\ncompanies would not be liable for any of the damages or eligible\nfor any award given to Microsoft. A Microsoft spokesman said the\ncompany would give customers a letter to bolster their case for a\nrefund from the stores.\n\n   The companies' owners, none of whom returned callsThursday, have\n20 days to respond to the complaints. None of the companies is an\nauthorized distributor of Microsoft products. A ruling could take\nup to a year.\n\n   Nick Psyhogeos, a Microsoft corporate attorney based in\nWashington, said Microsoft is stepping up its efforts to combat the\nillegal use of its software. The company started a television and\nbillboard anti-piracy advertising campaign in Georgia in May.\n\n   Piracy is widespread, the company claims. Microsoft estimates\nthat one of every five software programs being used in Georgia was\nillegally obtained, most by small- to medium-sized businesses. In\n1998, the Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group, collected\n$10 million in fines from companies using software for which they\ndid not have licenses.\n\n   ``Our view is that these companies knew what they were doing and\nthey willfully ignored our requests that they refrain from that\nconduct,'' he said. Psyhogeos said half of any settlement will be\ngiven to local charities focused on teaching kids technology and\ntoward technology training for displaced workers.\n\n   Psyhogeos said Microsoft learns of companies selling pirated\nsoftware or businesses using counterfeit versions from people who\ncall its toll-free anti-piracy number, 1-800-RULEGIT. Then they\nhire a private detective to conduct a ``test purchase'' at a\nsuspected business.\n\n   In the case of Microseconds, Microsoft claims that it twice\nbought PCs with pirated copies of Windows 95 installed, in\nSeptember and in April. After the September purchase, Psyhogeos\nsaid Microsoft sent Microseconds a letter asking it to stop selling\nthe counterfeit product. Then last month, Microsoft said it bought\ncomponents of the 1997 version of its Office Pro software that\nproved to be counterfeit. Office Pro includes several components,\nincluding a word processor and a spreadsheet.\n\n   Microseconds owner Steven Brandt was among the owners who could\nnot be reached.\n\n   Psyhogeos said consumers sometimes can tell if they are buying\npirated software because the user manual, license agreement and\nwarranty card will be missing.\n\n   He said Microsoft is most interested in finding out where the\nretailers get their counterfeit product.\n\n   One such source was shut down in June.\n\n   Police in Southern California arrested an eight-person operation\nusing a $1.2 million machine to copy 15,000 Microsoft software\nprograms a month.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ Microsoft filed suit this week in federal court\nagainst five Atlanta area companies, claiming the computer hardware\nand software retailers are selling pirated products.\n","\n   Microsoft said the companies _ Microseconds in Duluth; Atlanta\nComputer and CompuTime International, both in Norcross; Tierra\nComputer of Doraville; and Net-Sol, in Hall County _ sold illegal\nversions of its software products to undercover detectives working\nfor Microsoft.\n","\n   The software included Windows 95, Windows 98 and Office\nProfessional 97.
