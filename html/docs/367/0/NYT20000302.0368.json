Stiles, the little boy who had no toys but grew up\nto become Santa Claus _ and run an eccentric antiques business that\nlet growing children exchange their old ice skates for somebody\nelse's bigger ones _ died Tuesday at a New Jersey convalescent\nhome. He was 89.\n\n   Stiles, who had a long, flowing beard and white hair, lived what\nwas, by all accounts, a magical life. Neighbors came to treasure\nthe sight of him and his wife, Emma, taking their weekly two-hour\nrides in an old-fashioned horse-drawn carriage from their home and\nshop in Meyersville, a hamlet on the outskirts of Chatham Township\nin southern Morris County, N.J.\n\n   At Christmas time, they would put on cherry-red costumes to be\nMr. and Mrs. Claus.

Enclosed within six sheds, pretty much collapsing on one\nanother, it telegraphs the possibility of serendipitous treasure,\nthe lure that draws millions of Americans to flea markets. In\nrecent years, foreigners eager to buy a piece of Americana have\nbeen turning up at the shop with astonishing frequency.\n\n   Why not? A Bing Crosby 45-rpm record for 50 cents here; a\nstained-glass window for $200 there; a one-of-a-kind horseshoe\nchair, handmade by a blacksmith using 90 horseshoes, a steal at\n$1,200.\n\n   Amid the thousands of hub caps and license plates, there are\neven things on display that are solemnly declared not for sale _\nexcept perhaps for the right price. These include collections of\n1940s dolls, rocking horses and 20 horse-drawn sleighs, not to\nmention the immense grouping of stuffed rabbits, each wearing a\nswimsuit and sunglasses and holding an umbrella.\n\n   And, boy, could Stiles sell his odd wares. A 1992 article in The\nNew York Times pictures him pointing and saying, ``Look at that\nelephant over there _ came from a circus that couldn't afford a\nreal one, only one of them in the world, made in the 1930s _ watch\nher eyes blink and her stomach move.''\n\n   He put it this way: ``It's all here to give people's eyeballs an\neducation. I tell people to take three steps forward and then back\nup two to see what they missed.''\n\n   But everyone would notice the pet farm. Over the years,\nresidents have included peacocks, ferrets, ducks, wild turkeys,\nrabbits, geese, turkeys, cats and a raccoon named Rebel. Charlie,\nthe crow, could bark like a dog. Well, almost: he could not\npronounce the letter B, so it came out ``wow, wow.''\n\n   As for the deer, Stiles had wanted since childhood to have at\nleast one. In the mid-1950s, he paid a $150 fee to the state to\ntake whatever the wildlife authorities would give him. He got a\nbuck and a doe, and since then, had something like three dozen in\nall.\n\n   Stiles was born in Westfield, N.J., and never had toys as a\nchild. He once speculated that that was the reason he was driven to\nacquire 60 life-size dolls and 160 teddy bears as an adult.\n\n   He ran away from home at 13, his son, George, said. He worked as\na carpenter and in a metals factory, where melting magnesium left\nholes in his skin that remained for the rest of his life. By the\nearly 1950s, he owned a luncheonette in Berkeley Heights, N.J., the\ntown where he died in the convalescent home.\n\n   In the 1950s, he met and married Emma Newman, who ran a\nfamily-owned boarding house in Meyersville. They immediately began\nto collect junk, setting the used bathroom fixtures, wagon wheels\nand the rest of it in the muddy front yard of the boarding house.\nIn 1956, the boarding house became Archie's Resale Shop, looking\nexactly like what it was, a glorified junk shop.\n\n   One winter in the late 1950s, when one manufacturer of ice\nskates had suffered a fire and another a strike, skates were hard\nto find. The Stileses, both of whom loved to skate, bought as many\nused skates as they could find.
