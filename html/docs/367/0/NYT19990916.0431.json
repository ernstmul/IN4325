Times News Service   \n\n   Forget the ``widow's walk'' _ the rooftop platform from which\npacing wives scanned the horizon for their seafaring husbands.

No, thank you.)\n\n   Technology, in the form of lighter, easier-to-control equipment,\nis the big factor in helping to send dames to sea _ and to send\nother women into all kinds of fields that also once required\nsubstantial physical strength.\n\n   Of course, deep-sea fishing can still involve strenuous work,\nlike loading 30-pound boxes of bait into the hold. But ``there's no\njob I can't do on the boat,'' said Linda Greenlaw, a 5-foot-3,\n135-pound woman who was captain of a 100-foot swordfishing vessel\nfor 16 years.\n\n   Things have certainly changed in the 70 years since Ms.\nGreenlaw's grandparents hauled in their catch by hand.

As a result, many occupational barriers\nhave fallen over the last 10 years. Women have greatly increased\ntheir presence in areas as diverse as the Forest Service,\nlong-distance trucking and construction work.\n\n   Over all, the trend has been a plus for the economy, said Paul\nSaffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research\norganization based in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The quality of the labor\nforce goes up,'' he said, ``because employers have a broader field\nfrom which to select employees.''\n\n   None of that, however, means that it is easy to run a\nsteel-hulled deep-sea fishing boat in the North Atlantic, or to\nlive with a five-member crew for 30 days at a time. Contending with\nsavage weather, equipment failure, too few fish and too many sharks\nis often done in a state of mind-numbing exhaustion: When she was\nat the helm of the swordfishing boat, it was not unusual for Ms.\nGreenlaw to work 10 consecutive 21-hour days.\n\n   And as for her all-male crews, Ms. Greenlaw says she got\nwhatever respect she was due the old-fashioned way: She earned it.\n\n   Though she has since switched to captaining a lobster boat, a\njob that, among other things, lets her return to shore each night,\nMs. Greenlaw spent those 16 years as the captain of the Hannah\nBoden, the sister ship of the Andrea Gail, which went down in the\nfreak 1991 Atlantic tempest memorialized in ``A Perfect Storm,''\nSebastian Junger's best seller (Norton).\n\n   Ms. Greenlaw recently published a memoir of her own, ``The\nHungry Ocean'' (Hyperion), that describes her life as a captain by\nfocusing on one 30-day trip in which her crew had a tremendous\ncatch _ 56,000 pounds of swordfish, kept frozen on board.\n\n   As Ms. Greenlaw is quick to note, technology on fishing boats\nhas also helped to tip the odds against Moby Dick. Electronic\nnavigation systems make it easier to find fish than it was when\nfishermen ``had a sixth sense or could feel when conditions were\nright and where the fishing was good.'' she said.\n\n   On the swordfishing boat, she had a color sounder, Doppler\ncurrent indicator and surface temperature gauges. Her fax machine\ncranked out updated weather maps. So much for ``red sky at night,\nsailors' delight/red sky in morning, sailors take warning.''\n\n   In addition to leveling the ocean for women, technology is\nhelping all fishermen by minimizing the kind of injuries that could\nsink a career.\n\n   ``Years ago,'' Ms. Greenlaw said, ``a guy would have a bad back\nby the age of 30.'' Proof of the new staying power is James\nGreenlaw, Linda's father, who at 69 regularly fills in as captain\non her lobster boat.\n\n   Advanced communication systems have also improved the safety\nmargin for deep-sea fishing.
