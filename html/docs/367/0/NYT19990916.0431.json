Times News Service   \n\n   Forget the ``widow's walk'' _ the rooftop platform from which\npacing wives scanned the horizon for their seafaring husbands. Now\nit's the women who might well be taking to the high seas as\nfishermen. (Fisherwomen? Fisherpeople? No, thank you.)\n\n   Technology, in the form of lighter, easier-to-control equipment,\nis the big factor in helping to send dames to sea _ and to send\nother women into all kinds of fields that also once required\nsubstantial physical strength.\n\n   Of course, deep-sea fishing can still involve strenuous work,\nlike loading 30-pound boxes of bait into the hold. But ``there's no\njob I can't do on the boat,'' said Linda Greenlaw, a 5-foot-3,\n135-pound woman who was captain of a 100-foot swordfishing vessel\nfor 16 years.\n\n   Things have certainly changed in the 70 years since Ms.\nGreenlaw's grandparents hauled in their catch by hand. Back then,\nevery task from pulling up anchor to bringing in a 500-pounder was\nperformed manually.\n\n   Today, with all the hydraulics and electronics aboard commercial\nfishing boats, most of the backbreaking work is eliminated.\n\n   ``If you can open a doorknob, then you have the physical\nstrength to operate a boat,'' said Ms. Greenlaw, 38, from her home\non Isle au Haut, off the coast of Maine. ``You need only turn a\nhandle, press a button or open a valve to do all the lifting,\nlugging and tugging that used to be done by hand.''\n\n   In fact, in most equipment-intensive lines of work, brawn has\nbecome secondary to brains; no longer must workers be able to\nbench-press their weight. As a result, many occupational barriers\nhave fallen over the last 10 years. Women have greatly increased\ntheir presence in areas as diverse as the Forest Service,\nlong-distance trucking and construction work.\n\n   Over all, the trend has been a plus for the economy, said Paul\nSaffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research\norganization based in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The quality of the labor\nforce goes up,'' he said, ``because employers have a broader field\nfrom which to select employees.''\n\n   None of that, however, means that it is easy to run a\nsteel-hulled deep-sea fishing boat in the North Atlantic, or to\nlive with a five-member crew for 30 days at a time. Contending with\nsavage weather, equipment failure, too few fish and too many sharks\nis often done in a state of mind-numbing exhaustion: When she was\nat the helm of the swordfishing boat, it was not unusual for Ms.\nGreenlaw to work 10 consecutive 21-hour days.\n\n   And as for her all-male crews, Ms. Greenlaw says she got\nwhatever respect she was due the old-fashioned way: She earned it.\n\n   Though she has since switched to captaining a lobster boat, a\njob that, among other things, lets her return to shore each night,\nMs. Greenlaw spent those 16 years as the captain of the Hannah\nBoden, the sister ship of the Andrea Gail, which went down in the\nfreak 1991 Atlantic tempest memorialized in ``A Perfect Storm,''\nSebastian Junger's best seller (Norton).\n\n   Ms. Greenlaw recently published a memoir of her own, ``The\nHungry Ocean'' (Hyperion), that describes her life as a captain by\nfocusing on one 30-day trip in which her crew had a tremendous\ncatch _ 56,000 pounds of swordfish, kept frozen on board.\n\n   As Ms. Greenlaw is quick to note, technology on fishing boats\nhas also helped to tip the odds against Moby Dick. Electronic\nnavigation systems make it easier to find fish than it was when\nfishermen ``had a sixth sense or could feel when conditions were\nright and where the fishing was good.'' she said.\n\n   On the swordfishing boat, she had a color sounder, Doppler\ncurrent indicator and surface temperature gauges. Her fax machine\ncranked out updated weather maps. So much for ``red sky at night,\nsailors' delight/red sky in morning, sailors take warning.''\n\n   In addition to leveling the ocean for women, technology is\nhelping all fishermen by minimizing the kind of injuries that could\nsink a career.\n\n   ``Years ago,'' Ms. Greenlaw said, ``a guy would have a bad back\nby the age of 30.'' Proof of the new staying power is James\nGreenlaw, Linda's father, who at 69 regularly fills in as captain\non her lobster boat.\n\n   Advanced communication systems have also improved the safety\nmargin for deep-sea fishing. Should all else fail, Ms. Greenlaw\nsaid, a sophisticated radio ``immediately transmits the name of my\nvessel and exact position to the Coast Guard.''  \n\n   But technology hasn't solved the road warrior problem _ or ocean\nwarrior problem _ of the industry: Women and men with their sights\nset on raising a family generally prefer not to be away from home\nfor extended periods.\n\n   Of course, the long trips don't help in finding a partner,\neither.\n\n   ```Thanks for dinner, see you in 30 days' is not exactly a\nrelationship-builder,'' explained Ms. Greenlaw, who is single.\n\n   But men who don't share her craving for adventure and deep\nrespect for the sea probably need not apply. ``I love being on a\nboat out in the middle of the ocean,'' she said. ``Even if I was\npregnant, I'd have no problem going out.''\n\n   Like any successful fisherman, however, she will take only\nsensible risks. ``Well, maybe the final few weeks'' of that\npregnancy, she said, ``I wouldn't go out on a long trip.''\n","Headline":"\nCAPTAIN OF HER FATE IN ANY SEAS  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 19) \n","Text":["\n   Forget the ``widow's walk'' _ the rooftop platform from which\npacing wives scanned the horizon for their seafaring husbands.
