Times News Service    \n\n   HONG KONG _ If you wanted to be the first on your block in New\nYork to see the new ``Star Wars'' film, you had to line up three\ndays in advance for tickets or buy them from scalpers for $100\napiece.\n\n   If you want to be first on the block in Hong Kong, you just have\nto duck into a seedy shopping arcade in Kowloon, where you can pick\nup the most eagerly awaited film in history for less than $3.\n\n   Illegal videotaped copies of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The\nPhantom Menace'' are doing a brisk business throughout Asia, barely\na week after it opened in the United States and more than a month\nbefore it is to open here.\n\n   The illicit copying of Hollywood films is such a pervasive\nproblem that industry executives took it for granted that ``Phantom\nMenace'' would turn up here on video compact disc. But the warp\nspeed with which it flew from American cinemas to Asian streets has\nleft people whipsawed.\n\n   ``Boy, that didn't take long,'' said Barbara Robinson, the\nmanaging director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia. She\nadded, ``It would have been naive to think that ``Star Wars''\nwouldn't have been pirated.''\n\n   Most major films from the United States are illegally copied and\nsold within a week of their release. ``Phantom Menace'' set a\ndubious record, according to industry experts, with copies hitting\nthe streets in Malaysia two days after the release. They have since\nturned up in Singapore, Indonesia, Macau and Hong Kong, where the\nmovie does not open until July 1.\n\n   ``This is not some small fly-by-night organization doing one-off\ncopies; this is a very well-organized international conspiracy,''\nsaid Rigo Jesu, the managing director of Intercontinental Film\nGroup, a local film distributor.\n\n   The latest chapter of the ``Star Wars'' saga is considered such\na juggernaut that most industry executives said illegal knockoffs\nwould not doom it at the box office _ as it has done to some Asian\nfilms. But the abysmal quality of the copies could drive potential\ncustomers away, these people said.\n\n   Piracy experts said the copies were probably produced by someone\nwho surreptitiously filmed the movie off the screen of a theater in\nthe United States. In a copy that was playing in the arcade, the\nbobbing heads of moviegoers, including a man's bald pate, obscured\nthe bottom of the picture.\n\n   ``It's not good for the movie, and it hurts video sales if\neveryone already owns a copy,'' said Sam Ho, the director of the\nanti-piracy division at the Motion Picture Association, a trade\ngroup that represents Hollywood studios, including 20th Century\nFox, which is distributing ``Phantom Menace.''\n\n   Executives at 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp., did not\nreturn calls.\n\n   Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm Ltd., the company founded\nby the ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, said in a statement that\nthe latest film ``is not unique in suffering the problems of\npiracy.''\n\n   ``Piracy throughout the world is an extremely serious problem\nfor the whole motion picture industry,'' he added.\n\n   Radley said Motion Picture Association officials had been\n``extremely aggressive in combating any piracy in any way they can;\nhowever, without the support of local governments and authorities\nit's difficult to overcome this problem.''\n\n   The purloining of movies is a flashpoint in trade relations\nbetween the United States and several Asian countries. Hong Kong\nwas removed from a watch list by the United States in February\nafter it intensified efforts to raid factories that produce\nillegally copied material. But other Asian countries, including\nIndonesia and Singapore, are on the list of copyright violators.\n\n   The surge of piracy also alarms filmmakers here, who say that it\nis strangling the region's once-thriving movie industry. The\nbox-office revenue of Hong Kong films declined from $168 million in\n1993 to $54 million last year _ largely because of the blizzard of\nbootleg copies, according to executives.\n\n   ```Star Wars' happens to be a massive phenomenon,'' Jesu said.\n``But piracy can devastate a more run-of-the-mill movie.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The Hong Kong Customs Department has assigned 250 officers to\nraid shops that sell illegal material, and said it would add\nanother 48 this year. ``We don't care what the movie title is,''\nsaid a spokesman, Richard Law. ``We are carrying out actions every\nday to enforce laws on pirated films.''\n\n   But piracy is so profitable that it seems to defy even the most\nvigilant efforts. In the case of ``Phantom Menace,'' studio\nexecutives were so nervous about illegal copies that they warned\neven reviewers for news organization not to record the film at an\nadvanced screening.\n\n   Lucas had also taken extraordinary security measures to prevent\nprints of the movie from leaking out. Yet industry executives said\nthat in the last two days, a higher-quality copy of the film had\nturned up in stores and that the copy might have been reproduced\nfrom a print.\n\n   Part of the problem is the lag time between the release of films\nin the United States and overseas. Executives said the delay was\ncaused by the difficulty of running simultaneous marketing\ncampaigns. Studios have tried to close the gap in recent years,\nnotably in 1997, when the James Bond film ``Tomorrow Never Dies''\nopened on the same day around the world.\n\n   An even bigger hurdle is the low price. Video compact discs sell\nfor $20 (Hong Kong), or about $2.58 (United States). Customers can\nbuy a package of six for $100 (Hong Kong), or $12.90 (United\nStates), and choose from other new releases like ``The Matrix,''\n``Entrapment,'' and ``The Mummy.''\n\n   ``People line up overnight in the States to see this,'' said a\nshopkeeper, waving a copy of ``Phantom Menace'' that came with\nChinese subtitles. ``Have you seen it yet? You can have it for only\n20.''\n\n   The shopkeeper said he was selling 200 copies a day, which made\n``Phantom Menace'' a popular choice but not his top seller. That\ntitle belonged to ``The Ring,'' a Japanese horror film that was\nselling 500 copies a day.\n\n   There is still hope that Lucas' epic fantasy will draw people\ninto theaters. Two young women who were browsing through the\nshelves of illegal copies stopped to look at ``Phantom Menace,''\nbut moved on. ``I'm not going to buy it,'' said Janice Ng, 25.\n``I'll save this one for the theater.''\n","Headline":"\n`STAR WARS' SAGA IS JUST ANOTHER PIRATE STORY IN ASIA \n","Text":["\n   HONG KONG _ If you wanted to be the first on your block in New\nYork to see the new ``Star Wars'' film, you had to line up three\ndays in advance for tickets or buy them from scalpers for $100\napiece.\n","\n   If you want to be first on the block in Hong Kong, you just have\nto duck into a seedy shopping arcade in Kowloon, where you can pick\nup the most eagerly awaited film in history for less than $3.\n","\n   Illegal videotaped copies of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The\nPhantom Menace'' are doing a brisk business throughout Asia, barely\na week after it opened in the United States and more than a month\nbefore it is to open here.\n","\n   The illicit copying of Hollywood films is such a pervasive\nproblem that industry executives took it for granted that ``Phantom\nMenace'' would turn up here on video compact disc.
