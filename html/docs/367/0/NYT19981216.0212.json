But traditional Judaism is less a system of belief\nthan a way of living, an orthopraxy that tends to convert people\nfor emotional rather than intellectual reasons. David Klinghoffer,\nwho edits the Books, Arts, and Manners section of National Review,\nis an exception. For him, the heart of the matter is: Is Judaism\ntrue? All else is secondary.\n\n   From an early age, Klinghoffer displayed a religious\nsensibility. The adopted child of a well-to-do Los Angeles dentist\nand his wife, he took Judaism a good deal more seriously than was\ncustomary in the Reform Jewish milieu in which he was raised. As an\nadolescent, he experimented with tefillin -- the leather-strapped\nboxes that traditional Jews don in obedience to Deuteronomy 6:8\n(``and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes''). He began to be\ntroubled that his circumcision was not ritually correct, and sought\nto remedy the situation by immersing himself in a bathtub and, in\nline with Orthodox teaching, drawing a drop of blood from the tip\nof his penis with a straight razor. There are two more\nre-circumcisions -- first by a Conservative, then by an Orthodox,\nmohel -- before he is satisfied that he truly is a Jew.\nKlinghoffer's spiritual journey winds through undergraduate years\nat Brown University, a summer at the Jewish Theological Seminary, a\npassionate love affair with a Roman Catholic woman and the\ndiscovery of his birth mother -- a Swedish Christian who picked out\nJewish parents for her son. The son comes across as an agreeable\nyoung man, open about his shortcomings, modest about his spiritual\naccomplishments, un-self-righteous.\n\n   Not that he pulls many punches. He has no kind words for the\nliberal Judaism of his youth, describing the Reform movement as ``a\nthing entirely of this world.'' He cuts Conservative Judaism a\nlittle more slack, but still writes it off as ``untenable.'' A\nJewish pluralist he is not. He is fixed on molding himself to\ndivine truth, and, as he sees it, that means adopting the belief\nthat God handed down both the Pentateuch and all rabbinical law\n(the ``oral Torah'') to Moses on Mount Sinai. As David Weiss\nHalivni has shown, this fundamentalistic account of tradition arose\nrelatively late in Jewish history, but since the Middle Ages it has\nbeen embraced ever more fervently by Orthodox rabbinical authority.\nTo say that it rejects modern scholarly understandings of the\ncomposition of the Bible and the Talmud is to say the obvious.\n\n   Klinghoffer reasons that if the God of the Hebrew Bible is\nincapable of guaranteeing the purity of revelation then He is not\nthe Almighty God He claims to be, and is in fact no God at all.\nThat God might permit corruptions of the tradition, like other\nforms of evil, is intolerable, as is the view that extrabiblical\nJewish law is the result not of direct revelation but of scriptural\nexegesis by fallible human beings.\n\n   If Klinghoffer's adherence to the inerrancy of Torah is\ntraditional, his unconcern for Jewry as such is distinctive. He has\nnothing to say about the Holocaust or the state of Israel. He\nattacks Jewish tribalism, including the self-satisfied subculture\nof some birthright Orthodox, and takes a poke at Irving Kristol and\nWilliam Safire for advocating Jewish education without subscribing\nto Jewish truth. That the covenant was made with the entire Jewish\ntribe doesn't seem to concern him. Jewish survival should be solely\na function of belief. With his convert's zeal, David Klinghoffer\nhas issued a prophetic challenge.
