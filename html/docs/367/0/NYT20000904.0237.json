Times News Service   \n\n   Tuesday ends the second straight summer travel season of chronic\nflight delays and cancellations across the United States, and\ndespite spending billions of dollars and repeated warnings in the\nlast decade of impending air traffic gridlock, there is no solution\nin sight.\n\n   Most experts now believe that delays, which have risen nearly 50\npercent during the last five years, will become worse, not better.\n\n   The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic\nsystem, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will\nrise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70 percent of that increase is\nexpected to occur at the country's 28 largest airports.\n\n   ``I don't think there is anything on the drawing board right now\nthat you can say with any credibility is the answer,'' said Kenneth\nMead, the inspector general of the Transportation Department,\nparent agency of the FAA.\n\n   ``We wish there was a silver bullet,'' said Jane Garvey, the FAA\nadministrator, ``but there is not.''\n\n   The story of how the nation's air travel system reached its\ncurrent crisis can be traced back to one of the government's most\nsuccessful economic initiatives _ airline deregulation _ and to one\nof its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the FAA's\nattempts to develop a new air traffic control system.\n\n   Airlines blame the FAA because of an antiquated air traffic\ncontrol system. The FAA counters that airlines knowingly schedule\nmore takeoffs and landings at major airports than the system can\nhandle. And both the FAA and airlines attack Congress for not\nappropriating enough money to fix the system.\n\n   ``It's gotten down to a big finger-pointing contest,'' said\nThomas Brantley, national vice president of the Professional\nAirways System Specialists, the union of technicians who maintain\nthe FAA's air traffic control equipment. ``The reality is,\neverybody's got blame to share.''\n\n   There are other factors at work, too.\n\n   Eight years of economic growth has filled airplanes to near\ncapacity, even as consumers complain about high fares. An unusual\nspate of thunderstorms this summer frequently left controllers with\nfew avenues to reroute air traffic.\n\n   The answer to air traffic control gridlock, whenever it comes,\nwill involve new technology that lets controllers track more planes\nin the sky _ and, possibly, economics that let market forces\nallocate the system's scarce resources.\n\n   TRAFFIC CONTROL IN TRANSFORMATION\n\n   A generation ago, life was much simpler for airlines and air\ntraffic controllers. Government regulators told the airlines when\nand where they could fly, and how much they could charge.\n\n   Deregulation of the industry in 1978 transformed air travel into\nmass transportation. Today, the airline industry carries three\ntimes as many passengers as it did in 1978 at average fares that\nare 40 percent lower, adjusting for inflation.\n\n   But while the industry was transformed, the air traffic control\nsystem has remained virtually unchanged. At its heart are a\ncollection of ground-based navigation beacons and radar stations\nthat divide the 3.5 million square miles of airspace over the\ncontinental United States into lanes, literal highways, along which\nmost airplanes are dispatched single file, like railroad cars.\n\n   The FAA has long stipulated that planes be separated by at least\nfive miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. That clogs the\nroutes taken by the 20,000 scheduled flights each day.\n\n   When a storm hits, controllers begin closing off individual\nhighways and spacing planes farther apart, regardless of original\nscheduling, contributing to delays on the ground.\n\n   Even when the weather is perfect, departures are not spread\nevenly throughout the day.\n\n   Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, found\nthat airlines frequently schedule flights beyond an airport's\ncapacity even in perfect weather, let alone factoring in bad\nweather.\n\n   FROM BRAINSTORM TO BOONDOOGLE\n\n   The growth in air traffic was supposed to be managed by a\nsophisticated control system that the FAA began developing in 1981.\nIn the wake of that year's air traffic controller's strike, when\n11,000 controllers were fired by President Reagan, the FAA began\nlooking for a system that could manage more traffic with fewer\ncontrollers.\n\n   What came to be known as the Advanced Automation System, was the\ncenterpiece of a 10-year, $12 billion plan to modernize air traffic\ncontrol.\n\n   It turned out to be a white elephant. In 1994, after its cost\nhad tripled, the system's capabilities were shown to be much less\nthan promised and it was still 10 years from completion, the FAA\ndecided to scale back the project. The cost, according to the\nGeneral Accounting Office, amounted to $2.8 billion.\n\n   ``The Federal Aviation Administration currently lacks the\norganizational, management, and financial wherewithal to keep pace\nwith the dynamic aviation community,'' the National Civil Aviation\nReview Commission, a panel set up by Congress, concluded in 1996.\nThe Commission also warned at the time that ``rapidly growing\ndemand combined with a reduction in capacity, as the result of\ncontinued reliance on outdated equipment, will bring our nation's\naviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century.''\n\n   nn\n\n   A NEW STRATEGY\n\n   After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the FAA\nadopted a more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control _\na strategy Garvey, the administrator since 1997, summed up as\n``build a little; test a little; deploy a little.''\n\n   The FAA replaced its old mainframe computers with newer models\nand installed color radar displays. Computer system crashes, which\nin the 1990s frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips\nof paper, are now rare.\n\n   But many problems remain.\n\n   The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air\ntraffic system are IBM models built in the 1990s that have already\ngone out of production. The FAA could not buy IBM's newest machines\nbecause they would not run the 1960s-era programming language used\nin the system's software.\n\n   The FAA also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area\nAugmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military\nsatellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable\nplanes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.\n\n   It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but it also proved much\nmore complicated _ and expensive _ than the FAA first thought.\n\n   The system was made available on a limited basis last week, but\nis not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will\nmake a significant contribution toward reducing delays.\n\n   For now, the FAA is working on deploying a series of discrete\nsystems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings\nat busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct\nroutes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing\nthe long-term growth in air traffic.\n\n   ``We know we can make some changes,'' said Steven Brown, the\nFAA's acting associate administrator for air traffic services.\n``Those will be marginal _ not unimportant, but marginal.''\n\n   REVOLUTIONIZING THE AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM\n\n   Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the\nimpending gridlock in the skies is to junk the FAA _ or junk the\neconomics on which its management of the air traffic system is\nbased.\n\n   Federal air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on\nairline tickets, cargo and fuel. Users like commercial airlines do\nnot pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small\nplanes get the same priority as jumbo jets.\n\n   ``The problem is that the resources are not priced properly,''\nsaid Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the FAA and\nseveral European countries. ``In fact, they are not priced at\nall.'' That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their\nuse of air traffic control services even at the most crowded\nairports.\n\n   For years, economists have urged the government to switch to a\nfee-based system that would force users to pay for the services\nthey use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on\nairlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to\nunderutilized secondary airports, or replace some smaller jets with\nless frequent service on bigger planes.\n\n   ``This is the unfinished business of deregulation,'' Golaszewski\nsaid. ``We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can\ndo, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity.''\n\n   Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control\nsystem needs to be separated from the FAA and handed over to a new,\nindependent entity that would operate like a business.\n\n   A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in\n1994 as part of Vice President Al Gore's campaign to reinvent\ngovernment never got out of committee, even though the House was\nstill controlled by Democrats at the time.\n\n   Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress\nduring the years, but none have made any progress.\n\n   But the FAA is already beginning to act more like a business.\nCongress passed legislation a few years ago creating a 15-member\nadvisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed this spring\ndirected the council to hire a chief operating officer to run the\nair traffic control system.\n\n   Congress also increased the FAA's budget by $10 billion during\nthe next three years to $40 billion.\n\n   Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in\nprivatization is on the rise again.\n\n   Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a\nnational air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing\nto policy makers in Washington.
