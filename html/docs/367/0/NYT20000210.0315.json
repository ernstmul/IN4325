Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ For several weeks, the Treasury bond market has been\nwhipsawed by uncertainty associated with the government's plan to\nbuy back some publicly held long-term debt with the budget surplus.\nThere have been sharp daily moves, then reversals a day later. And\ntraders say that they have often been on the wrong side of the\naction, causing painful losses for some.\n\n   Thursday, Wall Street dealers and traders indicated that they\nhad had enough. They shunned the Treasury's auction of $10 billion\nin new 30-year bonds, leaving the government with the least demand\never at such a sale. ``People didn't want the risk of participating\nbecause they didn't know where it would come out,'' said Louis\nCrandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson Associates.\n\n   Those results, and growing frustration over the signals from the\nTreasury _ even though some have been misinterpreted _ sent\nTreasury prices tumbling while yields, which move in the opposite\ndirection, shot higher.\n\n   In recent weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond, which is usually\nhigher than that on short-term securities to entice investors, has\nfallen below that of the two-year note. Then Thursday the spread\nbetween the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond\nnarrowed sharply, giving the bond market another sudden jolt.\n\n   The yield on the new 30-year bond, which was auctioned at 6.34\npercent, finished at 6.32 percent, well up from the 6.17 percent\nWednesday in the so-called when-issued market. The yield on the old\n30-year bond jumped to 6.42 percent from 6.31 percent, while the\nprice fell 1 12/32 to 96 1/32.\n\n   The yield on the two-year note rose to 6.65 percent from 6.63\npercent Wednesday. On Tuesday, the yield on the two-year note was\n6.67 percent, while the yield on the new 30-year bond was 6.10\npercent, a spread of just over half a percentage point. That spread\nhas now narrowed to a third of a percentage point.\n\n   These swift and costly swings are the result of the distortions\nthat have occurred in the market since the Treasury confirmed on\nJan. 13 that it would be buying back longer-term debt. The yield on\nthe 10-year note has also been distorted as Wall Street firms\nindicated that it would replace the 30-year bond as the market\nbenchmark.\n\n   The distortions were exacerbated last Wednesday, when a few more\ndetails about the buybacks were announced along with the news that\nthe amount of the the new 30-year bond offering, being sold\nThursday and in May, would be much smaller than expected. The\nprospect of limited supply led to panic buying last Thursday. As\nthe price rose, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.13 percent,\nfrom 6.28 percent Wednesday and then jumped back up to 6.26 percent\non Friday.\n\n   Dealers say these swings produced big losses but no one is\nowning up to them so far.\n\n   Before a Treasury auction, dealers on Wall Street usually go\nshort on the issue to be sold _ that is, in this case, they sell\n30-year bonds they own to make room for the ones they expect to buy\nwhen they bid in the auction. This assures that they do not wind up\nwith more than they want.\n\n   But because so many dealers wanted nothing to do with the new\n30-year bond, they did not go short ahead of the auction, traders\nsaid. They then made very weak bids in the auction, leaving the\nbonds to insurance companies and pension funds that need them for\ninvesting and money management purposes.\n\n   This meant that the new bond's yield soared. Just before the\nbidding closed, the yield in the when-issued market was 6.24\npercent and the yield of the auction was 6.34 percent.\n\n   ``People didn't feel confident going short,'' said Charles\nParkhurst, managing director for government bond trading at Salomon\nSmith Barney, explaining that dealers just did not want to risk\nbeing short 30-year bonds if the price suddenly took off again and\ndid not want the new bond either.\n\n   N. Graham Allen, managing director for global fixed income at\nWells Capital Management in Los Angeles, said he was not interested\nin the new 30-year bond because the trading distortions had sent\nthe yield down too low and ``we couldn't see what was going to\nmaintain that.''\n\n   Adding to the confusion Thursday were comments made on Wednesday\nby Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
