WALD   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   TORONTO _ An air traffic controller in the gleaming new tower\nhere tapped the tip of his rubber eraser at different spots on the\ntouch screen as if he were playing a xylophone, each touch making\ndata instantly pop into view, and read off arcane instructions for\na waiting Aeroflot plane. ``Atis is Golf,'' the controller,\nChristopher P. Cole, said, touching one box on the screen, which\nsuddenly showed the letter ``G.'' ``S.I.D. Bulls,'' he said,\ntouching another, which filled with a ``B.''\n\n   Barking acronyms into the microphone is standard procedure in\ncontrol towers. But entering crucial information by touch-screen\ncomputer instead of using color-coded ballpoint pens on paper\nstrips is unique to this tower, and part of a bold new experiment\nin air traffic control that is drawing increasing interest from the\nUnited States.\n\n   The interest _ from officials at U.S. airlines, the American\ncontrollers' union and the Federal Aviation Administration, among\nothers _ is not so much in the specific technology. It is mostly in\nCole's new employer, Nav Canada, the only private company in the\nworld to run a national air traffic control system, and in the new\ntechniques the company is using to bring computers and software\ninto service.\n\n   The Clinton administration has repeatedly tried to tinker with\nthe structure of the FAA, and three years ago freed the agency from\nmany federal constraints on personnel and procurement policy. Last\nyear, the administration proposed making the FAA a\n``performance-based organization'' like the Patent and Trademark\nOffice, which sets its own fees and controls its revenues, but\nCongress did not agree. Members of Congress enjoy their leverage\nover the FAA, bringing home bacon to their constituents in the form\nof instrument landing systems, new runways and the like.\n\n   Many critics say that as Congress has organized it, the agency\ncannot cope with air traffic.\n\n   Canada, by contrast, got radical. In 1996, Transport Canada, the\ngovernment agency that had run the air traffic system for decades,\nsold it to a nonprofit company created by Parliament whose\ndirectors represent airlines, general aviation, unionized workers\nand the public.\n\n   Most constituencies think the new arrangement is going well,\nthough controllers are having some second thoughts.\n\n   When the idea was introduced, controllers, who had endured a\nwage freeze for years, were eager to become employees of a private\ncompany. Airlines, upset at delays and at the government's use of\ntaxes collected on air fares for nonaviation purposes, were also\nready for change. Transport Canada was running late and over budget\non its huge modernization project _ the Canadian Automated Air\nTraffic System, or Caats _ which threatened to collapse, as a\nsimilar system did in the United States in the early 1990s.\n\n   ``It was a good move,'' said J. Clifford Mackay, president and\nchief executive of the Air Transport Association of Canada, the\nairline trade group.\n\n   The system is paid for by fees charged to planes, based mostly\non weight and distance flown. Rates have gone down because Nav\nCanada cut the payroll to 5,200 people from 6,300, mostly by laying\noff administrative workers. Controllers agreed to work an extra two\nhours a week and give more flexibility in shift scheduling; in\nexchange they got big pay increases, ranging from 17 percent to\nnearly 40 percent, keyed to the difficulty of their jobs.\n\n   The airlines say delays have been reduced. Managers who were in\nthe system when it was run by Transport Canada say it is now safer\nbecause regulation, still done by Transport Canada, is now\nindependent of operations.\n\n   ``We need look no further than Canada to see the benefits of\nprivatized air traffic control,'' said Robert A. Crandall, the\nretired chairman of American Airlines, in a recent speech on the\nproblems of the American system. A private agency, he said, has the\n``built-in incentive to spend the capital necessary to stay ahead\nof the technological curve.''\n\n   There have been missteps, including an overestimation of the\nefficiencies that privatization would allow; the number of\ncontrollers in training was cut, inducing a shortage. Mackay said\nthe company has show great agility in reversing the process with an\naggressive training and recruitment program.\n\n   The controllers' union, the Canadian Air Traffic Controllers\nAssociation, says it is reserving judgment on Nav Canada.\nControllers are happy with the pay increases but say that\nmanagement has become tougher. The union's president, Fazal Bhimji,\nsaid the number of grievances in arbitration had jumped to 80 this\nyear from 14 in 1998, adding that controllers had hoped for a more\ncollaborative system.\n\n   ``Fifty-four percent voted in favor of privatization, but if we\nhad the vote today, I'm not sure it would go through,'' he said.\n\n   But even Bhimji is impressed with the new technology. While the\nCanadian Automated Air Traffic System is still not finished,\ncompletion appears close.\n\n   Canada's problems with new technology have close parallels with\nAmerica's. Both countries have found that extensive delays in\nbringing in new computers have left them stuck with radar display\nscreens that are too old to keep running.\n\n   But Nav Canada appears to have pulled a technological rabbit out\nof a hat, developing a software patch so it can use new screens\nwith the old mainframe computers. The job was done by just five\nprogrammers, in 16 months, allowing use of a screen with color,\nbetter resolution and new features. Similar projects in the United\nStates involve scores or even hundreds of programmers, with less\nimpressive results. In fact, a parallel American project developed\na system that could not handle high traffic levels.\n\n   Nav Canada, which can hire quickly and pay competitively, did\nthe job in house, something the FAA cannot do. Managers at the\ncompany say they ignored government contracting procedures.\n\n   ``Don't tell me you have to write a document 300 pages long and\nput it in the record before you can do something,'' said Sidney\nKoslow, Nav Canada's vice president for engineering. Koslow, who\nworked for years for an FAA contractor, said Nav Canada's ``just\nget it done'' philosophy made much more sense than the FAA's\napproach.\n\n   That attitude is also helping to finish Caats, he said. The\ngovernment wanted not only to implement a modern air traffic\ncontrol system for Canada, but also to nurture a software industry\nthat could make products for export. Nav Canada left that aside.\n\n   Extricating air traffic control from politics has had other\nbenefits. The company cut overhead partly by compressing six\nregional offices into two and eliminating duplicate functions. That\nwould have made sense under the old regime too, said John W.\nCrichton, the president and chief executive, but never would have\nhappened.\n\n   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said she had\nextensive discussions with Crichton, Bhimji and others in Canada,\nas well as with officials in other countries that have established\ntheir air traffic systems as quasi-independent government agencies.\nShe expressed interest in the cost-accounting system that allows\nNav Canada to charge by flight. The FAA had tried to charge foreign\nairlines for flights over the United States, but a court blocked\nthe charges last year, ruling that the agency had no basis for\nsetting them.\n\n   Ms. Garvey said that such a predictable revenue stream and the\nability to pay competitively, two hallmarks of the Canadian system,\nwould be useful in the United States.\n\n   Nav Canada has another advantage, she said: the ability to pay\ncompetitively and thus fully staff its executive suite. (Top\nofficials at Nav Canada are paid triple what top Canadian\ngovernment bureaucrats get; with boom times for airlines in recent\nyears, the FAA has had numerous vacancies.)\n\n   Except at the top, the new Canadian system is staffed mostly\nwith the people who ran the old one, mostly in the same jobs. But,\nmanagers say, the atmosphere is different than it used to be.\n\n   ``A dollar saved by the airline is now considered a dollar saved\nby Nav Canada,'' said Joel J. Morin, manager of Nav Canada's Air\nTraffic Simulation Center, adjacent to the Ottawa airport. The\ncompany, he said, sought to run the system for the benefit of the\nusers, instead of for the convenience of the government.\n\n   He showed off a new computer system that was replaying a day's\ntraffic at Dorval Airport in Montreal at 200 times normal speed.\n\n   The system helped reorganize the whole country's air traffic\nroutes to reduce congestion and the need for controller\ninstructions to planes. It is now being used to estimate how much\nshorter certain plane routes would be if Nav Canada added several\nradars in the Arctic and opened routes over the pole to flights\nbound for Asia. Nav Canada is thus a rare bird, seeking more\ntraffic.\n\n   Transport Canada, where he worked for years, would never have\nbothered doing such an analysis, Morin said, because there was no\nobvious benefit to the government. Nav Canada did so in a\ncharacteristic way: it bought the software from an Australian\nvendor, thus saving the cost of developing it.\n\n   Cole, the controller in the Toronto tower, reflected on the\ntechnological changes as he went through his routine. He was\ndealing with layers of automation, to keep crowded runways and\nradio frequencies from bogging down. One layer was Atis, the\nAutomated Terminal Information System, a recorded announcement of\nrunway availability and weather conditions; announcing ``Atis is\nGolf'' meant that the seventh version of that recording, version\n``G,'' was the most recent.\n\n   Once, a controller would have read the announcement over and\nover. Now he simply said on the radio that version ``Golf'' was\nbeing used, and by touching the screen he could also communicate\nthat information digitally to the cockpits of properly equipped\nplanes.\n\n   Similarly, ``S.I.D. Bulls'' meant the Standard Instrument\nDeparture, the three-dimensional route the plane was to follow, was\nthe one marked ``bulls'' in the instruction book for the airport.\n\n   Previously, Cole scrawled the data out by hand, put the paper in\na plastic case and sent it on to the runway controller in what he\ncalled a ``guided fling.''\n\n   ``It's simply different, another way to do the job,'' said Cole,\nwho has been an air traffic controller for 12 years.\n\n   Ms. Garvey of the FAA is looking for a new way to handle air\ntraffic. ``Our system, while I would not say it's broken, is\ncertainly showing signs of strain,'' she said.\n\n   But she stressed that the decision was up to Congress, and\npredicted that changes would come more gradually in the United\nStates than they did in Canada.\n\n   ``Things happen here in a sort of iterative way,'' she said.\n","Headline":"\nCANADA LEADS THE WAY WITH PRIVATIZED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   TORONTO _ An air traffic controller in the gleaming new tower\nhere tapped the tip of his rubber eraser at different spots on the\ntouch screen as if he were playing a xylophone, each touch making\ndata instantly pop into view, and read off arcane instructions for\na waiting Aeroflot plane. ``Atis is Golf,'' the controller,\nChristopher P.
