Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ In what federal officials called one of the biggest\nenforcement actions in the nation's history, the federal government\nsued seven giant electric companies in the Midwest and the South on\nWednesday, accusing the utilities of defying anti-pollution\nregulations and illegally contaminating the air breathed by\nmillions of Americans.\n\n   The government took action against 32 coal-fired plants in 10\nstates, saying that if the plants reduced pollution as required it\nwould have the same effect as taking 26 million cars off the road.\n\n   The government accused the companies of modernizing their\ngenerating plants without modernizing their pollution controls as\nrequired by the Clean Air Act, which exempts many old power plants\nfrom the law's toughest requirements.\n\n   The Justice Department filed the lawsuits on behalf of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The government contends that 17\npower plants run by the companies have fouled the atmosphere for\nyears and have contributed ``to some of the most severe\nenvironmental problems facing the United States today.''\n\n   ``When children have trouble breathing because of pollution from\na utility plant hundreds of miles away, something must be done,''\nAttorney General Janet Reno said. The civil suits, which seek to\nfine the companies and force them to install modern anti-pollution\nequipment, were filed in U.S District Court in five Midwestern and\nSouthern cities.\n\n   The EPA administrator, Carol Browner, said the seven defendants\nhad committed ``very, very significant violations of the Clean Air\nAct,'' an accusation that the utilities immediately denounced.\n\n   Browner said the companies had illegally retooled old,\npollution-spewing coal plants without notifying regulators, getting\nthe necessary permits and installing expensive new equipment to\nreduce emissions and meet pollution standards that apply to new\nplants.\n\n   ``They chose not to,'' Browner said, ``because they knew that if\nthey did they'd have to reduce their pollution, and they didn't\nwant to do it.''\n\n   The utilities' motive, she added, was to prolong the lives of\nthe old plants and to avoid the cost of building new plants because\nof the tough, modern standards.\n\n   The defendants denounced the government's action. ``We regret\nthat the agency has again demonstrated that it prefers headlines\nand confrontation over consensus-building,'' said Dale Heydlauff, a\nvice president of American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. ``We\nare fully prepared to vigorously defend against these allegations,\nand we believe we will prevail.''\n\n   In addition to the lawsuits, the government took administrative\naction against the Tennessee Valley Authority, accusing the agency\nof similar violations at seven of its plants. And it issued\nviolation notices _ possible precursors to additional suits _\naccusing the seven electric utilities of pollution violations at\neight other plants.\n\n   The government's actions Wednesday are the latest volley in a\nlong-running battle over the air pollution that starts in the\nMidwest and drifts on the wind toward the highly polluted New York\nregion and on to New England. Northeastern states and the federal\ngovernment have argued that unless new controls are imposed in the\nMidwest, the chronic air pollution problems of the Northeast can\nnever be cured. But they have met mixed success in their efforts to\nsolve the problem with new air pollution regulations, which always\nend up being challenged in court.\n\n   The lawsuits brought immediate praise from environmental groups.\n``This is a major and much-needed enforcement action,'' said Frank\nO'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, in a typical\nreaction.\n\n   Whichever side prevails, it was clear Wednesday that a\nfundamental dispute is over definitions _ most importantly, the\ndifference between major renovations and ``routine maintenance.''\n\n   The Clean Air Act of 1970 sets strict standards for new\npollution sources, in this instance power plants, and much looser\nones for older sources. The older sources are ``grandfathered,''\nmeaning that they can continue to operate with relatively minor\nimprovements as long as their owners do not undertake major\nrenovations, in which case the plants are supposed to come under\nthe strict new standards.\n\n   Browner said about 100 EPA investigators working over the last\ntwo years had uncovered many instances in which the utilities had\nembarked on big capital improvements, then tried to pass them off\nas routine maintenance.\n\n   ``In one plant they spent $60 million for five new furnaces,''\nBrowner said. ``That's hardly routine maintenance.''\n\n   Or is it? Lawyers for the utilities are likely to argue that\nspending millions of dollars to improve a decades-old plant could\nbe construed as ``routine maintenance,'' especially if the\nalternative is to spend hundreds of millions on a new plant.\n\n   Peter H. Lehner, chief of the New York Attorney General's\nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, said both sides would recruit\nexperts to argue points like that. ``If it's routine maintenance,\nwe lose,'' he said. ``If it's not, they lose.''\n\n   The New York attorney general's office has been preparing\nsimilar lawsuits against some of the same defendants named in the\nfederal suits lodged Wednesday, and Lehner said his office would\nwork closely with lawyers in Washington.\n\n   Gov. George Pataki of New York welcomed the action by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. ``I hope this is only the first\nstep by the EPA to hold these power plants accountable and give New\nYorkers the protection we need and deserve from pollution\noriginating in the Midwest and Southeast,'' the governor said.\n\n   Besides American Electric Power, the defendants in the federal\nsuits are Cinergy of Cincinnati; FirstEnergy of Akron, Ohio;\nIllinois Power; Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Co.; Southern\nCompany, based in Atlanta, and the Tampa Electric Co. of Florida.\n\n   The 32 target plants are in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,\nIndiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.\nMs. Browner said she expected more plants to be cited, either in\nsuits or citations.\n\n   ``The investigation is ongoing,'' she said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Ms. Reno and Ms. Browner said the government could seek fines\namounting to millions of dollars _ $27,500 for each day in\nviolation after Jan. 30, 1997, and $25,000 for each day in\nviolation before that under the Clean Air Act.\n\n   But Ms. Browner said extracting fines was not her agency's main\ngoal. ``Our first order of business _ we just want to be very clear\nabout this _ we want the pollution out of the air,'' she said.\nLawyers familiar with the litigation predicted that some parts of\nthe suit might be settled.\n\n   The federal officials and environmentalists said the pollution\ninvolved _ blends of sulfur and nitrogen and old-fashioned soot _\nstrip leaves from trees, foul lakes and stain old copper statues.\nFar more important, they said, the pollution makes it harder for\npeople to breathe.\n\n   And while the west-to-east flow of air pollution on the\nprevailing winds can create the impression that pollution is a\nproblem foisted upon the East by people in the West, that is not\naltogether true, environmentalists have long argued. The Clean Air\nTask Force said in a statement Wednesday that Midwesterners are\nmore susceptible to pollution-related ailments than\nNortheasterners.\n\n   Ms. Browner asserted that the utilities sued Wednesday could\neffect proper anti-pollution controls by spending $3 million or $4\nmillion a year _ relatively small change when compared to the $100\nmillion or more generated by some of their power plants. Therefore,\nshe said, rates for consumers would rise only slightly.\n\n   That assertion is likely to be disputed as the cases move\nthrough the courts.
