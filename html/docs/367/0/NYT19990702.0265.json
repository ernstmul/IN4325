And the effects of the outage\nand slower back-up system rippled throughout the nation as planes\nacross the country headed for Boston, Providence, Manchester, N.H.,\nHartford, Burlington, Vt., and Portland were all told to stay put.\n\n   Flights inbound to New York from Europe were rerouted around the\naffected air space, and flights at New York's airports headed for\nEurope were also unable to take off, said FAA spokeswoman Arlene\nSalac. The Boston Center handles virtually all Europe-bound\naircraft departing from anywhere on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n   Officials could not begin to estimate the number of planes and\npeople affected, but controllers at the Boston Center _ which has\nexperienced numerous outages over the years _ said Friday's was\namong the worst.\n\n   ``This has the potential to be the most serious outage they have\never had,'' said Mike Blake, the regional vice president for the\nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association. ``It is a summer\nholiday weekend, there are thunderstorms in the area, it is a busy\ntime of day. This is a big one.''\n\n   At Logan, the scene was one of long lines, short tempers and\nplans for quick getaways for the holiday weekend vanishing with\neach tick of the clock.\n\n   ``We are going to have extensive delays,'' groaned Massport\nspokesman Jeremy Crockford. ``We are landing planes that are in the\nair, but there are holds on in other cities. Flights inbound will\nbe delayed hours.''\n\n   The only bright spot was small propeller planes flying\npassengers to and from the Cape and Islands and some northern New\nEngland destinations. They were permitted to take off because they\nfly under 10,000 feet and are not tracked by controllers in the\nBoston Center.\n\n   But even on the Cape and Islands, delays were of historic\nproportions.\n\n   Consider Nantucket Airport, which on the July 4th weekend often\nhandles as many planes as Logan Airport. Usually, planes on final\napproach to Nantucket are separated by 2.5 miles or 3 miles. Friday\nafternoon and early evening, planes flying into Nantucket were\nseparated by 35 miles, controllers said.\n\n   There were no bright spots for the controllers in the Boston\nCenter, whose job it is to maintain safe separation among planes\nhurtling across the sky at speeds that can exceed 500 miles per\nhour.\n\n   Blake said all the radar screens in the center went blank for\nabout a minute, forcing controllers to transition to the slower\nback-up system.\n\n   ``During the transition, it gets very excited. As a controller,\nit is one of those times you count on the system and when you don't\nhave it, it places you in a very uncomfortable position.''\n\n   Howard Sevey, one of the controllers who was working in the\nbuilding at the time of the lightning strike and a union\nrepresentative at the facility said ``you could feel the building\nshake. It either hit the building _ which is built like a fallout\nshelter _ or one of the antenna.''\n\n   In at least two sectors, the radar screens failed completely.\n\n   Working quickly, controllers working in sectors adjacent to\nthose who lost radar coverage, expanded their coverage area so the\nblind controllers could cobble together a working picture of the\nplanes under their responsibility.\n\n   To communicate with the planes, the controllers used a back-up\nradio system they are not familiar with. ``I've been a controller\nfor 18 years and I have never used it,'' Sevey said.\n\n   The Boston Center is one of 21 high-altitude air-traffic control\ncenters around the country operated by the FAA. Its air space\nextends north to Canada, south of Long Island, east into the\nAtlantic and west to Western New York state.\n\n   The FAA has consistently maintained that the nation's\nair-traffic system is safe because of the redundancies built into\nthe system, and while outages may cause delays, planes stay safely\nseparated because there are fewer of them in the air and the\nseparation between them is increased.\n\n   While controllers said they were not aware of any mishaps or\nclose calls because of Friday's outage, a computer outage at the\nBoston Center late last year resulted in two Europe-bound jumbo\njets nearly colliding off Long Island.
