Some gun-control supporters say the amendment is\noutdated because it was written when the country called upon\nprivate citizens to protect its interests. Those citizens, of\ncourse, would need to be armed.\n\n   There are lots of opinions that fall between those two opposing\nviewpoints. Violence in the media, poor parenting, and cultural\nattitudes all have been blamed for rampant gun violence in the\nUnited States.\n\n   Today, guns-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association\ninsist that simply enforcing the gun-control laws already on the\nbooks will lower the chances that guns fall into the wrong hands.\nThey argue that law-abiding gun owners are unjustly penalized by\nmore restrictions, and that gun-owning citizens can actually thwart\ncrime.\n\n   Supporters of stricter gun control believe that only new laws\nwill reduce deaths and injuries by firearms. They endorse measures\nsuch as waiting periods, background checks, requiring manufacturers\nto add safety locks to guns and raising the age limit at which\npeople can buy guns. Gun control advocates point to countries like\nJapan and England, where owning guns is highly regulated or\nillegal, and gun crimes are almost unheard of.\n\n   A LITTLE BACKGROUND\n\n   Congress passed the first major gun control legislation in 1968,\nin the wake of the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and\nSen. Robert Kennedy. It prohibited certain people, such as\nconvicted felons, from buying guns; set standards for gun dealers;\nand placed other restrictions on the sale and use of firearms.\n\n   In February 1994, the federal Brady law took effect. The law is\nnamed for James Brady, White House press secretary under President\nRonald Reagan who was shot in the head and partially paralyzed in\n1981, during the attempt on Reagan's life. The Brady law\nestablished a waiting period of five business days for those who\nwant to buy guns and required background checks for people buying\nguns through licensed dealers.\n\n   In December 1998, the five-day waiting period was replaced with\nan ``instant'' check on gun purchasers, which can be done by\ncomputer. Many gun sellers at gun shows are not licensed dealers,\nso background checks and waiting periods do not apply to the people\nwho buy guns from them.\n\n   About 19 states still enforce waiting periods on the purchase of\nguns and/or permits to buy guns. Texas has no waiting period and\ndoes not require a permit to buy a gun. To carry a concealed weapon\nin Texas, you must be over 21 and qualify for a state license. But\nit's illegal to carry guns into ``a place of worship'' if such a\nplace posts a sign that handguns are prohibited.\n\n   WHERE DO THE POLITICIANS STAND?\n\n   President Bill Clinton favors strengthening the country's\ngun-control laws, including restricting gun buyers from purchasing\nmore than one handgun a month. He recently announced a federal plan\nto buy guns from their owners, estimating that the program could\nbring in 300,000 weapons. But the push to increase national\ngun-control laws since the April shootings at Columbine High School\nhas been unsuccessful.\n\n   In May, the U.S. Senate passed a gun-control bill that would\nhave required a three-day waiting period and background check for\npeople buying guns at gun shows. The House of Representatives\nproposed shrinking the waiting period from three days to 24 hours,\nbut the House bill never came to a vote. Senators and\nrepresentatives are now trying to devise a compromise bill.\n\n   WHAT HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES DONE?\n\n   In 1997, Britain made it illegal for citizens to possess any\nhandgun larger than a .22 caliber; Ireland has a similar law. In\n1996, Australia outlawed semi-automatic weapons and pump-action\nshotguns.\n\n   Canada makes gun buyers wait 28 days and submit to a background\ncheck before they can have their weapons. In Japan, only licensed\nshooting teams can own handguns. Since 1994, the United States has\nbanned 19 types of assault weapons.\n\n   (SOURCES: Handgun Control Inc., www.handguncontrol.org; The\nNational Rifle Association, www.nra.org; Center for Responsive\nPolitics, www.opensecrets.org/news/guns/index.htm; ABC News.com,\nhttp:/abcnews.go.com/sections/us/guns/guns_intro.html; National\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov)\n\n     \n   -0-   \n   Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   \n   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  \n","Headline":"\nTHE GUN CONTROL ISSUE \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM\n","Text":["\n   GUN CONTROL STATISTICS\n","\n   In 1997, firearms killed 32,436 people in the United States,\naccording to the most recent statistics from the national Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\n","\n   Every day in America, 15 children are killed with firearms,\naccording to a 1996 Children's Defense Fund report.\n","\n   In 1996, 361 children in Texas died as a result of firearms,\naccording to Handgun Control Inc., a nonpartisan organization that\nlobbies in favor of gun regulations at the state and national\nlevel.\n","\n   In 1998, Texas hosted 472 gun shows, far more than any other\nstate in the nation, according to Handgun Control.\n","\n   Firearms account for 27 percent of the 20,000 fatal injuries\neach year to children ages 1-19, according to a 1996 Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Public Health Injury Prevention Center report.\n","\n   The same study found that having a gun at home increases by\ntenfold the risk that a teen-ager may commit suicide.\n","\n   A September poll by The Washington Post and ABC News found that\n63 percent of Americans want stricter gun control laws, 77 percent\nwant to ban the sale of assault weapons, 49 percent want to ban\npeople from carrying concealed weapons, and 32 percent want a\nnationwide ban on the sale of handguns.\n","\n   WHAT'S THE ISSUE?\n","\n   The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791,\nbegins, ``A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security\nof a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\nshall not be infringed.''\n","\n   Since the 1960s, Americans have increasingly questioned how that\namendment ought to be interpreted.\n","\n   Some gun-rights advocates argue that it means exactly what it\nsays: Citizens have a right to bear arms, without interference from\nthe government.
