Times News Service   \n\n   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ When it comes to portents of gloom, doom and\ndespair, the record industry has lately been ticking off a litany\nof threats, real and imagined, posed by the Internet: Bands selling\nnew albums directly over the Net; independent artists and labels\nposting thousands of music files online; music piracy on the Web,\nand online audio sites creating vast libraries of tunes.\n\n   And yet, the major labels show no signs of ceding their reign\nover the music business. In fact, despite a few early setbacks and\nsome critical hurdles ahead, the recording industry now seems\nintent on taking a leading role in digital distribution.\n\n   That fact was underscored by the announcement last week that\nrecording, technology and consumer electronics companies had agreed\nto standards for protecting music copyrights in online music sales.\nIn the last 18 months, the major labels have waged a remarkably\nsuccessful war against piracy on the Net, using their music\nlibraries and stables of popular artists as tools to persuade\ntechnology companies to cooperate, and have positioned themselves\nto dominate the digital music era.\n\n   ``Eighteen months ago, people in the tech community told me I\nwas crazy to think we could develop an online music business'' that\nprotected copyright interests of artists and labels, said Hilary\nRosen, president and chief executive of Recording Industry\nAssociation of America, which represents the five major record\nlabels _ Sony, Universal, Warner, BMG and EMI. But today, she said,\nit was clear that ``we're moving out of the piracy era into a more\nlegitimate marketplace.''\n\n   Michael Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford C.\nBernstein & Co., said the standards announced last week by the\nSecure Digital Music Initiative, a consortium representing the\nrecording, consumer electronics and computer industries, would not\nmean a ``slam dunk'' for the labels to sell music online. Still to\nbe resolved, he noted, are pressing business model and technology\nquestions. But, he asserted, the industry had managed to dominate\nthe debate with its agenda.\n\n   ``The collective good of these five companies overruled any\nother competing interest,'' Nathanson said.\n\n   That will become more apparent to consumers this fall, when the\nmajor labels, which sell 85 percent of music in the United States,\nbegin putting their libraries online. They hope to have their\nproducts in place for the Christmas season, when portable digital\nplayers hit the market en masse, signaling the movement of online\nmusic into the mainstream and creating new demand for downloadable\ntunes.\n\n   But that has not quieted cries from the nearly $14 billion\nrecord industry that Internet piracy _ illegal copying and\ndownloading of music in cyberspace _ is costing labels and artists\ntens of millions of dollars.\n\n   The announcement last week of the consortium standards _\nguidelines for preventing portable devices from playing illegally\nobtained music _ complements the recording industry's continuing\neffort to educate the public about music piracy and to crack down\non it.\n\n   In the last two years, the industry has spent more than $1\nmillion on an information campaign, predominantly at universities,\nin an effort to persuade campuses to take steps to prevent piracy\nand to persuade students not to participate in illicit swapping of\nmusic files. Ms. Rosen said more than 200 universities had joined\nRIAA's effort to discourage students from using campus computers or\nInternet connections to make illegal copies of recordings.\n\n   The industry has also wielded a stick. Ms. Rosen said RIAA had\nforced the shutdown of some 2,000 sites offering pirated copies of\nmusic _ songs copied from commercial compact disks and uploaded to\nthe Internet _ by sending cease and desist letters to the Internet\nservice providers that hosted the sites. ``It used to be each day\nour surfers would come and there would be hundreds of sites to go\nafter,'' she said. ``The number is significantly lower.''\n\n   To others, the state of piracy remains a matter of debate.\nJoanne Marino, chief executive and editor of Webnoize, an online\nnew-media and music industry publication, said last week that\npiracy facilitated by Web sites appeared to have declined\nsignificantly. But she said it was growing in other Internet\nchannels, including songs being exchanged as e-mail attachments or\nmade available in chat rooms or on Internet file-transfer, or FTP,\nsites.\n\n   Ms. Marino said a recent Webnoize survey of 2,000 college\nstudents showed that digital downloading of music was increasing.\nShe said that from December 1998 to April, the survey found a 3,000\npercent jump in the number of students who said they had downloaded\n250 or more music files.\n\n   But a more persuasive restraint to piracy than any single effort\nby the music industry is consolidation in the online entertainment\nindustry, with larger, more established companies buying smaller\nInternet start-ups. Among recent deals, America Online acquired the\nonline radio site Spinner.com; MTV's parent, Viacom, purchased\nImagine Radio, and Yahoo announced plans to acquire Broadcast.com.\n\n   Mark Morgenstern, senior vice president for new media at the\nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP,\nwhich collects royalties for copyright holders, said that these\nbigger companies were eager to play by established copyright rules.\nAnd, he added, ``As more and more start-ups are interested in going\npublic, they are likely to take care of the rights situation.''\n\n   That transition is likely to be sealed by the consortium\nstandards.\n\n   So how did the music industry persuade technology companies and\nconsumer electronics makers to play along?\n\n   Technology companies say they realized that the online music\nmarket could become huge _ but only if the music companies agreed\nto participate and to put their libraries online. That meant\nacceding to the industry's demand that portable devices and desktop\ncomputers be prevented from playing music downloaded illegally from\nthe Internet.\n\n   The alternative was to ``change the power structure of the\nindustry,'' said Phil Barrett, senior vice president for media\ntechnologies at RealNetworks Inc., maker of Real Player. ``I'm not\nsure it's a good thing, and it's not an easy thing. Creating a\nmarketplace that's easy is paramount. Without it, you don't have an\nindustry.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Barrett, who sat in on the consortium talks, described them as\n``surprisingly cooperative.'' But not all parties walked away with\na good taste in their mouths. Some Internet music companies that\npost songs of independent labels and musicians said the major\nlabels had co-opted computer and electronics companies to brake the\nmomentum of the Net as an alternative source of music.\n\n   ``It's an attempt to maintain control of distribution,'' said\nSteve Grady, vice president for marketing for Emusic.com, a Redwood\nCity, Calif., company that sells 6,000 tracks by independent\nartists. Grady said the industry may find that the train has\nalready left the station and that it will not be simple to create\ntechnology that protects copyrights without hindering the\ntremendous flexibility the Net now provides in permitting people to\ntrade, download, store and play music.\n\n   ``The Internet consumers have already chosen the operating\nsystem for downloadable music. Right now, that's MP3,'' he said,\nreferring to a type of audio file that has frustrated the music\nindustry because it can be easily pirated.\n\n   While members of the recording industry are expressing newfound\noptimism, they also assert that the technological and business\nchallenges ahead will be steep. Larry Kenswil, president for\nelectronic commerce for Universal Music Group, the largest record\ncompany, said the company planned to be online by Christmas but\nthat a ``full-fledged launch'' might happen only next spring.\n\n   ``It takes an amazing amount of work to prepare the content,''\nhe said.\n","Headline":"\nRECORD LABELS ASSERT CONTROL IN CYBERSPACE \n","Text":["\n   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ When it comes to portents of gloom, doom and\ndespair, the record industry has lately been ticking off a litany\nof threats, real and imagined, posed by the Internet: Bands selling\nnew albums directly over the Net; independent artists and labels\nposting thousands of music files online; music piracy on the Web,\nand online audio sites creating vast libraries of tunes.\n","\n   And yet, the major labels show no signs of ceding their reign\nover the music business.
