Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans and Democrats began to file more\nthan 200 amendments Friday to a juvenile crime bill that has become\na vehicle for the kind of modest but bitterly divisive gun-control\nmeasures that the Senate approved last month.\n\n   The number and variety of these amendments, which will be\nwinnowed to a manageable few before the bill comes to the House\nfloor next week, provided a glimpse into the gaping range of House\nopinion and hinted at the difficulty that lawmakers may have in\npassing legislation on such a politically charged issue.\n\n   Republicans said Friday that the stakes of getting something\nthrough the House were high, with the very credibility of Speaker\nDennis Hastert's leadership on the line.\n\n   In many instances over the last few months, Hastert has been\nunable to forge a consensus among House Republicans, breeding\nprotracted debate, intermittent inertia and fears among House\nRepublicans that they could find themselves lurching into the 2000\nelections with the tag of a do-nothing majority.\n\n   Additionally, Hastert has his own promises to keep.

They included one Republican measure that\nwould give federal permission to post the Ten Commandments in\nclassrooms and another that would create a new category of\n``violently obscene'' entertainment and impose criminal sanctions\non adults who let children have access to the material.\n\n   On gun control, the variations in rival amendments brought the\nbattle lines between advocates and opponents into sharper focus. It\nbecame clearer, for example, that the most spirited fight would\ncome over the terms and language governing mandatory background\nchecks of buyers at gun shows.\n\n   Democrats are pushing for an amendment on shows that replicates\nthe Senate legislation, which defines those events broadly and\ngives vendors three business days to complete checks.\n\n   This week, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, unveiled an alternative that\nnarrowed the definition of the events and shortened the maximum\ntime for checks to three calendar days.\n\n   But while Democrats denounced that measure as too lenient, many\nRepublicans found it too harsh. One amendment sent to the House\nRules Committee with the blessing of Republican leaders proposed a\n24-hour limit on checks at gun shows. This position dovetailed with\nthe desires of the National Rifle Association.\n\n   In other instances, Republican leaders were less concerned that\nSenate gun-control legislation be watered down than that\nRepublicans get to vote on each measure, not a package. That way,\nRepublicans and conservative Democrats would not be forced to vote\nagainst a measure they found palatable because it was coupled with\nan unacceptable one.\n\n   One senior Republican aide said that Republican leaders wanted\nsome of these measures to pass not because the leaders felt pressed\nby public opinion but because the certain consequence of failure\nwas that Democrats would try to attach gun-control proposals to any\ntangentially relevant spending bill from now on. That disruption\ncould help shackle Republicans, stopping them from accomplishing\nother legislation.\n\n   But there were also fresh reminders Friday that Democrats were a\nlong way from unified on gun control.\n\n   Though the Clinton administration had been pushing for stricter\nmeasures than those the Senate adopted, senior Democratic aides\nsaid Friday that party leaders were aiming simply to replicate the\nother chamber's efforts.
