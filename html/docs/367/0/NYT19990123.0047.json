(Foyt) and I had a conversation during\nthe off-season, but it's not like there's any pressure on me. A.J.\nlet's you drive at your own pace. It's not like I have to prove\nanything.\n\n   ``But the bottom line in racing is you want to take the\ncheckered flag. If you're not doing that, you have a lot of room\nfor improvement.\n\n   ``And if you want to be in contention for the championship, the\nway to do that is through consistency.''\n\n   Boat could name several racetracks he'd rather begin that quest\nat than the tricky 1-mile tri-oval in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.\n\n   In keeping with the setting, some drivers have referred to the\ncourse as ``Mickey Mouse.''\n\n   Boat won't go that far, but he does admit to not yet quite\nfiguring out the quickest route from Point A to Point B.\n\n   ``It's not the easiest racetrack to race on or set your car\nup,'' Boat said. ``It's almost impossible to run side by side in\nthe corners, unlike Phoenix.\n\n   ``The trick to making your car go fast at Disney is making your\ncar turn in Turn 1, where it has a tendency to push the front end\n(toward the outer wall), but also make it comfortable in Turn 2. If\nyour car is too loose in Turn 2, you feel like you're always trying\nto save your life.\n\n   ``If your car is too good in Turn 1, that means you're probably\ngoing to be too loose in Turn 2. So you have to compromise.''\n\n   Boat isn't the only driver familiar to Walt Disney's\ndifficulties. Brack also has been victimized, finishing 13th in\nlast year's race.\n\n   Despite last season's dismal start, Brack rebounded, winning\nthree straight races at one point.\n\n   ``People may not have known too much about me last year, but I\nthink they know I can drive,'' said Brack, a native of Sweden.\n``And I know it will be hard to win another title, but I don't\nthink it will be harder.\n\n   ``This is a good team. We all get along great. I like where I'm\nat.''\n\n   Apparently, Brack means it. After last season's championship\nrun, he said he received several driving offers from non-IRL teams,\nturning thumbs down to all of them.\n\n   ``I probably had three real good offers, but I can't tell you\nwhich (series),'' Brack said. ``I'll leave that private. But they\nwere with race-winning teams.''\n\n   Team Foyt returning intact can only mean trouble to everyone\nelse.\n\n   ``Truthfully, there's a lot of good teams out there,'' Boat\nsaid. ``You can never count out (Team Menard). They lost Tony\nStewart (to NASCAR Winston Cup racing), and there may be a little\nbit of a learning curve (with new driver Greg Ray) to get back to\nwhere they were.\n\n   ``But (Ray) is a good driver, and that team has good\nequipment.''\n\n   Foyt also has provided Boat and Brack with good equipment.\n\n   Brack proved it last season.\n\n   Now, Boat says, it's his turn.  \n","Headline":"\nBOAT HAS CATCHING UP TO DO  \n SEEKS TO REDEEM SUBPAR '98 SEASON \n","Text":["\n   Nearly hoarse from repeatedly thanking A.J.
