Ken, don't\nembarrass me. Give me the odds.''\n\n   Kinkor: ``Ninety-eight percent.''\n\n   With such encouragement, Clifford went the distance and\neventually got to tell the world he believes he has found the\nflagship of Kidd _ a man with Boston roots, no less. A confirmation\ntrip is scheduled shortly. Meanwhile, Kinkor, 46, went back to his\ndesk in a small, unkempt office at the end of Macmillan Wharf here.\nNo doubt he lit a pipe, opened some books, consulted some charts,\nand pondered the next pirate mystery.\n\n   It was just one more example of how even an Iowa boy can quietly\ntangle with the ghosts of history's saltiest seagoing legends,\nemerge successful _ and, by choice, remain almost invisible.\n\n   ``Do I call myself a piratetologist? Yes, I suppose I do. I like\nthe term. It has a counterelitist ring to it, much like the people\nI study,'' Kinkor said.\n\n   ``Conventional historians are like real estate agents; they\nfocus on the prominent features _ the kitchens and living spaces of\nhistory,'' he said. ``I like like the dusty, musty crawl spaces\ntunneled by the social dissidents who never wrote the books, who\nnever made the speeches.''\n\n   He was reared in Calmar, Iowa (pop. 900), one of five children\nraised on the salary of a rural letter carrier. Mom's name is\nClementine.\n\n   ``Not long ago, I stumbled across a 25-cent book at a sidewalk\nsale that had once belonged to the DeCorah County Library,'' she\nrecalled during a telephone interview. ``It was Howard Pyle's `Book\nof Pirates.' ``On the inside cover where borrowers had signed their\nnames was the name of my son.

Kinkor knew that Sam Bellamy, the Whydah's captain, was\na thieving good friend of Palgrave Williams. Perhaps Clifford would\nwant to know something about it?\n\n   Clifford, as it turned out, had gotten a little ahead of himself\n(not the first or last time), because he would not actually find\nthe Whydah until the following year.\n\n   By then, Kinkor had already shelved the thesis, quit graduate\nschool, moved to Cape Cod, and become Clifford's right-hand man,\nconserving and scrutinizing artifacts from the wreck, and becoming\never more awed by the democracy and racial tolerance practiced\naboard pirate ships. The Clifford/Kinkor association persists to\nthis day.\n\n   Kinkor is acting director of the Whydah Museum here, where\nClifford keeps an apartment upstairs. Clifford, a divorced father\nof grown children, has turned adventure into a career and travels\nthe world exploring shipwrecks.

Quality control had eluded Kidd for the entire voyage, his\ncrew _ undisciplined from the start _ was sick, hungry, frustrated\nby the lack of spoils, and mutinous. He also had a leaking boat.\n\n   Most of his crew left him to join another pirate. So Kidd ran\nthe Adventure up on a shoal, burned it to the waterline to salvage\nwhat metal parts he could from the rigging, then bartered and\nschmoozed his way back to the American colonies where he owned a\nlarge house in New York City and, by today's standards, a condo in\nBoston.
