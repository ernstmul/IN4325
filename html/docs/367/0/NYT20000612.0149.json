A number of them make\ncomments like, ``They've got to be crazy,'' and, ``You wouldn't\ncatch !ital!me doing that.''\n\n   While the boys, in fact, may be crazy, they are the kind of\nvisitors Las Vegas embraces _ families with parents who enjoy\ngambling and kids who love to play. Last year, some 33.8 million\npeople visited the desert getaway, and 12 percent of them were\nadults who brought kids younger than 21, according to the Las Vegas\nConvention & Visitors Authority.\n\n   But is Las Vegas _ a town started by a gangster and built on\nblackjack, booze and babes _ anyplace to bring the kids? You bet it\nis.\n\n   ``We are trying to get people away from the notion that there is\nno reason to go to Las Vegas if they don't gamble,'' said Rob\nPowers, a spokesman for the visitors authority. ``Now it's, like,\n`I've never been a big gambler, but I've got to check out Las Vegas\nbecause there's so much going on there now.'''\n\n   What they find when they get there are billion-dollar\nhotel/casinos with sinking pirate ships, interactive simulator\nrides, miniature golf courses, arcades and roller coasters.\n\n   To be sure, gambling is what it's mostly about in Las Vegas.\nStill, casino owners aren't going to turn their backs on the\nmillions of visitors who aren't yet old enough to place bets or\npull slot-machine handles.\n\n   The first to mine the family market in a big way was Circus\nCircus, which opened in 1968. At that time it was just a Midway\narea, where circus performers continue to do their stuff daily. The\nhotel, which now boasts 3,770 rooms, came later.\n\n   ``Families traveling with kids have always been our niche\nmarket,'' said Circus Circus spokesman Reggie Burton. ``That's what\nseparates us from the other Strip properties.''\n\n   To further carve out its niche, Circus Circus added a 399-space\nRV park (the only one on the Strip). And, in 1993, came\nAdventuredome. The five-acre indoor theme park was launched with\nfour rides, and now features 18 attractions.\n\n   Since its opening, more than 10 million guests (an average of\n8,000 a day) have checked out the roller coaster, miniature golf\ncourse, IMAX ride simulator, laser tag, animatronic dinosaurs and\nother features. Even readers of the local newspaper, the Las Vegas\nReview-Journal, were impressed, naming it Best Family Attraction in\nthe most recent annual poll.\n\n   The Adventuredome opening came at a time when the city was\nmaking a big play for families. By the end of 1993, three new\nmega-resorts had opened, each luring families in their own ways _\nLuxor had its interactive simulator rides and virtual reality\ngames, Treasure Island had its pirate ship battles out front, and\nMGM Grand had its own theme park. Soon after, stories about\nkid-friendly Las Vegas appeared in the national media.\n\n   ``A lot of people interpreted the new resorts to mean that Las\nVegas was moving in a new direction. But that wasn't the case,''\nPowers said. ``What was happening was Las Vegas was diversifying as\na resort.''\n\n   That was the thinking at MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, which\ncreated what feels like a miniature version of Knott's Berry Farm _\ncomplete with a log ride, roller coaster and bumper boats _ as a\npart of the $1 billion, 5,005-room destination at the south end of\nthe Strip.\n\n   ``We talked about building something that could facilitate\nfamilies and offer something unique to the city,'' said Debi\nFetzner, vice president of theme park administration and operations\nfor the property. ``We were never concerned about taking away from\nthe gaming revenue because the park caters to the under-21 crowd.\nIt's just an enhancement for our guests.''\n\n   So is the MGM Grand's year-old Lion Habitat, where more than\n10,000 people daily have walked inside a see-through tunnel that\nallows them to get close-up views of some big cats.\n\n   While there are only so many theme parks in Las Vegas, everyone,\nit seems, has a roller coaster. Some of the rides may be too\nintense for the littlest ones, but all are intended to attract\nyounger crowds. The Stratosphere added high-altitude thrills to its\nride by placing it at the top of its tower, New York-New York Hotel\n& Casino has the Manhattan Express, and the Sahara Hotel and Casino\nin April launched Speed _ The Ride, which zooms guests along a\n1,365-foot track at up to 70 mph.\n\n   ``The additions bring a lot of attention to Las Vegas as a\nfamily destination,'' Burton said. ``There is more to do now than\nthere was seven, eight years ago for families traveling with young\nchildren.''\n\n   Still, some casinos are more kid-friendly than others. At the\nelegant $1.9 billion Bellagio, children as young as 4 are charged\nthe same as adults at the buffet _ $23 for dinner and $18.50 for\nthe weekend brunch. At least kids 3 and younger get in free.\n\n   The family food budget goes a little farther up the Strip at the\nTreasure Island Buffet, where adults pay $11.50 for the weekend\nchampagne brunch. Kids ages 4-11 can enjoy the same food, with\ntheir bubbly being a glass of sparkling apple cider, for less than\n$6.\n\n   There's an even better deal at New York-New York. At the hotel\nand casino's America Restaurant, kids can choose from eight\nentrees, including grilled-cheese sandwiches and chicken fingers,\nfor only $5 (drinks and ice cream desert included). And while they\ndine, they can find their hometowns on a giant map of the United\nStates that dominates the room.\n\n   But there's no time for the kids to get homesick in Las Vegas,\nespecially if the family's agenda includes a stop at MGM Grand's\nYouth Activity Center or Camp Hyatt at the Hyatt Regency Lake Las\nVegas Resort, which is about 10 miles out of town. Both places have\nadult-supervised fun for kids ages 3-12, giving Mom and Dad the\nchance to get away and do their own thing.\n\n   The MGM Grand's center offers an arts and crafts room, table\ntennis, mini pool tables, basketball and hockey group activities,\nboard games and Super Nintendo. Meals and an outing to the theme\npark are also available.\n\n   Camp Hyatt, open only to guests staying at the resort, offers\nmany of the same activities, plus mud- and sandcastle building,\nkaraoke and swimming.\n\n   As legalized gambling becomes more common around the country,\nand big-money lottery payouts draw headlines, it only makes sense\nLas Vegas would look at other avenues for drawing crowds.\n\n   ``The focus in the last few years has been away from gambling in\nterms of marketing and amenities,'' Powers said. ``Las Vegas is\nstill known as a gambling destination, and the casino industry is\nstill the foundation of the resort industry here.\n\n   ``But when you add everything together, you have a picture of\nLas Vegas as truly a well-rounded resort destination, and not just\na collection of casinos in the middle of the desert.''\n","Headline":"\nLAS VEGAS CASINOS GET KID-FRIENDLY\n","Text":["\n     \nIF YOU GO   \nGETTING THERE: From the Los Angeles area, take Interstate 10 east\nto I-15 north.
