Times News Service   \n\n   The oral polio vaccine, used routinely in the United States\nsince the 1960s, should be replaced by old-fashioned polio shots,\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement issued on\nMonday.\n\n   The recommendation is the final step in phasing out the oral\nvaccine, which began in 1997 when health officials recommended that\nthe first two doses of polio vaccine be given by injection and the\nlast two by mouth, instead of all four being given by mouth.\n\n   The reason for the change is that the oral vaccine, which\ncontains a live but weakened form of the polio virus, can in rare\ninstances cause polio, either in the child receiving the vaccine or\nin an unvaccinated adult who comes into contact with the child.\nAbout eight such cases occur each year in the United States, one\nfor every 2.4 million oral doses given.\n\n   The injected vaccine, which is just as effective as the oral\none, cannot cause polio, because it uses an inactivated form of the\nvirus. The injected vaccine used today is an updated, stronger\nversion of the original vaccine that was developed by Dr. Jonas\nSalk and introduced to the public in 1953. The Salk vaccine\ninjections were later replaced by Dr. Albert Sabin's oral vaccine\nbecause the oral version was more effective and better able to stop\noutbreaks in areas where many cases occurred.\n\n   The academy's new recommendation is nearly identical to one made\nin June by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nwhich said that after Jan. 1, 2000, all four doses of the vaccine\nshould be injected, rather than given by mouth. The doses are to be\ngiven when children are 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months and 4 to\n6 years old.\n\n   But the academy's recommendation differed from that of the\nfederal centers in one respect: instead of recommending, as the\ncenters did, that doctors stop using the oral vaccine altogether in\nJanuary, the academy said that during the first few months of 2000\ndoctors could use up their leftover oral vaccine by giving it as\nthe third or fourth dose to children who had already had two or\nthree injections of polio vaccine.\n\n   An advocacy group representing families whose children had\ncontracted polio from the oral vaccine strongly objected to the\nidea of allowing doctors to continue to use it, suggesting that it\nmight cause more cases of polio. John Salamone, president of\nInformed Parents Against VAPP (vaccine-associated paralytic polio),\nissued a statement saying that members were ``deeply troubled'' by\ncontinued use of the vaccine, especially since doctors could return\nit the manufacturer.\n\n   A spokeswoman for the manufacturer, Wyeth Lederle Vaccines, a\ndivision of American Home Products, confirmed that the company\nwould take the oral vaccine back and give doctors refunds or\ncredits.\n\n   But Dr. Georges Peter, a professor of pediatrics at Brown\nUniversity and chairman of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee,\nwho helped develop the academy's recommendations, said that no\ncases of polio had ever been linked to the oral vaccine when it was\nused as a third or fourth dose in children who had already had two\nor three injected doses.\n\n   ``I don't mean in any way to belittle the parents' concerns, but\nI think the risk from the academy's policy is minimal to\nnonexistent,'' Peter said.\n","Headline":"\nDOCTORS URGE POLIO SHOTS TO REPLACE ORAL VACCINE \n","Text":["\n   The oral polio vaccine, used routinely in the United States\nsince the 1960s, should be replaced by old-fashioned polio shots,\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement issued on\nMonday.\n","\n   The recommendation is the final step in phasing out the oral\nvaccine, which began in 1997 when health officials recommended that\nthe first two doses of polio vaccine be given by injection and the\nlast two by mouth, instead of all four being given by mouth.\n","\n   The reason for the change is that the oral vaccine, which\ncontains a live but weakened form of the polio virus, can in rare\ninstances cause polio, either in the child receiving the vaccine or\nin an unvaccinated adult who comes into contact with the child.\nAbout eight such cases occur each year in the United States, one\nfor every 2.4 million oral doses given.\n","\n   The injected vaccine, which is just as effective as the oral\none, cannot cause polio, because it uses an inactivated form of the\nvirus.
