Times News Service   \n\n   HONG KONG _ The stars were on glittering display in Hong Kong\nWednesday, though not on the silver screen.\n\n   Movie theaters across the territory went dark for the day to\nprotest the flood of illegally copied films. An array of local film\nand pop celebrities led a rally of 2,000 people to demand a tougher\ncrackdown on piracy.\n\n   Film producers say the Hong Kong film industry, once one of the\nlargest exporters of movies after Hollywood, has been devastated by\nthe explosive growth of movies illegally recorded onto compact\ndisks.\n\n   ``It's a downward spiral,'' said Woody Tsung, the chief\nexecutive of the Motion Picture Industry Association. ``The only\nway we can come out of this crisis is if the government gets rid of\npiracy.''\n\n   For all the doomsday talk, the protest Wednesday was a bubbly\naffair.
