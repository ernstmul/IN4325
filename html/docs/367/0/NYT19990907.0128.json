He plays a stereotype driving a stolen ice-cream\ntruck that will keep a canister of toxic chemicals cool while Skeet\nUlrich's watered-down James Dean loner chills his way through the\ndumb chase stuff. (R) \n \n!! ``Floating'' Concord, Mass. native William Roth brings rich\natmosphere and a waste-free narrative style to the bittersweet\nstory of a teenager's summer of awakening, and Norman Reedus plays\nthe townie teen with natural grace. But some of the supporting\ncharacters are cartoonish, and one edges into old-fashioned\ntortured-homosexual stereotype. (Unrated) (Matthew Gilbert) \n \n! ``Outside Providence'' The Farrelly brothers (``There's Something\nAbout Mary'') collaborate with Michael Corrente (``Federal Hill,''\n``American Buffalo'') on a coming-of-age story that, while\nfamiliar, steers clear of cliche. There's no ``American Pie''\nglorying in dumbness here, just a tender, gritty honesty. Shawn\nHatosy brings unforced conviction to the role of a blue-collar\nRhode Island kid packed off to boarding school by his dad, played\nwith terrific control by Alec Baldwin.
