People made their own. Shakers and other\nresidents in earlier America painted their interiors and\nfurnishings with a milk paint whose formula dates back to Ancient\nEgypt.\n\n   Their paint mix was to simply combine milk protein, quicklime\nand earth pigments.\n\n   Milk paint is being made again today, because of its lasting\ndurable color. There are examples of milk paint finishes a few\nhundred years old that still reflect the true color of the day they\nwere applied.\n\n   The Old-Fashioned Milk Paint Company in Groton, Mass., has been\nmaking such paint in 16 muted colors, from barn red to Lexington\ngreen, mustard and pumpkin, the old-fashioned way since 1974, when\nowner Charles E. Thibeau couldn't find it in hardware or paint\nstores. He re-created the old milk paint formula to provide an\nauthentic finish for his hand-made reproduction furniture.\n\n   Ingredients include milk protein, clay, lime and earth pigments,\nsuch as ochre, umber, iron oxide and lampblack. No chemical\npreservatives, fungicides or lead is used. Milk paint is packaged\nin a dry powder form, allowing you to control the thickness for\neither a wash stain, full cover coat or for stenciling. Powders\nalso may be mixed to create other hues and tones. Various finishes\nand textures _ from a semigloss to an antique crackle _ can also be\nachieved.\n\n   There is a slight milky odor when applied and it's odorless when\ndry in two hours, making it safe for those who are allergic to\nmodern paints and for children's toys and furniture.\n\n   It doesn't contain hydrocarbons or any petroleum derivatives.\nMilk paint is easily cleaned up with soap and water.\n\n   Powdered milk paint comes in three sizes from a pint ($8.50) to\na quart ($14.95) and gallon ($42.95), which when added to water\nwill cover approximately 35, 75 and 300 square feet respectively.\n\n   A milk paint surface can be polished, oiled, waxed, distressed\nand polyurethaned. Mixed with Milk Paint's Extra-Bond, it also will\nadhere to most nonporous surfaces, and a coat of Clear-Coat, will\nseal the painted surface, making it easy to clean fingerprints and\nspills.\n\n   You also can make a version of milk paint for yourself by\ncombining powdered milk, pigment, lime and water.\n","Headline":"\nMILK PAINTS, STAPLE OF YESTERYEAR, LAST FOREVER \n","Text":["\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ House paint was not sold commercially until the\nmiddle of the 1880s.
