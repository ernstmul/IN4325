Times News Service   \n\n   Even those unmoved by Leonard Bernstein's exuberant musicianship\nfind it impossible to deny his magnetism. As conductor and pianist,\nBernstein energized audiences. His exciting podium presence was the\nstuff of legend, and caricature. Yet his enthusiasm for music was\nreal _ innate, even _ and not merely generated for public\nconsumption.\n\n   With Bernstein's death in 1990, audiences lost a maestro who\ncould be many things but never boring. A decade on, no one has come\nclose to replacing him, either on the podium or in the public\nimagination. So it is easy to understand why Sony Classical has\nopted to ring out the old millennium with a gargantuan series of\nmidprice CD reissues titled Bernstein Century.\n\n   The appellation is too grand on several counts. Although Sony's\nvaults (formerly Columbia's, then CBS's) contain a trove of\nBernstein's best recordings, most of his early ones were made for\nRCA and his later ones for Deutsche Grammophon. Still, his Columbia\ndiscs represent a signal achievement. Here is America's first\nnative-born conducting superstar at the very summit of his powers,\ndriven but not yet mannered, ebullient but not yet self-indulgent.\n\n   Bernstein recorded around 500 works for Columbia from 1950\nthrough the '70s. His only competition in terms of output and\nbreadth of repertory came from Herbert von Karajan, an Austrian,\nand Neville Marriner, an Englishman.\n\n   Just as Karajan was tied to the Berlin Philharmonic and Marriner\nto the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Bernstein was\ninextricably linked during this period with the New York\nPhilharmonic. The orchestra's music director from 1958 through\n1969, he made the vast majority of his Columbia albums with the\nPhilharmonic, which had a relationship with the label dating from\n1917.\n\n   Sony says that all of Bernstein's Columbia recordings, including\na few items not previously issued, will be released in this series.\nTo date, 80 Bernstein Century CD's are available: roughly half of\nthe conductor's Columbia output, according to the label.\n\n   Not that Bernstein has ever been neglected by Sony. His\nrecordings appear in various lines, including the large Royal\nEdition, with watercolors by the Prince of Wales pointlessly\ndecorating the albums. Many of the fine 20-bit transfers from that\nseries have been recycled for this one, which variously employs 20-\nand 24-bit technology.\n\n   Since much of the Royal Edition remains available, consumers\nwith an interest in Bernstein face some confusion. Not every title\nin Bernstein Century was part of the earlier series, and many items\nin the Royal Edition are not yet available in the new format.\nBuyers should therefore double- check their collections before\npurchasing these CD's.\n\n   Naturally, Bernstein Century gives pride of place to the twin\npillars of the conductor's collaboration with Columbia, Mahler and\nAmerican music. Bernstein brought to Mahler lasting public\nrecognition and to American music the wider audiences sought by his\nmentor Serge Koussevitzky. But many of the happiest discoveries in\nthis collection lie somewhat off the beaten path.\n\n   Although Brahms was hardly unknown territory for Bernstein, the\ncomposer's scores never occupied the Olympian ground he reserved\nfor Beethoven, there favoring speed and lean textures but also\nmajesty. In Brahms, Bernstein confounds expectations, upending the\nwarm approach maestros like Bruno Walter made standard. Bernstein's\nrecordings from the early to mid-'60s lack that lambency,\nsubstituting pure power instead. If precision is sacrificed in the\nprocess, passion certainly is not: Bernstein's account of the\n``Academic Festival Overture'' (SMK 61846), for instance, charges\nahead on more than just celebratory vim. Yet he was never\ninterested in brute force alone, as the Andante from the Third\nSymphony (SMK 61829), filled with aching romance, proves.\n\n   A similar melding of muscularity and ardency characterizes\nBernstein's approach to Baroque music, not an area normally\nassociated with him. In unorthodox, big-boned approaches to Bach's\n``St. Matthew Passion'' and Handel's ``Messiah,'' Bernstein's\nabundant verve and idiosyncratic spirituality go far toward\nmitigating the violence he inflicts on the scores.\n\n   The ``Messiah'' (SM2K 60205; two CDs), though grandly conceived\nand bursting with ardor, is mercilessly rearranged by Bernstein.\nYet his inclusion of the countertenor Russell Oberlin among the\nsoloists is inspired and forward-looking. The ``St. Matthew\nPassion'' (SM2K 60727; two CDs), rendered in English and severely\ncut, proves more problematic. Still, the sextet of committed\nsoloists, including the soprano Adele Addison (also featured in\n``Messiah'') and the mezzo-soprano Betty Allen, is worth hearing. A\n16-minute lecture by Bernstein, somewhat perversely tucked in as\nfiller, offers an intelligent introduction, delivered in the\nconductor's inimitably accessible style.\n\n   Bernstein's astonishing ability to convey the meaning of music\nthrough speech was among his main strengths. In a series of public\ntalks, often televised or filmed, he eloquently and plainly\nelucidated for countless Americans, especially the young, the power\nof music to enrich. Bernstein Century reveals this talent on a disc\ncoupling Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony with ``How a Great\nSymphony Was Written,'' a 15-minute lecture recorded in 1965 (SMK\n60692). In his characteristic nasal, gravelly voice, the conductor\nexplains Beethoven's genius and the creation of a masterwork in\nterms that challenge without alienating the untrained ear.\n\n   Getting audiences to feel as he did about music was perhaps at\nthe core of Bernstein's being, and one senses that generous and\nenthusiastic spirit particularly in performances of the bighearted\n19th- and 20th-century orchestral works that were central to his\nrepertory. A 1959 recording of Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Scheherazade''\n(SMK 60737), for example, though less supple and refined than\ncelebrated versions by Thomas Beecham and Fritz Reiner, brims with\ntension and color.\n\n   Similarly, a 1960 recording of Tchaikovsky's ``Capriccio\nItalien'' (SMK 61556), included as a fillip on a CD dominated by an\nindifferent account of the composer's Fourth Symphony, shows\nBernstein at his grandiose best in a piece that benefits from the\ntheatrics. Though his expansive account of Sibelius' Second\nSymphony (SMK 61848) will not be to all tastes, some listeners may\ndelight in its sanguine embrace.\n\n   Listeners of all stripes will be drawn to the recordings of\nMahler and American music that Bernstein Century has so\nattractively repackaged. In these scores, the conductor's\ninterpretive powers reached their summit, and although much has\nbeen written about his extraordinary sympathy for this repertory,\nthe greatest tribute to his powers as a world-class Mahlerian and\nAmerican-music advocate may lie less in praising these outstanding\nrecordings than in noting what followed in their wake.\n\n   Mahler was hardly unknown when Bernstein began championing his\nmusic on record in 1960. (Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Dimitri\nMitropoulos and Hermann Scherchen, among others, had recorded\nindividual symphonies well before then.) But Bernstein was the\nfirst to record all of Mahler's symphonies and a good deal of his\nvocal music as well. Since then, most major conductors have\ncommitted Mahler cycles to disc. If anything, we have a surfeit of\nMahler records today.\n\n   The situation may be less clear with regard to American music,\nwhich many insist still suffers from neglect. But if Koussevitzky\ncleared the path, in concert and on record, then Bernstein paved\nthe road. Certainly, the conductors Michael Tilson Thomas, Leonard\nSlatkin and Gerard Schwarz, the best-known current advocates of\nAmerican music, benefited from Bernstein's resoluteness.\n\n   At present, Bernstein Century offers a dozen solidly packed CDs\nof American music, not counting the eight featuring Bernstein's own\nscores. For some, Bernstein's accounts of Copland, Ives, Gershwin,\nBarber and William Schuman are not so much benchmark recordings as\nholy writ, for the conductor enjoyed deep associations with these\ncomposers.\n\n   nn\n\n   Those less familiar with this music should relish two potpourri\ndiscs. In ``American Masters'' (SMK 60594), Bernstein leads three\nsymphonies feelingly: Roy Harris' searing Third, David Diamond's\nglinting Fourth and Randall Thompson's propulsive Third. In\n``American Masters,'' Volume 2 (SMK 61849), he indulges in the\nraucous pleasures of Walter Piston's ``Incredible Flutist'' and,\nwith Orson Welles as narrator, he blunts the political cant of Marc\nBlitzstein's ``Airborne Symphony.''\n\n   Naturally, no discussion of Bernstein is complete without\nmentioning his own compositions, works that place the conductor in\na singular category. Like his hero Mahler, Bernstein excelled at\nboth conducting and composing, but Mahler, who died in 1911, left\nno real recorded legacy. Yes, other esteemed conductors also\ncomposed, but how many music lovers today clamor for the symphonies\nof Wilhelm Furtwaengler or Jean Martinon?\n\n   For all the prejudicial comments leveled at Bernstein's concert\nworks _ derivative, slight, turgid _ no one disputes the\nseriousness with which he approached their composition. That he\nleft recordings of his own works only enhances our appreciation of\nthem, for who better than this gifted maestro to interpret the work\nof a major American composer, especially if the composer is\nhimself?\n\n   Unlike the conductors who were famous in life but left only\nfaint footprints, Bernstein seems assured of his place in the\ncollective memory. With this series, Sony has finally done an\nindisputably great artist proud. Like the man himself, Bernstein\nCentury is grandly ambitious, abundantly intelligent and often\nintensely moving.\n","Headline":"\nREMEASURING BERNSTEIN, A MAESTRO FOR THE AGES \n","Text":["\n   Even those unmoved by Leonard Bernstein's exuberant musicianship\nfind it impossible to deny his magnetism.
