What's new is the unprecendented ease brought by the\nInternet for pirating and distributing software, leading to a crop\nof new applications such as Napster for copying and sharing music,\nand DivX, which can be used to duplicate movies.\n\n   The gaming industry estimates that over $3 billion is lost every\nyear from piracy, a huge sum considering the industry itself pulled\nin just $6.9 billion in 1999 from sales of both consoles and\nsoftware.\n\n   ``Console makers earn a majority of their cash from licensing\nsoftware,'' said Michael Goodman, a senior analyst with the Yankee\nGroup. ``So piracy is literally a direct attack on their revenue\nstream.''\n\n   Sega, which is based in Japan and has operations in San\nFrancisco, is teaming up with other console makers and software\npublishers to fight back. Their arsenal was considerably beefed up\nwhen Congress this year passed the Digital Millennium Copyright\nAct, which allowed copyright holders to go after Web sites and\nInternet service providers that host sales of pirated software.\n\n   In this latest broadside, Sega last week began issuing cease and\ndesist orders to five auction sites, including those hosted by\nYahoo!, eBay, Lycos, Excite and Amazon.com, according to Charles\nBellfield, Sega's spokesman. In addition, the company asked\nInternet service providers to shut down Web sites that sell pirated\ngames, as well as companies hosting virtual hard drives that are\nused by their customers for storing pirated games.\n\n   ``Those companies that do not comply will face both civil and\ncriminal prosecution by both federal and state authorities with\nwhom we are working with,'' said Bellfield.\n\n   Thus far, all the companies Sega has approached have cooperated,\naccording to Bellfield. Sega continues to issue cease and desist\norders daily, he said. The company, which said it loses millions of\ndollars a year to piracy, is working with European officials and\nnegotiating with Asian law enforcement on its crusade.\n\n   Last March, Sega teamed up with game-maker Nintendo and\nElectronic Arts, a large game publisher, to file a lawsuit against\nYahoo! to prevent pirated games from being sold on Yahoo's Web\nsite. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in California, is\nstill pending.\n\n   But game industry analysts question how successful companies\nwill be in stamping out illicit copying of digital products via\nNapster, DivX or a simple $200 compact disk ``burner'' that can\nduplicate CDs.\n\n   ``This is part of a bigger picture of piracy,'' said P.J.\nMcNealy, analyst with the Gartner Group. ``As more things become\ndigital, they will become more portable and easier to exchange,\nparticularly over the Internet.
