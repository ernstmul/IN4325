BROAD    \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ He lived on Wall Street, a Turkish carpet on his\nparlor floor, casks of Madeira in his cellar. His tall house had\nscrolled dormers and fluted chimneys, which ships seeking New York\nmoorage sought out as landmarks. A family man with two daughters,\nhe owned a pew at Trinity Church.\n\n   But the privateer William Kidd wanted more. Most especially, he\nwanted a life free of 17th-century strictures.\n\n   He fortified his ship, named Adventure, with 34 big guns and\nmore than a hundred men, and between 1696 and 1698 became a terror\nof the seas, amassing a fortune in gold, silk and jewels.\n\n   Adventure was uncommon in that it was a true galley, boasting\nnot only sails but oars. When the wind failed, Kidd could push\nahead relentlessly, taking over a becalmed merchant ship with ease.\n\n   Three centuries after the infamous pirate was forced to abandon\nhis flagship, leaving it scuttled and partly burned, a team of\nmarine explorers probing waters off Madagascar has found what\nappears to be the Adventure's remains. Tantalizing clues include a\nlarge pile of ballast stones, burned wood, rum bottles and Ming\nporcelain shards dating from the Kidd era. Most notable of all, the\nteam found a large metal oarlock a foot long.\n\n   The discovery of Kidd's galley, if verified by further study of\nthe sunken wreckage, would reveal much about one of history's most\ncolorful and ill-fated pirates, who was tried and executed in\nLondon in 1701, his body displayed as a warning to kindred souls.\n\n   Scholars say the ship's wreckage is unlikely to yield treasure.\nBut if it is one of the few pirate artifacts to come into modern\nhands, the hulk will illuminate a lost age.\n\n   ``The problem with pirates is there's so little they left\nbehind,'' said Robert C. Ritchie, a historian and author of\n``Captain Kidd and the War against the Pirates'' (Harvard, 1986).\n``So to find the Adventure galley would be lovely. It's one of the\nmost famous pirate ships in history.''\n\n   Indisputably, experts say, the remains of the Adventure lie\nsomewhere in the harbor of Ste. Marie, a tiny isle off Madagascar.\n\n   Pirates in the age of discovery hid there and would venture out\nfrom its palm thickets to raid shipping in and around the Indian\nOcean.\n\n   The question is whether the Adventure is now found, or whether\nthe uncovered hulk is the remains of some other lost ship.\n\n   The leader of the Kidd expedition, Barry L. Clifford of\nProvincetown, Mass., is well known among historians and\narchaeologists for having located in 1985 the Whydah, a fabled\npirate ship that sank in 1717 off Cape Cod in a fierce storm.\n\n   To date, the Whydah is the only pirate ship whose identity has\nbeen verified, although in 1997 archaeologists found what they\nbelieve may be the remains of Blackbeard's flagship, Queen Anne's\nRevenge, off North Carolina. But the Blackbeard evidence is so far\ncircumstantial.\n\n   In an interview, Clifford, a veteran diver just back from the\nMadagascar site, said he set his sights on Adventure about three\nyears ago. The hunt led him to historical documents in British and\nAmerican archives, satellite images of the tropic harbor and\nunderwater gear that detects metal and uses high-frequency sound to\nprobe mud and silt.\n\n   This month, his team of a dozen experts explored the watery\ngrave for two weeks.\n\n   ``We almost dropped the anchor on top of the wreck,'' Clifford\nsaid of his lucky start. ``It's a preliminary investigation. But\nwe're sure we've located it. Everything lines up perfectly,\nespecially the fact that we found this very large oarlock on the\nmain ballast pile.''\n\n   Further study of the wreckage will reveal more of how Kidd and\nhis men lived and died, Clifford said, probably producing artifacts\nlike china, glassware, guns, coins, tools and a better\nunderstanding of how Adventure was built and lost.\n\n   ``We need to do a lot more investigation,'' Clifford said,\nadding that readings from an underwater detector showed that the\nwreckage was dense with metal. ``You never know,'' he remarked,\n``they might have had silver ingots in the bilge.'' In those days,\nthe precious metal was sometimes used as heavy ballast to help keep\na ship steady.\n\n   William Kidd was born in Scotland in 1645, apparently to a\nfamily of modest means, and went to sea as a young man. In the West\nIndies and off North America, he sailed as a privateer for Britain,\nsuccessfully fighting the French. In his late 40s, an established\nsea captain and ship owner, he married a rich widow in New York\nCity in 1691 and came to own what is now some of the world's most\ncostly real estate.\n\n   Alexander Winston, author of ``No Man Knows My Grave'' (Houghton\nMifflin, 1969), a study of pirates and privateers, lists Kidd's\nproperties as corresponding to 56 Wall St., 86-90 and 119-21 Pearl\nSt., 52-56 Water St. and 25, 27 and 29 Pine St.\n\n   In spite of (or perhaps because of) his growing domestic\nresponsibilities, Kidd sailed for London. In 1695 he received a\nroyal commission and investors, including some of King William's\nministers, to go fight pirates attacking ships of the British East\nIndia Co. in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.\n\n   When he got there, however, he avoided doing battle with the\nbrigands and instead became one himself.\n\n   He still had a conscience, of sorts. His refusal to attack a\nDutch ship roused his crew to near mutiny, and Kidd in an angry\nexchange hit his gunner so hard the blow proved fatal.\n\n   After capturing up to a half dozen ships, including ones of\nIndian and Portuguese origin, he sailed his increasingly leaky\nflagship into Ste. Marie's harbor, the sea lapping at the decks.\n\n   The crew emptied much of the sinking ship, which was then\nburned, apparently by Kidd to save some metal parts for trade and\nsale. He then sailed a captured merchant ship for home.\n\n   In New York, Boston and London, Kidd explained his thievery as\nforced by rowdy crews lusting for gold. But the British government\ndismissed evidence of rebellion and had Kidd hanged _ twice, it\nturned out. The rope broke the first time.\n\n   Kenneth J. Kinkor, a historian who works with Clifford, said\nKidd was a fall guy. ``It wouldn't have made nearly such a stir''\nbut for Kidd's government investors. ``They needed a scapegoat to\npacify the Mogul empire in India, and the East India Co.''\n\n   The authorities recovered some of Kidd's treasure. But stories\npersist about missing hoards, the loot allegedly buried in places\nlike Hispaniola, Long Island at Hempstead Harbor and off the\nConnecticut coast on the Charles and Thimble Islands. So far, all\nfortune seekers have apparently come up empty-handed.\n\n   Today, scholars know of no authenticated personal property of\nKidd or his men, only accounts of his life and adventures, which\nare often contradictory or frustratingly vague.\n\n   Clifford's bid to find the pirate's flagship was largely\nfinanced by the Discovery Channel, which plans a half-hour news\nspecial on the hunt on Feb. 25 at 9 p.m. and a documentary later\nthis year or next. The venture's scholarly side was aided by John\nde Bry, a doctoral candidate at the Sorbonne, who specializes in\nhistorical archaeology.\n\n   In interviews, the ship hunters said the main clue to the\nAdventure's grave came from testimony at a pirate trial in which a\ncrewman said the ship had been abandoned in the harbor near a\ncareening area. In the age of tall ships, careening was a necessary\njob in which ships were rolled on their sides so crewmen could\nscrape off barnacles and repair hull damage. Such work was\nespecially vital for pirates hoping to strike fast.\n\n   The sandy beach of a tropic isle was the perfect place for a\nship to be pulled ashore and tipped for such maintenance.\n\n   Luckily for Clifford and his team, the harbor at Ste. Marie\nturned out to have but one beach free of rocks, marking it like an\n``X'' on a treasure map. The careening spot was on a small harbor\nisland, named Madame, where drunken pirates are said to have\ncavorted with women.\n\n   During the team's hunt, the water was murky and the seabed thick\nwith sea urchins, lion fish and stone fish, whose rocklike\ncamouflage and poisonous spines make them a bane of divers.\n\n   On Jan. 31, the team's second day exploring the site, Clifford\nwas diving over the muddy bottom off the careening beach when he\nstarted to see what looked like ballast stones.\n\n   ``I had assumed the whole thing could be buried,'' he recalled.\n``Then, looming in front of me was a big, big pile of rocks. It\nlooked like a pin cushion, covered with huge sea urchins, their\nspines a foot long. It was scary. Stone fish were everywhere.''\n\n   Hovering over the wreck, careful to touch nothing, Clifford saw\namong the ballast stones little bits of blue, which turned out to\nbe Ming dynasty porcelain. ``It was everywhere,'' he said. ``I\nsucked my tank dry'' before being forced to the surface.\n\n   The array of large wreckage was in water some 22 feet deep and\nsome 125 feet off the careening beach. Further study disclosed two\nother, smaller ballast piles nearby. ``These wrecks were completely\nvirgin,'' Clifford said. ``Not a stone was overturned.''\n\n   For two weeks, Clifford looked hard for a ship's bell. It was\nhis discovery in 1985 of the Whydah's, inscribed ``The Whydah Gally\n1716,'' that definitively marked that wreck as a lost pirate ship.\n\n   But so far, he has found no bell off Madagascar. One day,\nhowever, Clifford did spy a promising lump in the murk and was\nfanning off the silt until, he recalled, he stopped suddenly ``an\ninch short'' of hitting what turned out to be a deadly stone fish.\n\n   All told, the team found a total of four of five different\nwrecks, most probably pirate and identified by name in old\ndocuments.\n\n   In a telephone interview from Paris, where he went after the\nexpedition, de Bry said he had discovered in the French national\nlibrary a new map, dated 1755, that showed not only the careening\narea but the location of two lost vessels, which the legend\nidentified as sunken pirate ships.\n\n   ``That's exactly where Barry found the wrecks,'' he said. ``You\ncan't get better than that.''\n\n   Clifford has told Madagascar's minister of culture of the find\nand is seeking permission to perform a test excavation of the\nwatery site. He hopes to return in the next few months and\nultimately learn enough about the Adventure to publish scholarly\npapers and build a model of the ship in Boston as part of a pirate\nmuseum.\n\n   ``He lived on Wall Street and was the ultimate corporate\nraider,'' Clifford said. ``But who was he, really?''\n\n   The newly found wreckage, he said, may finally give the world\n``a chance to find out'' a lot more about the failed adventurer,\nKidd, once a scourge of the high seas.\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nSEEKING PIRATE TREASURE: CAPTAIN KIDD'S SUNKEN SHIP \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ He lived on Wall Street, a Turkish carpet on his\nparlor floor, casks of Madeira in his cellar.
