By BILL CARTER   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   NBC removed references to the transportation of nuclear waste\nfrom a television movie it will broadcast this Sunday night, citing\ninaccuracies in the depiction of how nuclear waste is handled.\n\n   But Sen. Richard H. Bryan of Nevada accused the network\nWednesday of caving in to pressure from lobbyists for nuclear power\ncompanies. Bryan, a Democrat, said he had only circumstantial\nevidence that NBC had been so influenced, but he pointed to the\nfact that NBC's parent company, General Electric, has significant\ninterests in the nuclear power industry.\n\n   NBC executives said General Electric had no input in their\ndecision.\n\n   The film, ``Atomic Train,'' centers on a train traveling from\nIdaho to Colorado, which loses its brakes and threatens the city of\nDenver because of a nuclear bomb that has been secretly put on\nboard.\n\n   That much of the plot is unaffected. But the film also\nrepeatedly made reference to a cargo of nuclear waste products. NBC\nordered all mentions of nuclear waste in the film dialogue\noverdubbed so that the words are now ``hazardous waste.''\n\n   NBC immediately removed all the promotions for the film, which\nhad carried the inference that the events in the film were based in\nreality. NBC had also sent out news releases, which cited\nsupposedly real instances of nuclear waste being transported on\ntrains in Western states.\n\n   The network insisted that a disclaimer be added to the beginning\nof the film and at every long commercial break telling viewers that\nwhat they are seeing is a work of fiction.\n\n   Rosalyn P.
