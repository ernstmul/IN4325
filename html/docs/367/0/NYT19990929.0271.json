Times News Service   \n\n   HELVETIA, Ore. _ At midday, Matt Roloff had already pounded\nnails into his four-level treehouse, mowed the soccer field, fed\nthe llamas. Now, he was eyeing the telephone pole on the farm next\ndoor. Two men in hard hats were hooking a crane to the old pole,\npreparing to pull it from the ground, but Roloff had other ideas.\n\n   ``Hey!'' he shouted across the way. ``Wait a minute! Let me take\nthat telephone pole off your hands!'' Considering that earlier in\nthe day, Roloff could not even put on his socks without the help of\nhis 3-year-old son, this pole-yanking seemed a bit ambitious.\n\n   The workers gave him the once-over. It's a dwarf! He's on\ncrutches! And he's coming our way! Roloff has heard all the jokes\nabout trolls under the bridge and crazy Munchkins, so The Look is\nnothing. He not only expects it, he plays off it.\n\n   The workers explained that somebody already had dibs on the\n30-foot pole. ``Keep me in mind,'' Roloff said, hobbling back to a\ngolf-cart-size vehicle. And you wonder: How could they not?\n\n   The Roloff farm is a 34-acre fantasy in the lustrous hill\ncountry just west of Portland. Pinot noir grapes, fat blueberries\nand computer labs are among the things that grow in the fertile\nground of Washington County. But Roloff has planted something else:\na world, built to his size, to match his imagination.\n\n   There is a full-scale pirate's ship anchored next to a pond, a\nWestern town with jail, bank, sheriff's office, general store,\nhotel and blacksmith's shop, eight bridges, a 70-foot mine shaft, a\nsoccer field, llama pens, a peach orchard, a real fire truck, four\nbarns, a 24-foot tower designed to shake and thrill and, underlying\nit all, more than 300 feet of tunnels.\n\n   It is not a commercial venture; just an idea that got seriously\nout of hand.\n\n   ``The world is what you make of it,'' he said, quoting fellow\ndwarf Linda Hunt, the actress, from the movie ``Silverado.'' ``If\nit doesn't fit, you make alterations.''\n\n   Try getting a Coke from a vending machine with money slots just\nout of reach. Or making a call from a pay phone. He talks about all\nthis in a tone devoid of self-pity. It is by way of explaining how\nhostile much of the world is to a 38-year-old man who stands 4 feet\n2 inches tall.\n\n   So, over the last decade, Roloff has been building a little\nperson's paradise, a place where nobody is ever turned away because\nthey do not meet minimum height standards.\n\n   ``If I have one gripe on this planet it is those signs at\nDisneyland that say you must be taller than a certain level to go\non this ride,'' he said. ``Maturity has nothing to do with size.''\n\n   Not long ago, Roloff got his revenge, of sorts, when a visitor\nfrom Disney dropped by the Roloff fantasy farm. ``He was\nimpressed,'' Roloff recalled. The two men ended up sharing tips on\nhow to make great-looking fake rock walls _ ``a real sandy mix of\ncement,'' he said.\n\n   Matt Roloff is a diastrophic dwarf, which means his joints are\ndeformed and deteriorating. One hip has two ball joints, and the\nother has no socket, for example. And because his condition is\ndegenerative, the clock is running. ``Every day, I become a little\nmore of a cripple,'' he said.\n\n   His wife, also 4 feet 2, is a more common achondroplastic dwarf,\nand has minimal physical problems. They have four children _ twin\nboys, age 9; a girl, 6, and the 3 year old _ all but one of whom\nare average-size. It for them, Roloff says earnestly, that he has\nspent the last decade creating the fun farm. But it is also for\nhim.\n\n   Matt Roloff was a prisoner of childhood, in the words he uses in\nhis 1999 autobiographical book, ``Against Tall Odds: Being a David\nin a Goliath World'' (Multnomah Publishers). He spent nearly five\nyears of his life either in a hospital bed or a body cast, his bent\nframe subjected to more than 15 operations for such things as\nstraightening his knees and lengthening his legs.\n\n   All he wanted were a few days playing with other children, pain\nfree. ``I used to look out my window and just dream about being Tom\nSawyer, floating away on a raft,'' he said.\n\n   The dream was put on hold while Roloff, barely out of high\nschool, built a prosperous life as a computer programmer and\nsoftware expert in the San Francisco Bay area. Along the way, he\nplayed a Munchkin in a film about the making of ``The Wizard of\nOz,'' and an Ewok in the third installment of the ``Star Wars''\nseries. He also became active in Little People of America, a\nnational organization for dwarfs.\n\n   Ten years ago, on a job-hunting excursion in Oregon, the Roloffs\nspotted a run-down farmhouse and rat-infested barn at the end of a\nroad just outside the Portland suburb of Hillsboro. ``It was a\ndump,'' Roloff recalled. They had just purchased a new home in\nCalifornia. But she was pregnant, with twins, and they did not want\ntheir children to grow up in the cramped Silicon Valley. The dream,\nlong dormant, came alive.\n\n   He looked at the contour of the land, hills and dales, an old\npeach orchard off to one side, overgrown fields of alfalfa and\nclover, and his mind raced. He started to see the 34 acres as the\nworld that had been denied him. He bought the farm for $185,000.\n\n   At first, the grand design was something the Roloffs kept to\nthemselves. But as Roloff scoured the Oregon countryside looking\nfor timbers from collapsing barns, or telephone poles, or aged\nfence posts, the neighbors became ever more curious. ``I think at\nfirst they just rolled their eyes,'' Roloff said. ``You know, look\nwhat these crazy little people from California are doing now.''\n\n   Some of what he has done, perhaps, is classic guy stuff _ the\nchromosomal impulse to build, tinker and remodel. And anyone who\nhas ever wondered why some men prefer power tools to sex can see\nthe guy-dream writ large on the Roloff farm. Nothing about it looks\ncheap or mass-manufactured, or the least bit tacky. It is all plumb\nand solidly built. Most of the project is made of reclaimed timbers\nand siding _ the kind of things Home Depot does not sell.\n\n   Somebody is always dumping off recycled wood or a load of dirt.\nOne person's hole in the ground becomes Roloff's magic mountain.\nAfter Roloff put out the word that he would like to have hills on\nhis property for future water slides and falls, contractors have\nbeen more than happy to build his creations from their excavation\nsites.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The Roloff vision started in the barn. It was reconstructed,\nfrom floorboards to roof, with old wood that Roloff picked up from\nother barns or scrap sites. Now, it is warm and inviting, with\nstraw bales for sitting, ancient clear fir beams and stairs that\nlead up to a loft of hidden nooks and crannies, book-lined and\ntoy-filled. In order to complete his plan for the barn, Roloff had\nto jack it above its foundation. And while the barn was on stilts,\nRoloff had another idea.\n\n   ``I thought, why not put a mine shaft underneath it,'' he said.\n``That would be really cool.'' So, he built a 70-foot-long mine\nshaft, which runs horizontally, just under the barn, and is\nilluminated with red lights. The children have hidden treasures in\nthe shaft.\n\n   Next, he concentrated on a place that would be perfect for a\npond. But what good is a deep swimming pond without a full-scale\npirate's ship? He found a man who had built one, but no longer had\nany use for it. Roloff purchased it for $2,500. The ``Rolly Polly''\nhas three sails, below-deck quarters for captain and crew, and a\nplank, which serves as a diving board to the pond.\n\n   Not far from the ship is a bright red 1950s vintage fire truck.\n``A guy gave that to me,'' Roloff said. ``I bought some building\nmaterials from him, and he threw in a fire truck.''\n\n   The treehouse came about in stages, like a skyscraper, rising\naround an old oak tree. The four levels are sturdy, with railing\nfor protection. But what is remarkable is that the constructed\nmaterial never actually touches the tree's branches _ it is wrapped\naround the oak. There are six ways inside the house, from ladders\nto stairs to a cargo net.\n\n   Roloff clambered up to the top floor of the treehouse, 35 feet\nabove ground. It was a strain on his joints to climb, and with\ncrutches, it seemed a feat of considerable athleticism. ``Isn't\nthis cool!'' he said. ``I built this for $500.''\n\n   The Western town is the most elaborate of the fantasy\nstructures. It has a boardwalk, and is covered with\ncinnamon-colored siding. A thick steel vault door, reclaimed from a\nmerchant in eastern Oregon, opens to the bank. The sheriff's office\nadjoins the jail. The entire town, though seemingly rock solid, is\nbuilt on skids so that it can be rearranged with the help of a\ntractor. It cost about $18,000 to build.\n\n   A warren of tunnels run beneath the town. To escape from jail,\nyou slide under a hole in the floor, and hide in the tunnels.\n``When I started digging these tunnels, my wife said, `You've\nreally gone overboard now,''' he said. But Jeremy Roloff, 9, when\nasked what his favorite part of the farm was, said, ``All the\nunderground roads _ they're great for playing hide and go seek.''\n\n   Not surprisingly, the children rarely watch television. And\ntheir friends are ``always bugging us about wanting to come over\nand play,'' Jeremy said.\n\n   Every Western town needs an Indian village _ for historic\ntension, if nothing else _ so Roloff has started work on a native\ntown, raw pine structures built in a little valley. As obsessed as\nRoloff may seem with his creations, he still works a day job. He\nsells computer applications, a job that takes him on the road for\ndays on end. He uses his tractors, backhoes and other heavy\nmachinery for much of the farm work, but he also hires carpenters,\nor relies on volunteers for help.\n\n   The house where the Roloffs live is a 1930s, somewhat\nnondescript structure full of children and music and ringing\nphones. Amy Roloff, though she appreciates the fun farm her husband\nhas built for the children, would not mind if he focused his\nenergies elsewhere.\n\n   ``Like our house,'' she said. Roloff promises that a major\nremodeling of the family home will be forthcoming. But first, he\nhas a few more things to finish.\n\n   ``Follow me,'' he said, and he scrambled to another barn, and up\na series of tiny stairs to a cupola with an eagle's view of the\nentire spread. He caught his breath.\n\n   ``Over there ... '' he trailed off, pointing to a\nhalf-constructed tower that looks like a wooden oil derrick, ``\n...I'm going to build a Tower of Terror, which will have a\n12-foot-by-12-foot platform that will teeter and drop, just enough\nto buckle your knees.''\n\n   ``And over there, I'm going to build the Titanic,'' he said. A\nsemi-submerged luxury liner requires a lot of water, so Roloff has\nalready begun digging the biggest hole yet, for a pond that will\nserve as the ocean.\n\n   There is so much to do. He plans to create a waterfall that will\ntumble down one of the big mounds of dirt, splashing into a jungle\nof plants that grow in Oregon's temperate climate _ ``like the\nGarden of Eden, but a little more fun,'' he said.\n\n   ``I do have a master plan,'' he said. ``But it's all in my head,\nand it keeps growing.''\n\n   What happens, he is asked, when the children are grown and gone,\nand he and Amy are left with the Roloff fantasy. He stared at the\n34 acres, bathed in the soft light of an Indian summer afternoon.\nFor the first time that day, he looked puzzled. ``I don't know,''\nhe said.\n","Headline":"\nA DREAM LIVES IN A GRAND DESIGN \n","Text":["\n   HELVETIA, Ore. _ At midday, Matt Roloff had already pounded\nnails into his four-level treehouse, mowed the soccer field, fed\nthe llamas.
