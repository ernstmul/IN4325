But the pilots words captured their dramatic struggle as\nthey repeatedly lost and then regained control of the plane.\n\n   Before the tapes were released, the safety board mailed a\ntranscript to the families of crash victims.\n\n   The two pilots of Flight 261, Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, and First\nOfficer William Tansky, 57, were not identified on the air traffic\ncontrol tapes.\n\n   Their first report of a problem came at 4:09:55 p.m., some 11\nminutes before the crash. Air traffic control had earlier cleared\nthe jet to maintain its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.\n\n   ``Center, Alaska 261, we are, uh, in a dive here,'' one of the\ncrew told controllers.\n\n   The control center asked Flight 261 to repeat the transmission.\n\n   ``Yeah, we're out of 26,000 feet, we're in a vertical dive _ not\na dive yet _ but, uh, we've lost vertical control of our\nairplane.''\n\n   That meant the jet had already plunged a mile from its assigned\naltitude.\n\n   Flight 261 was falling at 7,000 feet per minute, more than three\ntimes the normal rate of descent for a commercial aircraft.\n\n   Reporters who listened to the tape said the pilot who made the\ncall to controllers sounded winded, underscoring the effort it was\ntaking to control the jet.\n\n   Aviation experts have said both pilots may have been pulling\nback as hard as they could on their control columns to recover the\nplane from its initial dive when the stabilizer jammed.\n\n   The stabilizer is the winglike piece on top of the MD-83 tail\nthat is moved up or down _ ``trimmed'' _ to help keep the plane\nstable. A jetliner's nose has a tendency to pitch up or down in\nflight because of the aerodynamics of the wings.\n\n   The flight data recorder on Flight 261 that was recovered after\nthe crash showed the stabilizer jammed in the full up position,\nwhich pushed the nose down and caused the jet to suddenly dive.\nFlight 261 had plunged to about 23,700 before the crew radioed\ncontrollers they had regained some control.\n\n   `` ... we've got it back under control there,'' one of the\npilots said. But a second or two later, he added, ``No we don't.''\n\n   At 4:15:19 p.m., the crew radioed they would attempt to make an\nemergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport. The jet was\nat 22,500 feet.\n\n   ``L.A., Alaska 261, uh, we're with you, we're at\ntwenty-two-five, we have a jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining\naltitude with difficulty, uh, but, uh, we can maintain altitude we\nthink and our intention is to land at Los Angeles.''\n\n   The control tower asked the crew what they wanted to do. The\ncrew said they wanted to descend to about 10,000 feet and remain\nover the water when they put the flaps down for landing (change\nconfiguration).\n\n   ``Center, Alaska 261, I need to, uh, get down about ten, change\nmy configuration, make sure I can control the jet and I'd like to\ndo that out here over the bay if I may.''\n\n   After the jet was cleared down to 17,000 feet, the crew made the\nfinal transmission to controllers. It was 4:17 p.m.\n\n   ``Thank you,'' one of the pilots said.\n\n   Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, previously said that\nwhen the plane was at about 18,000 feet, ``things began to happen\nvery quickly.'' The jet was flying at 270 knots, with its nose\npitched down 2.7 degrees and the stabilizer in the full nose-down\ntrim position.\n\n   At this point, the pilots extended the flaps to 11 degrees.\n(Flaps are extended for landing to provide more lift.)\n\n   Four seconds after the beginning of the flap deployment, Hall\nsaid, the plane began to fall out of control. Its nose pitched down\nat 26 degrees a second, eventually reaching 70 degrees. The plane\nexperienced a negative force of 3 ``G's,'' or three times the force\nof gravity.\n\n   Flight 261 rolled into an inverted dive and plunged into the\nocean in about a minute. The air traffic control tapes captured\nthat final dive from the perspective of several pilots in planes\nflying in the area.\n\n   After the pilot of the corporate jet radioed that the Alaska\nplane had just started to make a ``big, huge plunge,'' the pilot of\nthe Sky West jet radioed that Flight 261 was ``nose down'' and\n``descending quite rapidly, definitely out of control.''\n\n   A Navy air controller at the Point Mugu, Calif., Naval Air\nWeapons Center, watched on his radar as the jet plunged into the\nocean. His voice is also heard on the tapes, calling out the jet's\naltitude.\n\n   ``He's at 7,600 feet ... He's at 5,700 (feet) right now 4,600.''\n\n   The jet hit the water a few miles off Point Mugu some 11 minutes\nafter the crew had first reported the initial dive.\n\n   Neither the FAA nor the safety board would comment on the tapes.\n\n   Alaska posted an employee notice on its Web site that the tapes\nwere being released.\n\n   ``While this information is very personal to all of us, the\nongoing National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the\naccident inhibits what we and others can say so it would be\ninappropriate at this time ... to comment on the tapes or\ntranscripts,'' Alaska said in the notice.\n\n   It warned ``there will be a high level of coverage and the tapes\nare likely to be played repeatedly. The coverage may be cold and\nfactual or sensational. But it will have great meaning for the\nfamilies of all of those lost and for all of us here at Alaska\nAirlines.''\n\n   In addition to the safety board probe into the cause of the\ncrash, Alaska Airlines is the subject of a federal criminal\ninvestigation of its maintenance practices.\n\n   Questions also have been raised by investigators about\nmaintenance work done on the jackscrew mechanism that controlled\nthe movement of the stabilizer on the plane that crashed.\n\n   The jackscrew is located inside the 40-foot long stabilizer and\nruns up and down through a large fixed gimbal nut. Hall has said no\ngrease was found on the operational part of the jackscrew, although\nAlaska claims pictures of the jackscrew show there was grease on\nit.\n\n   The threads of the nut were found stripped, and metal shreds of\nthe same material were found on the 22-inch-long jackscrew\nrecovered from the ocean.\n\n   The flight data recorder suggests that the problem with the\nstabilizer started early in the flight, but was not considered\nserious enough for the pilots to land the plane. The stabilizer\napparently would only move in one direction _ one that caused the\nplane's nose to want to pitch down. The pilots would have had to\ncounter this using the elevators that are attached to the rear of\nthe stabilizer.\n\n   It is not all that unusual for a modern-day commercial jetliner\nto experience minor stabilizer problems during flight.\n\n   But on Flight 261, the problem turned deadly serious when the\nstabilzier jammed in the full nose-down position.\n\n   Aviation experts say the final dive from which the pilots did\nnot recover may have been caused when the jammed jackscrew ran\nsuddenly through mechanical stops and the stabilizer deflected to\nan extreme position.\n\n   The safety board is expected to hold its initial hearing into\nthe cause of the crash later this year. That hearing may be held on\nthe West Coast.\n\n   A transcript of what can be heard on the jet's cockpit voice\nrecorder is likely to be released at that hearing.\n\n   The board is prohibited by law from releasing the tape from a\ncockpit voice recorder. In the case of Flight 261, the cockpit\nvoice recorder captured the final 30 minutes of conversations\nbetween Capt. Thompson and First Officer Tansky.\n\n   The board also has not yet released tapes of conversations the\ntwo pilots had with Alaska personnel on the ground in Seattle and\nin Los Angeles as they tried to troubleshoot the stabilizer\nproblem.\n\n   Even though they had already radioed their thanks to\ncontrollers, Thompson and Tansky were still talking to an Alaska\nmechanic when their jet made its final, inverted dive toward the\nPacific.\n","Headline":"\nAIR TRAFFIC TAPES FROM ALASKA FLIGHT 261 CAPTURE DRAMATIC\nSTRUGGLE \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ The last radio transmission from the pilots of Alaska\nAirlines Flight 261 to air traffic controllers was a calm ``thank\nyou.''\n","\n   Then controllers heard only chilling reports from pilots of\nother planes who watched the Alaska jet make a horrifying, inverted\ndive into the Pacific Ocean from 17,900 feet.\n","\n   ``That plane has just started to do a huge plunge,'' the pilot\nof a corporate jet flying in the same area radioed controllers at\n4:19:39 p.m., according to air traffic control tapes released\nWednesday in Washington, D.C.\n","\n   Less than a minute later, he added: ``Plane's inverted, sir.''\n","\n   That was followed by this transmission from the crew of a Sky\nWest jet at 4:20:59 p.m.:\n","\n   ``He, ah, hit the water, he's down.''\n","\n   For the first time, the Federal Aviation Administration made\npublic a transcript of the taped conversations between the doomed\njet and air traffic controllers that began soon after Flight 261\ntook off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to Seattle, with a scheduled\nstop in San Francisco.\n","\n   All 88 people aboard the MD-83 jetliner, including about 50 from\nWashington state, died in the Jan. 31 crash off the California\ncoast.\n","\n   The tapes confirmed much of what is already known about the\naccident from briefings by the National Transportation Safety\nBoard.
