Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ During his first campaign for the Senate, Al Gore\nwas asked by the Nashville Banner in 1984 whether he could support\n``stiff controls'' on firearm sales and ownership. His answer was a\nresolute ``no.''\n\n   ``I do not believe that such measures would keep handguns out of\nthe hands of criminals,'' said Gore, then a four-term congressman\nfrom a rural Tennessee district who earned an ``A'' rating from the\nNational Rifle Association that year.\n\n   But in 1987, when Gore was running his first campaign for\npresident, he gave a very different answer to gun control advocates\nseeking his support on Senate legislation to ban plastic guns.\n\n   ``He wanted to do whatever it took to reduce gun violence,''\nsaid Sarah Brady, the president of Handgun Control Inc. From that\ntime, she has viewed Gore as one of her movement's staunchest\nsupporters.\n\n   This year, Gore has placed gun control at the center of his\ncampaign for president. He has attacked his Republican opponent,\nGov. George W. Bush of Texas, as a pawn of the NRA and proposed an\narray of tough laws, including licensing new handgun buyers,\nlimiting gun sales to one a month and banning inexpensive and\neasily concealed handguns.\n\n   But in promoting his own gun agenda, Gore's campaign has largely\nairbrushed away his early record in Congress of fighting\ngun-control legislation. To Gore's critics, his stark evolution\nfrom NRA ally to enemy provides clear evidence that on contentious\nissues like gun control, abortion and smoking, Gore has molded his\nviews to fit political needs.\n\n   ``He was positioning himself for national office,'' said Sen.\nLarry Craig, R-Idaho, an NRA board member. ``I've watched him make\nvery calculated decisions on issues to build a national base. Gun\ncontrol was one.''\n\n   Gore and his supporters argue that his embrace of gun control\nwas a heartfelt response to a rising tide of gun violence in the\nlate 1980s. Gore himself credits Sarah Brady _ whose husband,\nJames, was partly paralyzed in 1981 by a bullet meant for President\nReagan _ with helping to change his views.\n\n   ``The views of many people, not just elected officials, have\nevolved on this issue as gun violence has become more prevalent,''\nsaid Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager for\ncommunications.\n\n   Bush has been more consistent on the issue than Gore, and for\nyears has been seen as a reliable ally of the NRA. As governor of\nTexas, he has signed into law several major bills the association\nsupported, including one allowing people with handgun licenses to\ncarry concealed weapons and another prohibiting municipalities from\nsuing gun manufacturers.\n\n   NRA officials said it was virtually certain that the group would\nendorse Bush this fall and throw millions of dollars behind his\ncampaign.\n\n   In explaining his opposition to stringent gun control, Bush\noften asserts that a well-armed populace is an effective deterrent\nto crime. ``I believe this legislation is helping make Texas a\nsafer place to live,'' he wrote in a letter to a voter this year\nthat defended letting more people carry concealed firearms.\n\n   A review of Gore's record over 24 years suggests that his\njourney through the gun-control wars has been more complicated than\neither his supporters or critics imagine. Indeed, many people\nsuspect that Gore, a one-time divinity school student, actually\nsupported gun controls before he entered office. But cautious and\npragmatic to the bone, he behaved like most other Tennessee\nDemocrats when he became a politician, expressing opposition to gun\nlaws.\n\n   In Gore's first campaign for Congress in 1976, for instance, he\nindicated to the Nashville Banner, the more conservative of the\ncity's two daily newspapers, that he would not support new gun\ncontrol laws. When the paper endorsed him, Gore reprinted and\ndistributed the editorial, which included a glowing reference to\nhis opposition to gun restrictions.\n\n   Yet Gore also muddied his position with mixed messages. In an\ninterview that same year with the city's more liberal newspaper,\nThe Tennessean, where Gore had earlier worked as a reporter and\neditorial writer, he claimed that the Banner had oversimplified his\npositions. Instead of opposing gun control wholesale, he told the\npaper, he was open to certain restrictions, including one he\nadvocates today: a ban on the cheap handguns known as Saturday\nNight Specials.\n\n   Friends and colleagues say they think that Gore stifled or\nconcealed those pro-gun control sentiments during the 1976\ncampaign, fearing that he would anger voters in the 4th\nCongressional District, a staunchly Democratic but socially\nconservative swathe of hamlets, rolling forests and tobacco farms\nin middle Tennessee.\n\n   ``My thinking is that he wavered on gun control,'' said Lloyd\nArmour, who was Gore's boss on the Tennessean's editorial page.\n``But you had to recall that he was from a very conservative, I\nmean very conservative, district. He could not have survived if he\nhad been as forthright as he is now.''\n\n   If Gore was conflicted on the issue during the 1976 campaign,\nhis early voting record in Washington was not. During his first\ndecade in Congress, Gore steadfastly opposed gun restrictions,\nwinning ``A'' or ``A-'' ratings from the NRA in three of his first\nfive campaigns. And though it appears that he did not receive\ncampaign contributions from the NRA, the group says it mailed\nliterature praising his record to its members in his district.\n\n   ``I don't think he was a stand up, rah-rah, pro-gun congressman\nor senator,'' said James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist. ``But\nhe was a solid vote for us, which those grades indicate.''\n\n   Among his key votes in the House, Gore supported efforts to stop\nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from creating a system\nof serial numbers to be used to trace weapons. The NRA argued that\nthe system was a first step toward national gun registration. Gore\nagreed, and voted to cut the bureau's budget by $4.2 million,\nkilling the plan.\n\n   After winning election to the Senate in 1984, Gore continued to\nbe a reliable vote for the NRA. In his first year, he supported the\ngun lobby's most prized goal of the decade: a sweeping repeal of\nfederal gun laws that had been enacted after the murders of Sen.\nRobert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King in 1968. Gore's\nfather, Albert, had voted for those restrictions in the Senate.\n\n   The repeal measure called for ending federal restrictions on the\ninterstate sale and transport of guns, restricting the government's\nability to seize weapons and significantly limiting the\ngovernment's ability to inspect firearms dealers.\n\n   With Gore and most other southern Democrats voting for it, the\nFirearm Owners Protection Act, as it was known, sailed through the\nSenate by a 79-15 vote. To this day, Gore contends that the measure\ncontained positive provisions that made it worth supporting,\nincluding tougher penalties for crimes committed with guns.\n\n   But gun control advocates view the law as one of their worst\nsetbacks in decades, even though some of its most far-reaching\nprovisions were removed during negotiations with the House.\n\n   nn\n\n   Following enactment of the repeal measure, Gore continued to\nexpress deep skepticism about gun control, telling the Washington\nMonthly magazine in 1986 that ``gun laws haven't been an effective\nsolution to the underlying problem of violent crime.''\n\n   But by 1987, as crack fueled a surge in gun violence, public\nsentiment began to shift in favor of stricter gun laws. Congress\nbegan to feel the pressure, and police organizations joined the\nranks of gun control advocates, giving lawmakers political cover to\noppose the NRA.\n\n   When Sarah Brady called Gore that year to solicit his support\nfor the ban on plastic guns, he readily agreed. Though he was\nabsent for the vote, when the measure failed, he co-sponsored\nsimilar legislation the following year.\n\n   Republican opponents and other critics say Gore had an\nadditional motivation for switching sides just then: In the spring\nof 1987, he had jumped into the presidential campaign. Two leading\nDemocratic candidates, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, were\nstrong proponents of gun control, and, his critics assert, Gore was\ntrolling for votes in New York and New England, places where\nregulating guns was popular. Gore denies that.\n\n   Though his presidential campaign collapsed in early 1988, Gore's\nadvocacy for gun control grew stronger. In 1990, he helped\nnegotiate a bill banning certain semiautomatic weapons, and urged\nhis fellow Tennessee Democrat, Sen. Jim Sasser, to support it.\n\n   His critics say Gore tried to have it both ways on the assault\nweapons ban, voting against an amendment to extend the ban to more\nweapons, then voting for the final bill. But gun-control advocates\nsay the amendment was a ``poison-pill'' that could have killed the\noverall bill.\n\n   In 1991, Gore co-sponsored legislation named after James Brady\nthat required a five-day waiting period for handgun buyers. Six\nyears before, Gore had voted against similar legislation. This\ntime, he rose to give one of his only floor speeches on gun control\nduring 16 years in Congress.\n\n   ``Violence in this country and violence with guns is a problem\nthat must be addressed not next month, not next year, but now,''\nGore said, in a losing cause.\n\n   But even as Gore was working for passage of the Brady Bill in\nWashington, his staff was telling reporters in Tennessee that Gore\nwas undecided about the measure, according to news accounts in\nNashville papers.\n\n   Both the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill were defeated in\nCongress those years. But during the Clinton administration,\nCongress passed both bills and they were signed into law. And last\nyear, Gore cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation to require\nbackground checks for gun buyers at gun shows. The gun show bill is\nnow stalled in negotiations between the House and Senate.\n\n   Republicans say Gore's shifting views on gun control have raised\nnew questions about his candidness and credibility. But gun control\nadvocates say what matters most is that Gore is staunchly in their\ncamp today.\n\n   ``His constituents may have influenced his early votes,'' Sarah\nBrady said. ``But once he gave it some thought, he supported gun\ncontrol, for the right reasons.''\n","Headline":"\nON GUN CONTROL, GORE HAS GONE FROM OPPONENT TO ADVOCATE \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ During his first campaign for the Senate, Al Gore\nwas asked by the Nashville Banner in 1984 whether he could support\n``stiff controls'' on firearm sales and ownership.
