Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on\nthe Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says\nin a report to be released on Monday.\n\n   The report proposes outlawing technologies like the\ncontroversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade\nmusic files with little regard to copyrights.\n\n   The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the\nDemocratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief,\n``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business\nCommittee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music\ntechnologies.\n\n   The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels\nand lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and\ndownloadable music to gain market share. Scheduled witnesses\ninclude Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal\nproponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3. At\nRapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known\nartists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.\n\n   But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its\nreport, will also focus attention on what it says are needed\nupdates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\n   That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright\nprotections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of\nInternet access services and search services from liability when\ntheir users transmit pirated works.\n\n   Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online\nservice, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits\nfrom major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the\nrap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious\ncopyright infringement. The groups are seeking damages that could\nadd up to billions of dollars.\n\n   Napster's software works like a co-op. It enables users to swap\nsongs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression\nformula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files. Record\ncompanies call it a haven for piracy because it enables\ndistribution of music without any copyright protection.\n\n   ``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the\nlaw intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted\nthat way,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, director of the institute and\na co-author of the report. ``So we just say, let's tighten the\nlaw.'' ``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service\nprovider.''\n\n   The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended\n``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for\ncopyright violations while maintaining protections from liability\nfor service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital\npiracy.''\n\n   The report proposes that services like Napster be required to\ncollect identifiable and verifiable information from its users,\nsuch as addresses and credit-card information. And it recommends\nthat the services be required to remove infringing users within a\nspecific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.\n\n   Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its\nusers illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because\nit does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in\ntrading copyrighted music. Recently, however, Napster did bar\n300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the\nfans had infringed its copyrights using the service.\n\n   Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the\nrecommendations in his report.
