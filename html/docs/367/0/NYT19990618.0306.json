The bill dealt with gun shows but would have weakened\nexisting laws governing background checks.\n\n   ``The American people will not stand for this'' President\nClinton said in a statement. ``Our nation is waiting for Washington\nto pass a real law that keeps guns away from children and out of\nthe hands of criminals. I call on the Congress to stop playing\npolitics and start living up to its responsibility to help save\nlives.''\n\n   But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., accused the Democrats\nof turning their backs on ``a sensible'' gun-control measure when\nthey had the chance to pass the first significant bill dealing with\nfirearms legislation since Congress banned the sale of assault\nweapons in 1994.\n\n   ``Let there be no mistake,'' Hastert countered, ``the vast\nmajority of the Democrat caucus walked away when they had the\nchance to walk forward for the good of the country.''\n\n   All but 10 Democrats did end up voting against the bill, but so\ndid 82 Republicans, who rejected Hastert's pleas that they rally\nbehind some form of gun control to show their concern about what\nhappened two months ago in Littleton, Colo.\n\n     \n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   All 17 Texas Democrats voted against the bill, as did\nRepublicans Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Joe Barton of Dallas,\nLarry Combest of Lubbock, Sam Johnson of Plano, Ron Paul of\nSurfside and Mac Thornberry of Clarendon.\n\n     \n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   Critics of the House bill found particularly objectionable a\nprovision approved late Thursday night by a vote of 218-211 that\nwould have extended the current instant background check to guns\nsold by unlicensed dealers at firearms shows, but set a deadline of\nonly 24 hours for completing checks before the purchaser got the\ngun anyway.\n\n     \n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)   \n  \n\n   All 13 of the Texas Republicans voted for that provision, the\nstate's Democrats split over it, with nine of them also voting in\nfavor of it.

The House has also passed a\nseparate $1.5 billion juvenile justice measure designed to crack\ndown on minors who commit violent crimes.
