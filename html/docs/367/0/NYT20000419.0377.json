{"DocumentId":"NYT20000419.0377","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"0","Body":" BC-GUN-CONTROL-SFCHRON \nCOLUMBINE RECASTS GUN CONTROL DEBATE\n\n         By HARRIET CHIANG  \n c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  \n\n   A year ago, Daniel Mauser told his father he was concerned about\na loophole in the Brady law that he felt made it too easy for\npeople to buy guns.\n\n   It was only a passing remark, and Tom Mauser didn't give it much\nthought. But two weeks later, his 15-year-old son was gunned down\nin the school library by two students on a deadly shooting spree in\na quiet Denver suburb.\n\n   It is a year later, and Tom Mauser, who is still mourning his\nson's death, is a passionate gun-control advocate.\n\n   ``I want to do something in his name,'' Mauser said of Daniel, a\nshy, slender teenager who was good in math and science and loved\nvideogames but didn't know what he wanted to do when he grew up.\n\n   Thursday is the first anniversary of the massacre at Columbine\nHigh School in Littleton, Colo. On that day two heavily armed\nteenagers stormed the school shortly before noon and during an\nhourlong rampage shot to death 12 students and a teacher before\nkilling themselves. While gun-wielding students have attacked\nclassmates and teachers at other suburban schools, Columbine stands\nas the worst school massacre in the nation's history.\n\n   Images of a school turned into a bloody battlefield still\nlinger, a haunting reminder for parents who saw their greatest fear\nbecome reality.\n\n   But the legal impact has been limited. Several states, including\nCalifornia, passed gun control legislation. But during the same\nperiod, the gun lobby successfully pushed through bills that\nprotect the industry from lawsuits in 17 states.\n\n   Some 31 cities and counties are pursuing lawsuits against the\nindustry. But legislation on the federal level has all but stalled\nin Congress.\n\n   Although success with legislation has been limited, gun control\nadvocates say the school siege has prompted an unprecedented public\noutcry. National polls since Columbine show a majority of Americans\nfavor stronger regulations of guns and stricter enforcement of\ncurrent laws. The fervor that has long driven the pro-gun lobby\n   those who oppose limits on guns is now driving gun control\nadvocates.\n\n   ``There's a change in intensity,'' said Luis Tolley, western\ndirector of Handgun Control. Columbine, he said, shattered the myth\nthat gun violence is a problem limited to cities, minorities and\ngangs.\n\n   ``Every parent in the country became concerned about sending\ntheir child to school,'' he said. People who had passively\nsupported gun control now are motivated to take an active role in a\nburgeoning crusade against gun violence, Tolley said.\n\n   Daniel's father said he supported gun-control laws before the\nshooting ``but I never did anything about it.'' After the shooting,\nMauser took a leave from his job as a manager for the Colorado\nTransportation Department and is now director of political affairs\nfor SAFE Colorado, a bipartisan group formed after the killings.\n\n   ``I feel like I should do something to help close that\nloophole,'' he said.\n\n   Such changes, say legal experts, may take time.\n\n   ``As a symbolic passage in the American gun battle, (Columbine)\nis enormously important,'' Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl\nWarren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley,\nsaid. But in the short term, he said, it might have a greater\nimpact on the politics surrounding gun control than on laws\nregulating the industry.\n\n   For their part, gun advocates dismiss the notion of Columbine as\na catalyst for change. While the school rampage intensified media\ncoverage, they say the public remains skeptical that more curbs on\nfirearms will stop the seemingly endless stream of violent crimes.\n\n   Instead of favoring new restrictions, voters support stronger\nenforcement of existing laws, gun advocates say.\n\n   The two killers at Columbine broke 19 state and federal laws,\nsaid Ed Worley, California liaison for the National Rifle\nAssociation. ``Would having one more law on the books stop the\nanimals from doing what they did?'' he asked.\n\n   The gun-control advocates and the NRA represent old adversaries\nin a struggle over guns that for years has split along traditional\npolitical lines. Republicans generally have supported the\nconstitutional rights of gun owners while Democrats have backed\nregulations that they say will help keep guns out of the hands of\nkillers.\n\n   Both sides insist they are morally and legally right, and they\ntrot out polls to show that they have the support of the American\npeople.\n\n   But Columbine blurred the lines between supporters and opponents\nof gun controls, especially among lawmakers.\n\n   In Congress, gun advocates and opponents have been locked in a\nyearlong stalemate, each side blaming the other for being unwilling\nto compromise.\n\n   So far, legislation proposed by gun-control advocates in the\nRepublican-controlled Congress has been, for the most part, small\nchange, said Zimring at Berkeley. ``For $1.50 of gun control,\n(Democrats) want $1 million impact,'' he said.\n\n   Immediately after Columbine, the U.S. Senate passed a series of\nmodest gun control measures, including a ban on sales to minors and\na requirement of safety locks on handguns. But the measures haven't\nbudged from a House-Senate conference committee, which met only\nonce, in August.\n\n   ``Sadly, it's all politics,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, a\nconservative Republican from Florida who has opposed previous gun\ncontrol measures. ``Both sides don't want to have a bill,'' he\nsaid. ``They seem to want an election issue and not legislation.''\n\n   With nothing to show after a year's worth of effort, the House\nlast week overwhelmingly passed legislation sponsored by McCollum\nthat would provide $100 million to states that impose mandatory\nprison terms for criminals caught with a gun.\n\n   Some Democrats dismiss the bill as minor legislation that will\ndo little to reduce gun violence.\n\n   Gun control advocates say they have had far greater success on\nthe state and local level. In the past year, eight states have\npassed gun control laws and three traditionally pro-gun states _\nColorado, Utah and Oregon _ have proposed initiatives.\n\n   Republican governors in New York, Colorado, Illinois and Ohio\nwho were considered conservatives on regulation have come out in\nsupport of gun-control legislation. Meanwhile, 31 cities and\ncounties, including San Francisco, are pursuing lawsuits against\nthe industry.\n\n   The undisputed leader in the gun control movement has been\nCalifornia, which passed five major laws after Columbine, including\nthe nation's most comprehensive assault weapons ban.\n\n   Days after the Colorado massacre, the Assembly narrowly approved\na measure that would limit the purchase of handguns to one a month.\nLawmakers rejected a similar bill two years before, but this time,\nwith the horror of Columbine still fresh in their minds, they\napproved the restriction.\n\n   Gun advocates say that the key to the passage of the gun control\nlaws was not Columbine but the 1998 election of a Democratic\ngovernor as well as a Democratic-controlled Senate and Assembly.\n\n   ``This is all stuff that they've been trying to get through for\nyears,'' said Gerald Upholt, manager of governmental affairs for\nthe California Rifle and Pistol Association, which had opposed each\nof the laws.\n\n   While those favoring gun control agree that Davis' support was\ncritical, they see this as an issue that crosses party lines.\n\n   ``We feel very strongly that gun safety is a kid issue,'' said\nAssemblywoman Dion Aroner, the Berkeley Democrat who co-sponsored a\nsafety locks bill. ``That's what Columbine said to everybody.''\n\n   And where there are children, there are parents. So while the\nusual political adversaries continue to spar, a powerful new\nlobbying force has entered the gun debate.\n\n   On Mother's Day, May 14, sponsors of the Million Mom March\nexpect more than 150,000 people to descend on Washington, D.C., to\nrally in favor of gun regulations. Backers say a total of 1 million\nmothers and their families are expected to demonstrate at the\nnation's capital and at satellite rallies in 30 cities, including\nOakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles. And not all of them will be\nDemocrats.\n\n   ``It's going to be the gun movement's Woodstock'' said Mary\nLeigh Blek,cq     an honorary chair of the march. Blek, a lifelong\nRepublican from Orange County, has been working for gun regulations\never since her 21-year-old son, Matthew, was shot to death during a\nrobbery in 1994.\n\n   ``To me this is a nonpartisan issue,'' said Blek, western\nregional director of the Bell Campaign, a grass-roots group\nstriving for gun laws on the local, state and national level. She\nsaid that many Republican women support gun control laws, unlike\nmany of the party leaders.\n\n   ``The Million Mom March is going to show our power,'' she said.\n\n   Nonetheless, gun advocates have had the power for years, and\nthey point to some legislation in the past year that shows they\nstill have considerable political might: a ban on cities and\ncounties suing the gun industry.\n\n   The legislation has passed in 17 states and is pending in two\nmore.\n\n   ``The American people don't have a very strong belief that gun\ncontrol laws are effective in solving gun violence,'' said Jim\nManown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax,\nVa. ``I don't think any of these tragic incidents have resulted in\nany change in public opinion.''\n\n   Meanwhile, he said that support for the NRA has never been\nstronger. The organization boasts a membership of 3.5 million, with\n300,000 new members joining since the beginning of the year.\n\n   Mauser, Daniel's father, who has been working in support of a\nColorado initiative aimed at closing the loophole that allows those\nwho purchase guns at gun shows to avoid background checks, said he\ninitially was frustrated after state lawmakers failed to pass the\nmeasure.\n\n   But he said his job managing transit for a car-loving state\nprepared him ``for the realities of being a David against\nGoliath.''\n\n   ``I don't know what it's going to take to stop the gun\nviolence,'' he said. ``Obviously it's going to take a lot.''\n","Headline":"\nCOLUMBINE RECASTS GUN CONTROL DEBATE\n","Text":["\n   A year ago, Daniel Mauser told his father he was concerned about\na loophole in the Brady law that he felt made it too easy for\npeople to buy guns.\n","\n   It was only a passing remark, and Tom Mauser didn't give it much\nthought.
