All over.\n\n   Why in the world would anyone want an ornament there?\n\n   I don't want to seem like a prude, because the truth is I'm more\na chicken than anything else. But what could these people be\nthinking? I mean, how does one decide to put an earring in their\ntongue or navel or nipples? What kind of conversation, if any,\ncould go on in their heads?\n\n   It's so tempting to be sarcastic, but this is no laughing\nmatter. Along with being a very popular fad, especially among\nteen-agers, body piercing can be quite hazardous to your health,\nnot to mention your social standing.\n\n   For instance, The Times reported that one young woman was fired\nfrom a law firm because the rest of the staff was so repulsed by\nher facial piercings.\n\n   That's enough to make me weep, because I'm against\ndiscrimination of any kind. At the same time, this is an example of\njust the thing to do if you don't really want your job.\n\n   Recently, I was in a restaurant and the person taking my order\nhad a ring in her tongue. She has a right to work, but I have a\nright to my appetite. One look and suddenly I didn't feel hungry\nanymore.\n\n   I mentioned health risks. The list is long.\n\n   Allergic reaction to jewelry is the most common culprit.
