But on every other front, the\nrecord companies are losing.\n\n   The MP3.com Web site faces millions in damages for providing\nunauthorized recordings of pop tunes. Meanwhile, the Internet music\nservice Napster is fighting for its life. This week the company\nreturns to federal court to fend off an injunction that would force\nit to stop its members from trading illegal music files. In both\ncases, federal judges have made it clear that music pirates can\nexpect severe penalties at the bar of justice.\n\n   But the public's appetite for Internet music just keeps growing.\nNapster's user base rose from 1.1 million users in February to 4.9\nmillion in July. And other music trading services like Gnutella and\nAimster are also flourishing.\n\n   It's gotten so bad that Sony Music Entertainment must fight off\ndefections among its own musical artists. The Los Angeles Times on\nFriday reported that The Offspring, one of Sony's more popular\nacts, will give away free digital copies of its new album on the\nInternet, in an effort to drum up more sales for the CD, which\nisn't due out for another month. Sony executives expressed ``very\nreal concerns'' about the wisdom of the plan.\n\n   The Offspring's move only underscores the perception that the\nworld's five major music companies _ Sony, BMG Entertainment, EMI\nRecorded Music, Universal Music Group, and the Warner Music Group _\nare taking their sweet time about offering consumers a legal way to\nget music over the Internet.\n\n   It's an old story. Up pops a new technology that threatens a\nwell-established industry and offers vast new opportunities. But\ncomplacency or fear of change prevails, and the established\nbusiness rejects the breakthrough, with disastrous results.\n\n   Probably the most spectacular example involved the Internet of\nthe 19th century. In 1877, Gardiner Hubbard, an executive from a\nsmall start-up company, made an offer to an industrial titan.\nHubbard was willing to sell his business for $100,000 to the\ncorporate bigwig _ William Orton, president of Western Union Co.\nOrton declined. He already had a strong business, and nobody needed\nto transmit voices over a wire. Owning the Bell Telephone Co. would\nbe a waste of time.\n\n   At times, it seems as though the music moguls are as myopic as\nOrton. Napster's success proves there's a vast market for digital\ntunes. So why isn't the recording industry scrambling to sell its\nmusic that way?\n\n   ``For a while, the answer was they were afraid to do it,'' says\nEric Scheirer, a digital entertainment analyst with Forrester\nResearch in Cambridge.\n\n   And with good reason. A customer might pay for the latest MP3\nfrom Aerosmith but then decide to share it with friends. Soon\nthousands of perfect digital copies have been made from the\noriginal, and neither Aerosmith nor their record label sees a penny\nof profit.\n\n   But Scheirer says the industry's fear of digital music is slowly\nstarting to wane, as it begins to consider technology that could\nprevent wholesale music piracy. But whether the recording industry\nis really ready to embrace the Internet, after decades of\ncontrolling music distribution on its own terms, remains to be\nseen. And even if the industry does move in that direction, it\nstill must overcome some formidable hurdles that may further delay\nany major changes in the way it does business.\n\n   Music executives think they can solve the piracy problem with a\ntechnology called ``digital rights management'' or DRM. The system\nlocks a digital music file inside special encryption software that\nrenders it unplayable unless it's paid for.\n\n   Several companies have developed systems that attach DRM data to\ncompressed music files, and MP3 playback devices and software are\nadding the ability to recognize DRM-encoded files. But DRM has a\nlarge loophole. Consumers can still buy the music on old-fashioned\nCDs, and make pirated MP3 copies of that.\n\n   The recording and consumer electronics industries think they've\ngot the beginnings of an answer. The Secure Digital Music\nInitiative is a consortium of 200 firms that has begun to build a\nsystem to make CDs virtually piracy-proof.\n\n   SDMI uses a ``digital watermark,'' a silent digital data stream\nthat can be permanently embedded in a file. The makers of digital\nmusic players such as Sony Electronics will include software that\nrecognizes the SDMI watermark.\n\n   When a CD track is converted to MP3, the music is compressed.\nThis alters the watermark. An SDMI-compliant device will detect the\nchange and refuse to play back the file. SDMI discs can also\ninclude digital rights management. It might allow the user to make\none or two digital copies, but no more.\n\n   The SDMI system is being introduced in two phases, with the\nfull-fledged version expected to appear next year. With nearly\nevery major player in music, software, and home electronics on\nboard, eventually all music products will use SDMI as a matter of\ncourse. Even would-be cheaters will be hard-pressed to find a music\nplayer or CD that doesn't use the watermarking system.\n\n   But a similar antipiracy effort launched by the computer\nsoftware industry in the 1980s failed miserably. Firms added ``copy\nprotection'' features to their software disks, to stop illegal\ncopying. But copy protection often made it impossible to reinstall\nsoftware after a system crash, or make an emergency backup.\nConsumers hated it.\n\n   More important, hackers soon found ways to defeat the\ntechnology, causing the software industry to abandon the idea.\n\n   Scheirer foresees the same woes for SDMI and digital rights\nmanagement.\n\n   ``These rules are about preventing the consumer from doing what\nhe wants to do,'' he says. People will try to crack the systems,\nand Scheirer bets someone will succeed.\n\n   SDMI hopes to forestall this by holding a contest in which\nhackers can win $10,000 if they outwit the watermarking technology.\nBut the hacker community has reacted with sneering contempt. Don\nMarti, the technical editor of Linux Journal, a popular technology\npublication, has written an open letter to SDMI urging fellow\nhackers not to take part in the challenge.\n\n   But suppose the security features do work. Can we expect a new\nera of low-cost, legitimate digital music? Not just yet. There's\nanother barrier to overcome _ the musicians themselves.\n\n   ``You need to get permissions and clearances and copyrights,\nstuff that companies like Napster never have to do,'' says Cary\nSherman, general counsel of the Recording Industry Association of\nAmerica.\n\n   For example, many contracts include clauses that limit the\nissuance of individual cuts from an album.\n\n   There are also artists whose contracts forbid ``coupling'' _ the\npractice of combining songs from several different performers into\na single album.\n\n   And every contract is different. So the big five recording firms\nmust review each contract, and renegotiate many of them, before\ndistributing music on the Internet.\n\n   Warner Music Group says it has 1,000 albums ready for digital\ndistribution, but had to review the artists' contracts before they\ncould be released. These albums will become available online\nstarting in November.\n\n   But the artists aren't the only ones who must be placated.\n\n   ``You've also got existing retail relationships you want to\npreserve,'' notes Sherman of the RIAA.\n\n   Major dealers like Tower Records and Sam Goody, small\nmom-and-pop record shops, big regional distributors _ all of them\nwill be threatened by a move to Internet music sales.\n\n   And the recording industry can't afford to alienate them,\nbecause until they've made the transition to online selling, most\nof their profits will still come from over-the-counter sales of\nplastic discs.\n\n   Keeping their partners happy while preparing to cut them off at\nthe knees will require the business cunning of Bill Gates and the\nnegotiating skill of Jesse Jackson.\n\n   Meanwhile, ``they've lost a lot of the leverage they had in\ncontrolling distribution,'' says Scheirer.\n\n   With digital music, artists no longer need the record companies\nand their distribution chains to get their products to the public.\nGranted, lesser-known bands still need promotion and marketing, but\nnew independent firms like Digital Brandcasting of Los Angeles are\nalready springing up to provide this service to Internet-based\nbands.
