By Sue Grafton. Henry Holt and Co. $25. 289\npages.\n\n   Picking up a new Kinsey Millhone alphabet mystery is like\nsitting down to eat comfort food _ almost always satisfying, unless\na key ingredient is missing. And ``N'' is missing Santa Teresa,\nKinsey's hometown.\n\n   Kinsey drives to Nota Lake, Calif., to meet with Selma Newquist,\nwhose police officer husband had recently died of a heart attack.\nSelma has accepted the coroner's report. After all, Tom Newquist\nwas in his mid-60s, worked too hard, smoked too much and loved junk\nfood. But Tom was moody and withdrawn the last six weeks of his\nlife and Selma wants to know why.\n\n   Accepting the case, Kinsey figures she'll only have to spend a\ncouple of days in Nota Lake. As she starts asking questions, Tom's\nfellow officers and friends all say the same thing _ Tom was a\ngreat guy and had no problems. And they all dislike Selma, so they\nare not very helpful.

St. Martin's Press.\n$24.95.\n\n   Coonts' latest military thriller delivers on all fronts _ in the\nair, on land, and under the sea.\n\n   Military fanatics gain entrance to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo\nand behead the emperor as the new prime minister plots the takeover\nof the Siberian oil fields. Japanese air force pilot Jiro Kimura\ngets word to U.S. Col. Bob Cassidy, his best friend at the U.S. Air\nForce Academy, that Japan will invade Siberia in two weeks.\n\n   Cassidy's superiors order him back to Washington and tell him\nthat the United Stats has signed a secret protocol to aid Russia in\nany military conflict. As the Japanese invasion begins, Cassidy is\nasked to resign his commission and form a unit of at least 12\npilots to fly F-22s over Russia and shoot down Japanese planes.\nCassidy agrees, but fears that he will have to fight Kimura before\nthe war is over.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Capt. Pavel Saratov uses his very old diesel\nsub to fight two incredible missions against the Japanese. These\nscenes are as vivid as any submarine battles that you've seen in\nthe movies.\n\n   Coonts creates very human, yet extraordinary, characters and\nputs them in perilous situations. The dialogue is real, the battle\nscenes are terrific. ``Fortunes of War'' is a fast-paced and\nbelievable thriller from one of the masters of the genre.\n\n     _____     \n\n   ``Term Limits.'' By Vince Flynn. Pocket Books. $23. 403 pages.\n\n   Two years ago, after the New York publishing world rejected his\npolitical thriller, Flynn returned home to St. Paul, Minn., got\nhelp from three local investors and published ``Term Limits.''\nAfter it became a bestseller in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Pocket Books\npicked up the very readable debut.\n\n   The night before Congress is scheduled to vote on the\npresident's budget, three very powerful and very corrupt\ncongressmen are murdered. Special FBI Agent Skip McMahon is put in\ncharge of the investigation and immediately concludes that the\nkillers are highly trained professionals, probably former U.S.\ncommandos.\n\n   The networks get a letter from the killers demanding that the\npresident withdraw his budget and draw up a ``balanced budget using\nzero-based budgeting. This budget will contain no new or raised\ntaxes and will cut all unneeded federal programs. ... This is the\nonly warning we will give. If you do not respond to these demands,\nyou will be killed. None of you is out of reach _ not even the\npresident.''\n\n   Freshman Rep. Michael O'Rourke thinks the killers did the nation\na favor, but when his mentor, Sen. Erik Olson, is killed by a car\nbomb, O'Rourke is determined to find the killers, fearing he may\nknow who they are.\n\n   ``Term Limits'' really works _ good characters, an interesting\nplot, decent dialogue and good understanding of Washington. A fine\ndebut.\n\n     _____     \n\n   ``Balance of Power.'' James W. Huston. William Morrow and Co.\n$25. 416 pages.\n\n   Huston's geopolitical thriller debut is a winner.\n\n   Armed pirates hijack the world's newest and fastest cargo ship _\nthe Pacific Flyer out of San Diego _ at the port of Jakarta and\nforce the captain to leave port. One of the crew manages to send a\nSOS radio message before he is executed.\n\n   The pirates kill all the crew but the captain, booby-trap the\nship and flee in three cigarette boats. A Navy Seal team parachutes\naboard the ship, finds the victims and the bombs and all but one\nSeal manages to escape before the ship blows up.\n\n   After the pirates demand that the United States remove its\nmilitary presence from the South Pacific and threaten to blow up\nmore ships, the president refuses to order a military assault\nagainst them. Convinced the president is a pacifist, the Speaker of\nthe House asks both houses of Congress to vote on a Letter of\nMarquis and Reprisal, a constitutional means enabling Congress to\ndirect the military to attack the pirates once the Seals discover\ntheir whereabouts on a remote Indonesian island.\n\n   Obviously, a constitutional crisis breaks out in Washington and\nthe White House starts the legal process to have the Letter of\nReprisal declared unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the commander of the\nU.S. fleet nearest Indonesia must decide whether to obey the\npresident or the Letter of Reprisal.\n\n   ``Balance of Power'' ably balances the legal and military\nbattles. The plot is not very believable, but this thriller is\nstill a fun read, with interesting characters.\n","Headline":"\nGRAFTON'S `N' FALLS SHORT OF BEING LETTER PERFECT \n","Text":["\n   ``N Is for Noose.''
