Times News Service    \n\n   It's usually the big, tricked-out Superboats with their\nchurning, 1,000-horsepower engines that draw crowds at offshore\npowerboat races. Now, less-imposing production boats are beginning\nto draw crowds of their own. Their footsteps lead directly to the\namateur boater's door.\n\n   Jim York knows the path. Having recently bought a new 38-foot\nCigarette racer, York plans to compete May 16 in the U.S. Grand\nPrix at Point Pleasant, N.J. His boat has two factory-sealed\nengines, each 500-horsepower, which can produce speeds of 80 miles\nan hour or more.\n\n   Having his own race boat is a new experience for York, the owner\nof a construction firm from Richmond, Va.. His previous powerboat\nwas a recreational craft, albeit a high-performance Cigarette model\ncalled Top Gun. But he raced it only occasionally, mostly in\namateur meets around home.\n\n   With his new boat, which York has named Cigarette Havoline, he\nis competing at the highest level of powerboat racing. That\nincludes the seven-event Super Boat International circuit and other\ncompetitions, such as those sponsored by U.S. Offshore and the\nAmerican Power Boat Association.\n\n   ``These are boats you can actually race, and still use with your\nfamily on weekends,'' York said. ``Before these factory boats were\nbuilt, you had to race in 30-foot custom boats with engines that\nhad to be pulled after every race. That got expensive.''\n\n   New rules set up about two years ago by race planners and\nMercury executives make for a more level playing field. By agreeing\nto develop two classes of production race boats _ Factory I and II\n_ the industry hopes to sell more boats.\n\n   The new factory boats all have the same Mercury engines, which\ncannot be modified regardless of who makes the boat. And the hulls\nmust be vee-shaped rather than designed with a two-hulled catamaran\nconfiguration.\n\n   So far, the idea seems to be working. ``The intent is to bring\nthe average guy into racing, and not have to spend a lot more money\nonce he's in it,'' Donny Wadeck, project manager for high\nperformance boats at Wellcraft, said recently. ``He can use the F-I\nor F-II for a recreation if he doesn't want to race.''\n\n   Either way, the boats' price requires a commitment. A new F-II\nracer from Cigarette costs about $250,000; a comparable Top Gun\nrecreational powerboat costs about $280,000, said Tom Kosto, vice\npresident of sales at Cigarette. The racing version weighs about\n800 pounds less than the 9,000-pound pleasure-boating model.\n\n   ``These boats are giving people something to do other than being\nby themselves out on the water,'' Kosto added.\n\n   John Carbonell, president of Super Boat International, agreed\nthat the factory models seem to be catching on. Race organizers are\npreparing themselves by making rules for boaters who may not have\nadequate experience in racing such fast boats.\n\n   ``A new racer has to stay at the back of the pack,'' Carbonell\nsaid. ``The boat has to be 100 to 200 feet behind the other boats.\nAnd the team has to have the same physicals and safety checks\nbefore the start of a race as the bigger boats. They can still get\ninto trouble, but it's not the same as doing 120 miles an hour.''\n\n   As part of the purchase price, Cigarette includes race uniforms,\nlife jackets and helmets equipped with an onboard intercom system.\nThe company will also furnish a qualified racing partner if the new\nowner requests it. Beyond that, Cigarette pays buyers $500 as a\nstarter bonus for racing, and $500 for winning.\n\n   Cigarette moved into the limelight early with its new race boats\nby winning the Factory II world championship last autumn in Key\nWest, Fla. But other manufacturers, such as Wellcraft, Fountain,\nApache and Hustler, are also promoting factory boats. Factory I\nboats are smaller than the F-II's and come with one engine instead\nof two.\n\n   It has been almost a decade since Cigarette, once a leader in\npowerboat racing, has fielded a factory team. At Point Pleasant,\ntwo of the company's employees, Jack Cabasso as driver, and Phil\nLipschutz at the throttle, will compete aboard Cigarette Sony Music\nin the Factory II Class. As many as 75 offshore powerboats, from 24\nto 50 feet, are expected at the event, which is scheduled to begin\nat 11:30 a.m. off Point Pleasant Beach.\n\n   The factory boats, which will begin about midday, will run 16\nlaps on a four-mile course; the largest craft, the 40-to-50-foot\nSuperboats, are expected to race 13 laps on a seven-mile course\nbeginning at 1:30 p.m.  \n","Headline":"\nPOWERBOATING: MANUFACTURERS COURT AMATEURS WITH NEW CLASS FOR\nRACING \n","Text":["\n   It's usually the big, tricked-out Superboats with their\nchurning, 1,000-horsepower engines that draw crowds at offshore\npowerboat races.
