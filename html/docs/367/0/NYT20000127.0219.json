Times News Service   \n\n   Pretty as a picture and pious as a sermon, ``Grizzly Falls''\ncombines old-fashioned boys' adventure with a heavy-handed modern\nlecture on parenthood. The film possesses a decent heart but\nsuffers from a simple mind.\n\n   Directed by Stewart Raffill (``Swiss Family Robinson'') and\nwritten by Richard Beattie, this Canadian-British co-production is\nconstructed as a flashback, illustrating a story told around a\nwilderness campfire by Old Harry Bankston (Richard Harris) to his\ntwo grandchildren.\n\n   It is a tale of a self-absorbed parent, Tyrone (Bryan Brown),\nwho learns the meaning of fatherly love only when Harry, as a\nlittle boy (Daniel Clark), is carried off into the Canadian Rockies\nby an enormous female grizzly bear (Ali Oop is its professional\nname) after Tyrone captures her two cubs.\n\n   While Tyrone and his half-Indian friend, the expert tracker and\nwise man Joshua McTavish Standing Bear (Tom Jackson), pursue boy\nand big bear into mountainous, forested terrain cut by rushing\nrivers, the boy learns to subsist on grubs and raw fish and meat as\nhe and the huge, slavering grizzly develop their own affectionate\nchild-parent relationship.\n\n   Not for a moment is there doubt that in the end both parents\nwill be happily reunited with their offspring and that father and\nson will be forever enriched by their experience.\n\n   Mixing Dickensian sentiment with Teddy Roosevelt-era costumes\nand attitudes toward self-reliance and manhood, ``Grizzly Falls''\ntells of Harry's youth in Chicago, where his beloved mother died of\nconsumption while his adventure-loving father was off in the Orient\ncollecting artifacts for a museum.\n\n   Shipped off to a boarding school, the lonely child yearns for\nhis father's return. When that happy day arrives, the man he barely\nknows whisks the boy off to the Far West, where Tyrone is mounting\nan expedition to deal with his own childhood trauma by capturing a\ngrizzly alive.\n\n   As soon as he and Joshua have recruited a crew of ruffians,\nincluding the nasty Genet and his pack of hunting dogs, they're off\nto the wilderness, where instead of teaching a bear a lesson, the\nfather will learn a few.\n\n   `Grizzly Falls' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It\nincludes violence and mild profanity.   \n  \n\n   PRODUCTION NOTES  \n\n   `GRIZZLY FALLS'  \n\n   Directed by Stewart Raffill; written by Richard Beattie, based\non a story by Stuart Margolin; director of photography, Thom Best;\nproduction designer, Tom Carnegie; animal trainer, Ruth LaBarge;\nproduced by Peter R.
