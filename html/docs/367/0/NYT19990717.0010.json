Lichtman,\nchairman of the history department at American University. ``There\nreally are quite sharply chiseled differences between the\nparties.''\n\n   As the candidates campaign for the primaries in early 2000,\nvoters will find there also are differences within the parties\nthemselves.\n\n   Among Republicans, Elizabeth Dole broke ranks early in May by\nendorsing mandatory child-safety locks for handguns. Sen. John\nMcCain, R-Ariz., also favors mandatory locks, but former Vice\nPresident Dan Quayle does not. Neither does Texas Gov. George W.\nBush, the GOP front-runner.\n\n   Instead, Bush ``has supported voluntary efforts of gun\nmanufacturers for child-safety locks,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy\nTucker said. Some gunmakers have voluntarily agreed to\nautomatically sell a safety device with every handgun, but many\nhave not.\n\n   In contrast to his Democratic rivals, Bush has not proposed any\nnew federal gun controls. ``What he wants to focus on is\nprosecuting the criminals who commit the crimes with the guns,''\nTucker said.\n\n   Bush does support instant background checks on gun purchasers at\ngun and ammunition shows, something that already is required of the\nlicensed dealers at those events. The idea behind instant checks is\nto ensure that gun-show customers around the nation are screened\neven if they buy from unlicensed vendors.\n\n   But gun-control advocates say the instant-check proposal falls\nshort because it realistically can take a few days for the FBI to\ndetermine whether buyers have criminal or mental-health records\nthat would disqualify them from buying a gun.\n\n   Arizona is among 14 states in which officials conduct background\nchecks by linking directly to FBI computers. In most other states,\nthe FBI conducts the checks, or the checks are made with a\ncombination of state and FBI resources.\n\n   Democrats, accusing Bush of undue caution, believe they can\ncapitalize on the issue if Bush wins the Republican nomination.\n\n   But Frank Luntz, a well-known Republican pollster based in\nsuburban Washington, disagrees. He said Americans are concerned\nabout school violence, but that they don't believe gun control is\nnecessarily the answer, especially not when presented with other\napproaches.\n\n   ``Yes, they (the Democrats) will score in New York, and they may\nscore in San Francisco. But in the rest of the country, gun control\nis the least-best option for most Americans,'' Luntz said.\n\n   ``If the option is only gun control or nothing, the public will\noverwhelmingly choose gun control. But if this is put in the\ncontext of other components in society _ whether it be Hollywood\nand television, violence in video games, even criminal elements\nsuch as stricter sentencing, tougher laws _ they will choose those\noptions over gun control,'' Luntz said.\n\n   The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former\nNew Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have both called for mandatory\nregistration of handguns and a ban on cheap ``junk guns'' that are\neasy to buy and conceal.\n\n   Their proposals go way too far for GOP candidates. None of the\nRepublicans favors registration of new handguns.\n\n   ``We're absolutely opposed,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman\nfor Quayle. ``The Second Amendment (right to bear arms) clearly and\nunarguably does not permit, in his view, the registration of\nhandguns.''\n\n   The Democrats' aggressive stance represents an historic change.\nFor years, candidates of both parties were afraid of touching the\nissue for fear of alienating either rural, pro-gun voters on one\nside, or urban, gun-control advocates on the other.\n\n   Arizona, in particular, has long been regarded as a strong\ngun-rights state. Most of the state's GOP federal officeholders\nhave sided with gun manufacturers in rejecting most gun-control\nproposals.\n\n   Following an emotional gun-control debate in Congress last\nmonth, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., issued a statement detailing the\ndelicate balancing act that the issue often presents.\n\n   During the debate, Kolbe favored a 24-hour waiting period _ but\nno longer _ to conduct background checks on gun-show purchasers.\n\n   ``I believe in the civilian's right to bear arms and I believe\nin a legitimate government role in assuring public safety,'' Kolbe\nsaid. ``These are not mutually exclusive. They appear to clash and\nconflict, but they also converge. I have been both enthused and\nexasperated at trying, with others, to create the proper\nequilibrium.''\n\n   This year, Democrats are gambling that the string of school\nshootings _ from West Paducah, Ken., to Littleton, Colo. _ has\naltered the political climate.\n\n   In particular, the April rampage by two Columbine High School\nstudents in Littleton that left 13 innocent victims dead has helped\nmake the issue more politically potent, especially among women\nvoters.\n\n   Providing the issue with a face, more than 80 high school\nstudents from Littleton and the Denver area appeared Thursday with\nPresident Clinton to endorse gun-law reforms, including\nchild-safety locks and gun-show background checks.\n\n   ``We're a diverse group who do not agree on everything, but we\ndo agree that our gun laws are not working and must be changed,''\nsaid David Winkler, a recent graduate of a Denver high school.\n``While Columbine was overwhelming, tragedies of a smaller scale\ntake place every day.''\n\n   Bradley, the underdog for the Democratic nomination, believes\nthere now is ``an opportunity to do something the public wants and\nreally needs leadership on,'' said Eric Hauser, his spokesman.\n\n   ``The attitudes on gun control, whether you're looking at\npolling or anecdotes, show that there is a yearning to reduce gun\nviolence,'' Hauser said.\n\n   Political scientists say the school shootings have accelerated\nthe gun-control debate. If there is indeed a window for gun\ncontrol, the academicians don't know how long it will last.\n\n   ``I don't think the country has ever seen anything in its entire\nhistory like this rash of school shootings,'' American University's\nLichtman said. ``And the American public does tend to be aroused by\nthe spectacular, flashy or, in this case, horribly tragic events.\nThey give prominence to issues that were not nearly as prominent\nprior to that.''\n\n   But Jack Nagel, a University of Pennsylvania political\nscientist, said the election year is still months away _ quite a\nlong time in politics for an issue to endure.\n\n   ``I think it depends mainly on what else competes with it (gun\ncontrol),'' Nagel said.\n\n   ``Gun control seems to be analogous to abortion in that it's\nsomething that a minority of people feel passionate about.
