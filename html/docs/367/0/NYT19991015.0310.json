Treasure Hunt for Pirated Software Flops        By Benny Evangelista \n       c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  \n\n   \nMicrosoft Corp. attorney Anne Murphy was hoping people who were\nusing pirated software would drop on by Justin Herman Plaza to turn\nin their illegal booty.\n\n   But to perhaps nobody's surprise but her own, yesterday's mildly\npublicized ``Ask If It Is Licensed'' event did not draw one single\nrepentant soul.\n\n   There were plenty of folks who came for the free T-shirts and\nfree software. And at least one man was more concerned about a\ndifferent sort of intergalactic fraud.\n\n   Maybe Microsoft should have called the event ``Ask, But Don't\nTell.''\n\n   ``We're disappointed,'' said Murphy, the chief anti-piracy\nenforcement official for the Redmond, Wash., software colossus. She\nsaid a similar event in San Diego drew about 40 computer sellers\nwho wanted to see if their software was legit, and ``the vast\nmajority was counterfeit.''\n\n   Microsoft and publishing software-maker Adobe Systems of San\nJose sponsored the event to publicize how consumers can tell if\ntheir software was illegally copied and to evangelize about the\nevils of piracy.\n\n   The companies weren't there to throw violators in the slammer\nbut would have exchanged genuine software for illegal copies. Then\nthe illegal programs would serve as evidence to hunt down the real\nperpetrators _ the people who actually copied and sold the\nsoftware.\n\n   Piracy cost the California economy an estimated 18,000 jobs and\n$244 million in lost tax revenue in 1998. The estimated rate of\nillegal software installed statewide last year was about 29\npercent, about eight percentage points higher than in 1997.\n\n   Software piracy includes both individuals and companies that\nmake and distribute illegal copies of legal software and criminals\nwho make and sell counterfeit software.\n\n   In a separate ceremony in Palo Alto, Gov. Gray Davis signed an\nexecutive order setting government policy for state agencies to use\nonly legal copies of software. President Clinton signed a similar\norder covering federal agencies a year ago.\n\n   Yesterday, Microsoft also filed federal suits against four\nNorthern California computer sellers, including one in Fremont.\nMicrosoft has filed more than 160 similar suits nationwide in the\npast year.\n\n   The people who drifted by during the four-hour event mostly\nappeared to be workers enjoying the midday sun rather than software\ndesperadoes.\n\n   Passers-by interviewed agreed that using illegal software was\nbad, although none said they would actually walk up to Microsoft\nadmitting their deed if they were. A few ranked shoplifting a candy\nbar as a worse crime.\n\n   One 29-year-old accountant from Dublin happily admitted sharing\nhis copy of Chessmaster 3000 with 10 friends.\n\n   ``I bought it, and I can give it to my friends if I want,'' said\nthe man, who didn't want to give out his name for fear Microsoft\nenforcers ``would get bored one day and send their legal team after\nme.''\n\n   Frank Chu, 39, of Oakland didn't care about software at all. He\nwas trying to get in front of television cameras with a sign that\nread, ``Impeach Clinton. 12 Galaxies Guiltied (sic)    to A\nTechtronic Rocket Society.''\n\n   ``Clinton has freely committed treason against 12 galaxies,''\nChu explained.\n\n   Murphy hoped no one would take the free software given to a\nselect few in the crowd and make copies.\n\n   ``For someone to learn about piracy and then go out and\nnegatively impact the California economy would be a little bit\ncheeky,'' Murphy said.\n\n   Australian tourist Quentin Chester said software piracy wasn't\nhigh on his list of concerns.\n\n   ``In Australia, we don't tend to be fussed about this stuff,''\nsaid Chester, 41. ``Australians are pretty laid back.''\n\n     \n   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)      \n  \n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   But to perhaps nobody's surprise but her own, yesterday's mildly\npublicized ``Ask If It Is Licensed'' event did not draw one single\nrepentant soul.\n","\n   There were plenty of folks who came for the free T-shirts and\nfree software.
