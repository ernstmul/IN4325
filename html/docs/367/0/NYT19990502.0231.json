(mk) \n By DAVID FIRESTONE   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Returning to the bottom of the serene lake\nwhere a tourist boat slipped below the surface on Saturday, a team\nof divers found a 13th victim Sunday but failed to shed light on\nwhat caused the boat to sink so swiftly.\n\n   The latest victim was identified by local authorities as Jim\nPatton, 48, of Russellville, Ark., who had been missed by divers\nwhen they recovered the bodies of the other victims on Saturday\nafternoon. Sheriff Larry Selig of Garland County said the man's\n15-year-old son, James Jr., who survived the accident, realized on\nSaturday night that his father was not accounted for. Divers found\nthe body about 30 yards from the sunken boat.\n\n   A few hours earlier, Patton's wife, Floy, had died after\nspending the night on life support, the sheriff said. The couple's\ndaughter, Jennifer, 20, also died on the boat.\n\n   Other victims included a brother and sister, both under 5 years\nold, and their father, all from Keithville, La.; and a 3-year-old\nboy and his mother from Dyersburg, Tenn. Many of the victims were\ntrapped under a canopy when the amphibious boat began taking on\nwater several minutes into the aquatic leg of its journey.\n\n   The accident seemed to startle but not benumb this leisurely\ntourist region an hour southwest of Little Rock. Pleasure craft\nsped blithely around a small buoy marking the site Sunday\nafternoon, 300 feet from the shore of Lake Hamilton, and fishermen\nreturned to the surrounding docks.\n\n   Investigators had a few theories Sunday for how the boat could\nhave taken on water, but said they would have no definite answers\nuntil after the boat could be raised, possibly on Monday. The\nvessel, which had passed Coast Guard inspection on Feb. 23,\nofficials said, is submerged in 51 feet of water. Its owner, Land\nand Lake Tours, is to return it to the surface using flotation\ndevices.\n\n   Though most of the victims were from out of town, the sinking\nstruck at the heart of the city's major industry. For four decades\nthe ungainly amphibious vehicles known as ``ducks'' have been a\nfamiliar if curious sight around town, picking up passengers in\ndowntown Hot Springs, rolling on rubber tires down Highway 7 to\nLake Hamilton, and then slicing into the water for a $9 sightseeing\ntour of the man-made lake and the old resort area.\n\n   ``Is this where that duck went down?'' asked Webb Crouse, a\nlocal fisherman who, like many residents, stopped by the lakeshore\nSunday, searching the calm waters in vain for the site of the\naccident. ``It just doesn't make sense that one of those big old\nthings would just disappear.''\n\n   Strange as they looked, the fleet of World War II surplus army\nvessels had an exemplary safety record, never before suffering a\nfatality. With their yellow and white hulls and candy-striped\ncanopies, the boats are a popular staple of the local tourist\nindustry.\n\n   ``A ride on the amphibious duck is an unforgettable\nexperience,'' promises brochures that were still prominently\ndisplayed Sunday in every hotel lobby. A cartoon-like map showed a\ndrawing of a boat making a big splash in precisely the spot of the\naccident.\n\n   Investigators from the Coast Guard and the National\nTransportation Safety Board stood scratching their heads at the\nshore like everyone else, baffled at the sinking. Many of the eight\nsurvivors had said on Saturday that the boat took only 30 seconds\nto go down in sunny, windy weather after taking on water in the\nstern, descending to the bottom stern-first. But no one reported\nhow the water had entered the hull, made of quarter-inch steel and\nbuilt to handle 5,000 pounds.\n\n   Lt. Robert Bowen, chief of the Coast Guard's merchant vessel\nsafety division, said it was conceivable that water had come in\naround the propeller or rudder shafts. Or the hull could have\nsuffered some kind of structural failure. But he said the boat had\neasily passed its inspection in February, just as have all the\nother ducks in the fleet.\n\n   A member of the transportation safety board, John Hammerschmidt,\nsaid Sunday that investigators had interviewed the operator of the\nboat, Beth Hambrick, who told them that she had recently taken it\nin for a repair to the rubber boot that surrounds the drive shaft\nand prevents water from leaking in. The boot had been leaking, she\ntold board investigators, but had been repaired; Saturday's voyage\nwas the first since the boat returned from the repair shop.\n\n   The Coast Guard ordered that the dozen or so ducks operated by\ntwo companies on Lake Hamilton cease operation until the cause of\nSaturday's accident is determined, Bowen said. The Coast Guard is\nweighing whether to impose a similar order on other amphibious\nboats that operate elsewhere in the country, including Branson,\nMo., Galveston, Texas, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The 31-foot\nboats, each weighing 7.5 tons, are part of a group of 21,000 built\nby General Motors in 1943 as landing craft for allied troops\ninvading Europe.\n\n   A lawyer for Land and Lake, Q. Bryum Hurst Jr., said on Saturday\nthat Ms. Hambrick, the boat's operator, had all the credentials\nrequired by the Coast Guard to be captain of the vessel.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The boat went down so suddenly that there was little for\nsurvivors and witnesses to describe.\n\n   ``You can't believe how fast that thing sank,'' said Gary Ledin,\na survivor from Oakdale, Calif., who told The Hot Springs\nSentinel-Record on Saturday that he and his wife had less than 30\nseconds to swim away from the boat and up to the surface. His wife,\nDiane, managed to push her way through one of the windows, but many\nother passengers were trapped beneath the red-and-white canopy.\nBowen said nine of the 13 victims were found beneath the canopy on\nthe boat; the survivors seemed to have been sitting in front of and\nbehind the canopy.\n\n   Although there were 38 life jackets on the boat, which seats 30,\nnone of the 21 people on board _ including the five children under\n15 who died _ was wearing one. Federal and state laws require that\nthe jackets be on the boat, but not that passengers wear them.\nArkansas law requires children under 12 to wear a life jacket on\nrecreational vessels, but the sheriff said it was not clear whether\nthe law applied to a commercial boat operating on a waterway under\nCoast Guard jurisdiction, like Lake Hamilton.\n\n   Selig added that even if everyone had worn a jacket, it would\nnot necessarily have saved any lives. By making each person\nbulkier, the jackets might have prevented people from escaping the\ncanopy and swimming away from the sinking boat, he said.\n\n   Many of the survivors were rescued by other boaters and nearby\nresidents, but the job of lifesaving requires training. Danny\nHarris, 16, said he was staying with friends at a nearby\ncondominium complex when he heard people screaming in the lake.\n\n   ``We all ran down there,'' he said. ``I jumped in the water,\ngrabbed one of the guys who was trying to float, but he was\ndrowning me. So I had to swim back.'' He did not know if the man\nwhom he tried to rescue was later saved.\n\n   The divers, who included sheriff's employees and local\nenthusiasts, described visibility at the bottom as essentially\nzero, and said they found the bodies mostly by touch, about 40\nminutes after the boat sank. When ambulances ran out of space,\ndivers had to place the bodies on nearby docks, and the sight\nstunned nearby residents.\n\n   ``I had to stop looking after a while,'' said Rhett Smith, a\ncomputer operator living nearby.\n","Headline":"\n13TH VICTIM FOUND IN SINKING OF BOAT IN ARKANSAS \n","Text":["\n   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Returning to the bottom of the serene lake\nwhere a tourist boat slipped below the surface on Saturday, a team\nof divers found a 13th victim Sunday but failed to shed light on\nwhat caused the boat to sink so swiftly.\n","\n   The latest victim was identified by local authorities as Jim\nPatton, 48, of Russellville, Ark., who had been missed by divers\nwhen they recovered the bodies of the other victims on Saturday\nafternoon.
