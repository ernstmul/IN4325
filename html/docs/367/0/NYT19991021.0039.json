From her perch at\nthe boat house at Lake Havasu Landing Resort, which she manages,\nWetmore has just about seen it all.\n\n   ``A few years ago,'' she said, ``a man was yelling at his wife\nat the boat launch. He was having trouble launching his boat and he\nwas taking it out on her.''\n\n   Finally, said Wetmore, he barked at her to get in the car and\npark it and the trailer.\n\n   She got in the car all right, and drove it straight back to Los\nAngeles.\n\n   ``I have no idea how he or the boat got home. I guess he had\nfriends,'' said Wetmore.\n\n   While most boat-ramp dramas are less melodramatic, the ramps on\nany given weekend at local lakes, places like Castaic, Pyramid,\nCasitas and Piru, can look like the 101-405 transition at rush\nhour, but they don't have to. Most boat-ramp bottlenecks, say\nmarina managers, are caused by avoidable delays. A few skills, some\ncommon sense and a little etiquette and your trailer rig won't be\nsomeone else's ball and chain.\n\n   Lake Perris, near Riverside, with its steeper ramps sees its\nshare of problems.\n\n   ``Five times this summer big RVs have gone out to the ramps,\nbacked their boats up and the entire RV and boat have gone in,''\nsaid Nick Cuda, store manager at Lake Perris and unofficial\nchronicler of trailering tales.\n\n   ``The RVs are so heavy and the ramp is so steep that the tires\nlock and the RVs go under. They need to be towed out and usually\nsustain flooding damage and water in the gas tank, and that's just\nthe RV. There is usually damage to the boat as well.''\n\n   The most common boat ramp problems can be classified as\nfollowed: Inexperienced boaters who haven't learned to properly\nback a boat up to a boat launch, and disorganized boaters, who\nwaste !ital!your time loading supplies, fiddling with motors, drain\nplugs, Porta Potties and anything else they can think of at the\nlaunch ramp instead of in the parking lot or at home.\n\n   ``One of the things I see happen,'' said Gordon Dumbeck, a sales\nassociate at Newport Boats Sea Ray in Oxnard, ``is people putting\ntheir boats in the water after forgetting to put their drain plugs\nin.''\n\n   For the uninitiated, trailerable boats usually have drain plugs\nat the base of their transoms. The plus is removed when the boat is\ntaken out of the water. If the plugs aren't in when the boat is\nlaunched the next time, you have water coming into the cockpit and\ndelays as boaters scramble to get the bow tied to the trailer or\nstand with a finger in the proverbial dike while said boater's wife\nfishes around in the glove compartment.\n\n   ``I tell new boat owners to make a checklist,'' said Dumbeck.\nStage the boat in the parking lot and go through it. Most things\ncan be done !ital!before you put your boat in the water.''\n\n   Dumbeck also tells novices trailering to take a morning off\nduring the week, drive to the nearest boat ramp and practice\nbacking the trailer when the place is empty.\n\n   ``If you have a truck or SUV,'' he says, ``lower the tailgate or\nraise the back hatch while you back the trailer in, so you can see\nthings directly. It'll make you less reliant on the mirrors, which\ncan be confusing.''\n\n   And while most damage at boat launches is limited to lost\ntempers and missed fishing opportunities, major expense lurks\naround the corner.\n\n   One recurring problem at Lake Havasu, says Wetmore, is boaters\nwho fail to properly secure the boat trailer to the vehicle.\n\n   The boat and the trailer go down into the water without the car.\nSometimes the boat floats the trailer. Sometimes the trailer wants\nto turn turtle. Sometimes everything sinks to the bottom.\n\n   ``The trailer will go down the ramp beautifully,'' said Wetmore.\n``Hopefully someone's around who can help them fish it out and\nsecure it to the vehicle. A lot of people get in a hurry and forget\nthings, and it's not just the beginners.''\n\n   ``I'd say three times a summer, someone will lose their brakes\nand the vehicle, boat and trailer will all go in,'' said Wetmore.\n\n   When an elderly couple, who had never been on the water before,\nuntrailered a boat and proceeded to plow into her gas dock at full\nthrottle, Wetmore decided it was time to start encouraging boaters\nto seek help from more experienced or from workers at the marina.\n\n   ``You have to exercise common sense,'' she says. ``If this means\npracticing backing your boat into your driveway, do it. And it\nnever hurts to ask for help if you lack the skills or knowledge.\n\n   ``Some of the things we see could be on `America's Funniest Home\nVideos.' We have people in the boat house who put chairs out and\njudge boaters on 1-to-10 scale.
