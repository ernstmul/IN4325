Tolkien's ``Hobbit'' and\n``Fellowship of the Ring.'' Also, for the first time a Harry book\nends on a somber note.\n\n   Book 4 doesn't have the emotional resonance of the best parts of\nBook 3, focusing more on adventures than introspection. But it does\nprovide a satisfying depth for several characters in author J.K.\nRowling's carefully imagined world, including new insights into\nProfessor Severus Snape, Hagrid the groundskeeper and even the evil\nLord You-Know-Who.\n\n   And the book keeps up the awesome inventiveness, deadpan humor\nand gripping pace of previous installments, despite a 732-page\ncount that gives ``Goblet of Fire'' the heft of a decent\ndictionary.\n\n   (Warning, Warning, Warning: Potter fans may want to stop reading\nhere, unless they want to know details in the plot the book's\npublisher has guarded as zealously as an Azbakan prisoner.)\n\n   Refreshingly, Rowling tinkers some with the series formula. For\ninstance, she starts with a chapter featuring the evil Lord\nVoldemort rather than hero Harry, and dominates Harry's year at the\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with a ``Triwizard\nTournament'' of challenges rather than the magical game Quidditch.\n\n   Still, there's tradition to spare.\n\n   The Sorting Hat is back, with a newly written song to boot.\n(``It's got to be a pretty boring life, hasn't it, being a hat?''\ncomments Harry's friend Ron Weasley. ``I suppose it spends all year\nmaking up the next one.'')\n\n   Wronged outcast Sirius Black, eating rats for sustenance, keeps\na godfatherly eye on Harry's welfare. Quidditch is still Harry's\nfavorite game, with the book's first chunk dedicated to the\nQuidditch World Cup (Ireland vs. Bulgaria), with a dark faction of\nfans rioting in a scary rally against Muggles (non-magical people).\n\n   As usual, Rowling flawlessly knits her plotlines together, with\nseemingly casual early details taking on meaningful force by the\nend. (Ever wonder why Hogwarts student Neville Longbottom lives\nwith his grandmother? It turns out to matter.)\n\n   And as usual, Rowling slips in sly jokes that keep adults\nentertained too (``Moi?'' says a hefty woman accused of giantess\nblood. ``I 'ave big bones!'')\n\n   The book focuses less on the funny-to-fascinating details of\nlife at a magical boarding school, with more attention on the\ncoming showdown _ it's a seven-book series _ between the good\nwizards on Harry's side and the Death Eater followers of evil.\n\n   One of the most-hyped aspects of the book pre-publication _ that\nHarry and his friends would discover the opposite sex _ is fun but\nnot earthshaking. The romances, such as they are, are old-fashioned\nfor the real 14-year-old set, with on-target agonies about whom to\ninvite to the Yule Ball and a light-handed lecture against favoring\nbeauty over brains.\n\n   The book doesn't hit every note perfectly, though.\n\n   The previous timeless atmosphere is jarred a bit with mentions\nof Playstations and Aqualungs.\n\n   And there's a subplot with the characters called house elves _\nwhose dialect will grit the teeth of anyone who hated Jar Jar Binks\nof ``Star Wars'' notoriety _ creating a parallel between the elves'\nlives and slavery, which hovers uncomfortably between seriousness\nand humor.\n\n   The book's scarier sections are certain to re-ignite a debate\nover whether younger children should read the book, technically\naimed at ages 9 to 12.\n\n   A beloved character faces brief torture; another character (as\nRowling forewarned) is killed; there's one scene with a chopped-off\nhand and another with magical curses that could easily raise the\nhackles of protective parents. (``Abracadabra!,'' for instance,\nwill never have the same ring, now that Rowling has co-opted it as\nthe fatal ``Avada Kedavra'' spell.)\n\n   But the book is unquestionably aimed at children, regardless of\nits older fans, and adults often forget the horrors in older\nchildren's classics that go over young readers' heads.
