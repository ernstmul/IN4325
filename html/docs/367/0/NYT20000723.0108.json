Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ After many years of being outspent and outmuscled\nby the National Rifle Association, the gun-control movement has\nbegun the most ambitious campaign in its history to raise money,\nrecruit foot soldiers and build public support for stronger gun\nlaws in preparation for this fall's national elections.\n\n   From established groups like Handgun Control Inc. to fledgling\nones like the Million Mom March, more gun-control organizations\nthan ever before are doing the kind of grass-roots organizing that\nhas made the NRA so powerful: opening offices across the nation,\ntraining campaign volunteers, devising media campaigns and building\npolitical war chests.\n\n   At the same time, wealthy proponents of gun control seem more\nwilling than in the past to contribute to the cause. Several major\nphilanthropists, including George Soros, have given millions of\ndollars over the last two years to groups that are providing\nintellectual and strategic support to the organizations and\npoliticians who advocate more regulation of guns.\n\n   And in just the last few weeks, a handful of anonymous donors\nhave given more than $2 million to two new groups that will use the\nmoney to help candidates who support gun control and attack those\nwho do not.\n\n   Though the gun-control groups will probably still be outspent by\nthe NRA by at least two to one, their voices in this election are\nlikely to be louder than ever before, through television\ncommercials, mailings and news conferences.\n\n   ``It's not lonely out there anymore,'' said Joe Sudbay,\npolitical director of Handgun Control, which for years was the only\ngun-control group active in elections. ``There is a burgeoning\nsense that the elections are all-important this year.''\n\n   Fueling this burst of organizing is a new-found confidence among\ngun-control leaders that public support for regulating firearms is\nas high as it has ever been. Outrage over mass shootings combined\nwith enthusiasm about the Million Mom March last May has helped\nchange the political climate, they say. And the NRA has lost clout,\nthey contend, as evidenced by the defeat of a referendum to allow\npeople to carry concealed weapons in Missouri last year.\n\n   ``In the 22 years I've been working on this issue, I have never\nseen the climate as favorable'' for gun control, said Peter Hart, a\nDemocratic pollster who works with Handgun Control.\n\n   Hart cites polls showing that the electorate's support for gun\ncontrol _ always high _ is now also more intense, meaning that more\nvoters are making it a top priority. ``Education is 1, the economy\nNo. 2,'' he said. ``But then, ahead of foreign policy and ahead of\nabortion, right there with moral issues and taxes, is gun\ncontrol.''\n\n   Still, even the most optimistic of the gun-control leaders\nacknowledge that they cannot match the resources of the\nbattle-hardened NRA, whose leaders have pledged to spend $15\nmillion on state and federal elections this year, nearly twice as\nmuch as in 1996. The group has already raised $8 million this year\nand has more than $5 million on hand.\n\n   Moreover, with its 3.8 million members, three magazines, vast\ne-mail contact list and national network of affiliated groups, the\nNRA is bigger, more experienced and better equipped to mobilize its\ncore supporters than the gun-control forces are.\n\n   ``Our membership is larger,'' said James J. Baker, executive\ndirector of the NRA political wing, the Institute for Legislative\nAction. ``And our reach extends well beyond our members.''\n\n   ``This is a very important election,'' Baker said, ``maybe the\nmost important general election in the 20 years I've been here _\nfor both sides.''\n\n   Indeed, both camps say the sharp differences between the two\nmajor presidential candidates this year are helping to energize\ntheir supporters.\n\n   Vice President Al Gore has called for an array of new\nrestrictions, including the licensing of new handgun buyers and a\nban on certain inexpensive handguns. But Gov. George W. Bush of\nTexas has generally sided with the NRA, signing bills that allow\npeople to carry concealed weapons and prevent municipalities from\nsuing gun makers.\n\n   Much as the NRA has tried to demonize Gore in its fund-raising\nefforts as a threat to Second Amendment rights, Handgun Control has\nsought to cast Bush as a pawn of the NRA who would team up with a\nCongress controlled by Republicans to rescind every major gun law\non the books.\n\n   In a recent fund-raising letter, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of\nHandgun Control, wrote: ``My friend, if you and I truly want a\nsafer America, we cannot allow George W. Bush to be elected\npresident of the United States. A political disaster of that\nmagnitude would mean four long years of being on the defensive.''\n\n   Such appeals seem to be working. Handgun Control has raised\nnearly $1 million in the last year, three times what it spent in\nthe entire 1996 campaign. The group intends to spend at least $4\nmillion on races this year, focusing on about 20 closely contested\ncongressional races where gun control is an issue. In most cases,\nit will be supporting Democrats, said Sudbay, of Handgun Control.\n\n   Among the Republicans that Handgun Control is likely to work\nagainst are Rep. James Rogan of California and Sen. John Ashcroft\nof Missouri. The group has also run ads in several cities\ncriticizing Bush's record on gun control, and plans to buy more air\ntime in closely contested states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and\nMissouri.\n\n   ``In swing areas, our mission is to make sure voters,\nparticularly women voters, understand the Bush record,'' Sudbay\nsaid.\n\n   In past campaigns, Handgun Control largely stood alone in the\nfight against the NRA. But this year it has been joined by at least\ntwo new advocates. One is the Million Mom March, the nonprofit\ngroup behind the Mother's Day rally in Washington. The group\nrecently created a political arm that has raised $1 million from a\nsingle anonymous donor for political work.\n\n   The second new group, the Campaign for a Progressive Future, has\nraised over $1 million, also from anonymous donors, to spend on\ncampaigns this year, said Steve Cobble, one of its founders.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Both groups organized their fund-raising committees under\nSection 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has allowed them to\nhide the identities of their donors. But Congress recently enacted\nnew rules which will require the groups to disclose the names of\nfuture contributors.\n\n   Beyond its fund raising, the Million Mom March has also opened\nmore than 240 chapters in 46 states, and expects to be represented\nin every state by the fall. Those chapters will be able to lobby\nstate legislatures, train volunteers for campaigns and disseminate\n``voters' guides'' evaluating candidates' records on gun control.\n\n   Modeling itself on Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Million\nMom March will try to help its allies, and hurt its opponents, by\nstaging emotional rallies that feature victims of gun violence or\ntheir survivors. The group plans to endorse a presidential\ncandidate _ almost certainly Gore _ and will get involved in state\nand congressional races.\n\n   ``Our goal is always to get people who have personal experiences\ninvolved in trying to change policy, because they are the most\npowerful forces,'' said Andrew McGuire, executive director of the\nMillion Mom March and a former board member of MADD.\n\n   Cobble, a former adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said his\ngroup would focus on a small number of closely contested\ncongressional races where there were stark differences between the\ncandidates on gun issues.\n\n   ``They have a well-defined, well-developed constituency which\nthey have proven they can mobilize,'' Cobble said, referring to the\nNRA. ``The difference this year is, you will see the first\nstirrings of a not-as-well-defined but potentially larger\nconstituency that supports gun control. Whether it plays out by the\nend of the year remains to be seen. But I do think the tide has\nturned.''\n\n   A fourth group, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, is\nconsidering creating a political action committee. But at the very\nleast, the group plans to hire political organizers to help\nmobilize pro-gun-control voters in 10 to 15 closely contested\ncongressional races, said Mark Pertschuk, the organization's\nlegislative director.\n\n   ``There's social change going on with guns that is very similar\nto what happened with tobacco 15 years ago,'' said Pertschuk, who\nformerly worked with an anti-tobacco group called Americans for\nNon-Smokers' Rights. ``There was this gradual but distinct shift\nfrom `You can smoke in my house and tobacco companies are good\ncorporate citizens' to `No smoking here, and the tobacco companies\nare drug pushers.'''\n\n   Soros, the billionaire financier, has led recent efforts by a\nnumber of philanthropists to support nonprofit groups that are\npushing for tighter gun laws. Although many of those groups are not\novertly involved in politics, they are providing the intellectual\ngroundwork for the political activists.\n\n   For instance, the Funders' Collaborative for Gun Violence\nPrevention, a year-old group created with matching $5 million\ndonations from Soros and the Irene Diamond Fund, has helped finance\nlitigation against gun manufacturers, a study of gun-related\ninjuries by the Harvard School of Public Health, and an array of\ngroups that lobby for tougher gun restrictions, including the\nViolence Policy Center in Washington.\n\n   Rebecca Peters, program director for the Funders' Collaborative,\nsaid one of her main goals was to overcome what she considered the\nmistaken, but widespread, perception that there were already many\ntough gun laws on the books.\n\n   ``Policy-makers and the public believe that the law is much\nstricter than it is,'' Peters said. ``We are funding information\nwhich will allow people and policy-makers to understand how\nsparsely regulated this product and this industry are.''\n","Headline":"\nGUN-CONTROL MOVEMENT IS MOBILIZING TO GAIN SUPPORT \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ After many years of being outspent and outmuscled\nby the National Rifle Association, the gun-control movement has\nbegun the most ambitious campaign in its history to raise money,\nrecruit foot soldiers and build public support for stronger gun\nlaws in preparation for this fall's national elections.\n","\n   From established groups like Handgun Control Inc. to fledgling\nones like the Million Mom March, more gun-control organizations\nthan ever before are doing the kind of grass-roots organizing that\nhas made the NRA so powerful: opening offices across the nation,\ntraining campaign volunteers, devising media campaigns and building\npolitical war chests.\n","\n   At the same time, wealthy proponents of gun control seem more\nwilling than in the past to contribute to the cause.
