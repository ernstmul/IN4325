Times News Service   \n\n   Among motor boat enthusiasts, the vintage launch has always been\nthe queen of the waterways. Though its purpose _ to celebrate\nidyllic river life _ may be frivolous, the boat is not a frivolous\nenterprise. It must have beauty, history and fine wood patina, and\nit cannot make waves, so it can be properly admired as it purrs\nalong.\n\n   If this sounds very English, it is.\n\n   The finest old launches will be on display through Sunday in\nEngland at the 150th Henley Royal Regatta, a highlight of the\nBritish summer social calendar. Hundreds of rowing crews from all\nover the world meet to compete on a bucolic reach of the River\nThames at Henley-on-Thames, 30 miles outside of London.\n\n   There, the spectators are as much a part of the show as the\nrowers. The tents are populated with men wearing brightly striped\ncoats or double-breasted blue blazers, cravats, white flannels and\nstraw boaters. The women don huge hats and fashionable summer\ndresses; pants and shorts are outlawed, and skirts must fall below\nthe knee. No mobile telephones are allowed.\n\n   The food is as old-fashioned as the craft. There are cucumber\nsandwiches, strawberries and cream, and lashings of Pimms No. 1\nCup. And there are tables, chairs and silver service. General\nadmission is 10 pounds a day, or about $16.\n\n   ``It's really like a festival,'' said Colin Henwood, co-owner of\nHenwood & Dean, a Henley boatbuilder who also restores old boats.\n``People come along for the sights. It's a social and jolly time.''\n\n   It's also a time to purchase a vintage boat.\n\n   Phillips, for the 14th year, will hold its annual Rivercraft and\nEphemera sale at Henley on July 10, the Saturday after the races.\n\n   ``The regatta is a decorative and joyous occasion, and Phillips\nhas become part of it,'' said Dan Klein, the international\nexecutive director of Phillips. ``Regatta week has enormous charm\nand tradition. It's a celebration of rowing with all the style one\nwould like to see.''\n\n   This year 53 boats are for sale, 12 of which will be afloat.\n\n   ``Boat collectors are like car enthusiasts,'' Klein said. ``The\nboats are something to care for, cherish and love, like vintage\ncars. Even the grandest people like to do a bit of varnishing, and\nthese boats are a 365-day commitment.''\n\n   The auction includes launches, boating trophies, marine\npaintings and old boat models. Classifications vary, but Lionel\nWillis, Phillips' boat specialist, said he considered a boat\n``antique'' if it was 100 years old and ``vintage'' if built before\n1930.\n\n   ``A classic boat doesn't have to be particularly old, but it has\nto have style, finish and be made and used in classic fashion,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Among the 231 lots at Phillips is a boat with a royal\nprovenance: It is a 1950s Albatross aluminum-alloy speedboat once\nowned by Prince Philip, the duke of Edinburgh, who attended the\nHenley Regatta last year. The boat is a 13-foot sports runabout\nwith a Ford inboard engine and was designed as a light, fast boat\nfor water skiing.\n\n   ``They were built when aluminum was a brand-new material, so\nthey were considered novel and sexy,'' Willis said. According to\nPhillips, Brigitte Bardot, Aristotle Onassis and Prince Rainier all\nhad Albatrosses.\n\n   The Albatross in the auction was on the Royal Yacht Britannia\nuntil 1967, when it was transferred to Balmoral in Scotland. It was\nsold to its present owner in the late 1980s.\n\n   ``It comes with instructions from the captain of the\nBritannia,'' Klein said.\n\n   Willis added: ``The Britannia was a Navy ship. Everything had to\nbe done by the book, Navy fashion, including how to come up\nalongside the yacht.''\n\n   The Albatross is estimated to sell for $4,750 to $7,900.\n\n   Vintage racing boats are another favorite collecting category.\n\n   The rarest boat in the sale, Klein said, is Batboat II, a\n21-foot-long hydroplane lake racing boat built in 1912 that is\nnamed for its British designer, Montague Batting.\n\n   ``They didn't build very many of them, and they stopped making\nthem in 1915, so few survive,'' Willis said. Created for the\nBritish International Trophy Races, Batboat II has a mahogany deck\nwith an open cockpit fitted with a mahogany bench seat.\n\n   The boat finished first in the 1913 trials, and was then sent to\nAmerica where, Klein said, ``She was used for rum running on the\nHudson River during Prohibition.''\n\n   Estimate: $9,500 to $14,250.\n\n   The most elegant boat type in the sale is the slipper stern\nlaunch, whose stern angles down to the water.\n\n   ``It tapers off at the back like a sucked toffee,'' Willis said.\n``It was designed by a man who lived on the Thames and wanted a\nboat that had less wash, so he wouldn't swamp the punts and\ncanoes.''\n\n   ``These launches are classics,'' Klein said. ``They were\ndesigned for little afternoon excursions, to see and be seen.''\n\n   Phillips is selling the Mayflower, a slipper stern launch made\nin 1934 that is 30 feet long and fitted with four white Decoesque\nmovable lounge chairs. Willis said the owner was selling it because\nshe now wanted a boat ``with the lid on it,'' meaning a top for\nshade. Estimate: $28,500 to $31,600.\n\n   Americans like classic boats as much as the English do, though\nAmericans divide their loyalties into camps: power and sail; modern\nand traditional, freshwater and salt.\n\n   Bob Gilson of Madison, Wis., has been collecting old Gar Wood,\nChris-Craft and Hacker power boats for 15 years.\n\n   ``I love restoring wooden boats,'' he said. ``I like the smell\nof the wood varnish and figuring out how to maintain the old\nmotors.'' He said he attended a classic boat show in March in Mount\nDora, Fla., and planned to go to another one in Lake Tahoe, Calif.,\nin August.\n\n   ``It's a reason to go somewhere to go boating,'' he said.\n\n   A nationwide speedboat show schedule is printed in Classic\nBoating, a bimonthly published in Oconomowoc, Wis. On the East\nCoast, Wooden Boat magazine of Brooklin, Maine, lists wooden boat\nshows and events all over the world.\n\n   Boat lovers are a congenial lot. Several members of the East End\nClassic Boat Society gathered on Sunday at the main dock of Sag\nHarbor, N.Y., for the annual blessing of the fleet. The wooden\nboats present included a Friendship sloop from Maine, a Beetle\ncatboat, a Monterey Clipper fishing boat from California, a Maine\npeapod (a double-ended rowing skiff), a 12-foot Bahamian sailing\ndinghy and a sailing dory.\n\n   Rob Barker of Easton, Pa., who built the dory for sails and\noars, explained, ``you use the ash breeze when the wind goes\ndown.''\n\n   The boaters were having a grand time trading stories and\ncocktails.
