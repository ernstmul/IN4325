{"DocumentId":"NYT20000822.0083","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"0","Body":" BC-TECH-MOVIES-BOS \nDOWNLOAD WAR, THE SEQUEL: FILM TRADING STIRS NEW FIGHT \n\n   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By PATTI HARTIGAN  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   In the underground world of computer hackers, he goes by the\nname Dvdboy and is renowned for his skill at converting DVDs into a\nformat that allows movies to be shared easily _ and illegally _\nover the Internet. A self-described movie buff who owns more than\n300 DVDs, the 27-year-old network engineer takes great pride in his\nwork. ``For me, the motivation is being considered the best,'' he\nsays.\n\n   Dvdboy, who lives in the United Kingdom and requested that his\nreal name not be used, thinks of himself as an artist. Executives\nin the film industry use another word: pirate.\n\n   Welcome to the latest battleground in the download war that\nbegan with free music and Napster, a conflict that is pitting\nhackers and activists against entertainment industry executives.\nWhile digital piracy is not as rampant with movies as it is with\nmusic, an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 movies are traded every day\non the Internet, from summer releases like ``Me, Myself, and\nIrene'' to cult favorites like ``Star Wars'' and ``The Matrix.''\nAnd the movie industry isn't sitting back quietly. The Motion\nPicture Association of America won round one on Thursday when a\nfederal judge ruled that it is illegal to publish DeCSS, a computer\nprogram used to crack antipiracy features on DVDs.\n\n   But don't be mistaken: The war has only just begun.\n\n   ``Even if they win, they lose,'' says Bruce Forest, director of\nmedia and entertainment for Viant, a New York consulting company.\n``The war is still raging, and the technology cannot be stopped.''\n\n   Indeed, the underground trading of movies is growing rapidly,\nthanks to new technology. First, programmers use DeCSS to decode\nthe encryption used to protect DVDs from piracy. Then, they use a\ncompression program named DivX (which is not related to the defunct\nalternative to DVDs that used the same name). Developed earlier\nthis year by a Jerome Rota, a French videographer, the technology\nenables programmers like Dvdboy to compress huge DVDs into files\nthat are small enough to store on a CD or on a hard drive. With a\nhigh-speed connection, it is now possible to download a full-length\nmovie in one or two hours, a process that would have taken days\nwithout DivX. And the quality is near picture-perfect.\n\n   That's not to say it's easy. Movie trading today is where music\ntrading was a year or so ago: It's a byzantine process that is\nstill largely underground. Most of the action takes place on\nInternet Relay Chat, the system of underground chat channels\ndominated by hacker cliques. Films are also traded on Usenet\nbulletin boards, although they are often divided into many small\nfiles that must be retrieved separately. They are also distributed\non private sites that are restricted to insiders, and some movies\nare traded on networks like Gnutella and Scour Exchange. The\nprocess is hardly as easy as point and click.\n\n   But a little more than a year ago, the only people who regularly\ntraded music online were the true tech heads and code freaks, and\nnow, more than 24 million people are sharing music files on\nNapster, which simplifies the download process. Industry experts\nexpect that movie sharing will become as simple in a matter of\nmonths, cautioning that the movie industry has a very short window\nbefore a movie version of Napster becomes a new household word.\n\n   So far, the movie industry has taken its case directly to the\ncourts, going after individuals and suing such companies as Scour,\na strategy derided by techies. ``In the worst case, you take all of\nthe users who were above ground and you drive them underground,''\nsays Gene Kan, one of the developers of Gnutella, a decentralized\nfile-sharing system developed after Napster was sued. ``They do\nexactly what they were doing before, only now they are forced to\nrealize that there are more deceptive ways of doing what they\nwanted to do anyway.''\n\n   Industry leaders counter that they will use technology to defeat\ntechnology. ``We are determined to put our movies online, but we\nwon't do so until we can dispatch them to homes in a safe and\nsecure environment,'' says Jack Valenti, president of the Motion\nPicture Association.\n\n   The movie industry is attempting to learn from the music\nindustry's less-than-successful attempts to sell digital music\nonline; so far, three of the four major record companies have\nlaunched pilot programs, but they are extremely difficult to use.\n\n   ``When it comes to downloading music, it's easier to be\ndishonest than to be honest,'' says Richard Wolpert, a former\nDisney executive and the head of Chance Investments, a venture\ncapital firm that funds digital entertainment ventures, including\nScour. ``People won't put up with it. The entertainment companies\nhave to come up with a system that is as easy to use as Napster.''\n\n   There are plenty of folks vying to do just that. Rota, 27, has\nteamed with several Internet entrepreneurs to found a company\ncalled ProjectMayo.com; the firm aims to release a simplified\nversion of DivX that can be used for legal purposes such as sharing\nhome videos. The firm is also developing a database that can be\nused for a digital video-on-demand system; it has yet to ink any\ndeals with the studios.\n\n   ``They have about 9 to 12 months to lead the charge,'' says\nJordan Greenhaul, ProjectMayo's CEO. ``After that the\ninfrastructure will change, and it will become a slugfest between\nthe motion picture industry and the underground Internet world.''\n\n   Movies are becoming more popular on the Internet every day. A\n20-year-old Virginia Tech college student who runs\nwww.divxnews.com, a site that distributes news about DivX movies,\nsays that his site receives 40,000 hits a day _ and that number is\nrising.\n\n   Greenhaul goes so far as to say that a little piracy is a good\nthing. Pirates, he says, are ``scum-of-the-earth types (who)\naccelerate the opening up of markets that wouldn't open up without\nthem. Piracy may be a viable force in our social dynamic.''\n\n   Few other entrepreneurs hoping to capitalize on the\ndigital-movie market would go so far as to argue the social value\nof piracy. But some say that piracy will not be such a big issue if\nthe movie industry can get its act together soon. ``There will\nalways be some minimal form of piracy,'' says Howard Weizman, CEO\nof Massive Media Group, a digital rights management company. ``But\nmost consumers aren't comfortable stealing. Once they have a legal\noption for digital entertainment content at a reasonable price,\npiracy will be miniscule.''\n\n   As the clock ticks, the definition of copyright is evolving and\nmores are changing as consumers become accustomed to downloading\nmusic _ and eventually movies _ for free. ``The proliferation of\ninformation increases its value,'' says John Perry Barlow, a\nfounder of the Electronic Freedom Foundation. ``Information isn't\nan industrial product. You can't think of movies as though they\nwere toasters.''\n\n   But so far, the movie industry's definition of copyright has\nprevailed in the courts, and some say they will win the battle for\ncontrol over content. The movie industry will eventually figure out\nhow to turn digital movies into a new revenue stream, the way it\ndid with videocassettes and DVDs. Even Dvdboy, the European\nprogrammer, contends that DivX movies serve as samples that\nincrease the sales of DVDs. ``DivX is not a replacement for the DVD\nitself, as the quality of the video cannot compare to that of my\nhome theater,'' he says.\n\n   Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard's Berkman\nCenter for the Internet and Society, predicts that a new generation\nof Internet appliances will be developed, specifically for the\ndistribution of legal entertainment content. ``The arms race is in\nearnest,'' he says, ``but it is too early to count the giants of\nthe movie industry down and out. You wouldn't like them when they\nare angry, and they are definitely angry at this point.''\n","Headline":"\nDOWNLOAD WAR, THE SEQUEL: FILM TRADING STIRS NEW FIGHT \n","Text":["\n   In the underground world of computer hackers, he goes by the\nname Dvdboy and is renowned for his skill at converting DVDs into a\nformat that allows movies to be shared easily _ and illegally _\nover the Internet.
