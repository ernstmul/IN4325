TWO SIDES LOCKED IN FIERCE FIGHT FOR SWING VOTES ON GUN(nk) \n By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepared for a high-stakes, heavily\nlobbied debate on youth violence and guns, President Clinton and\npro-gun forces vied fiercely Tuesday for the votes of a critical\ngroup of lawmakers from swing districts who could decide the\noutcome of gun control measures.\n\n   With the contentious debate fracturing both parties in the\nHouse, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., was working closely with Rep.\nTom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, on an amendment that would\nwater down a provision passed by the Senate requiring background\nchecks on all buyers at gun shows.\n\n   A confidant Dingell, whose victory would be a blow to the\npresident and the Democratic House leadership, predicted that he\nhad enough votes to prevail when the final gun control votes come\non Thursday. ``We will win,'' Dingell said.\n\n   But the gun control issue has proven remarkably fluid and\nunpredictable this spring, and gun control advocates were not\nconceding the fight.\n\n   Beyond that, DeLay warned that the measure Dingell was\nsponsoring might run into trouble. Republicans allied with DeLay\nsaid they were concerned that conservatives might not rally around\nhim to vote for Dingell's amendment because they oppose any\nrestrictions at all on firearms.\n\n   Even though Speaker Dennis Hastert has said Republican leaders\nwill allow gun control to be a vote of conscience for members,\nDeLay has been instrumental in fashioning the structure of the\nupcoming debate and the various gun control measures coming to the\nfloor.\n\n   He met last week with Dingell and on Monday with aides to some\nRepublican moderates. His allies say DeLay is trying to pass some\nmodest gun control measure to keep Hastert, who virtually promised\nsome gun control, from another embarrassing defeat.\n\n   Indeed, Republicans said party leaders implored them Tuesday\nnight to hold together across the next few days and pass some kind\nof a consensus bill rather than risk looking like a do-nothing\nCongress. Democrats, however, charge DeLay is really trying to doom\nany serious restrictions on firearms.\n\n   The maneuvering was part of an intensifying fight for votes, as\nwell as a public relations drive by both parties seeking to appeal\nto suburban parents stricken by a horrific series of school\nshootings.\n\n   Throughout the day both Clinton and a series of Republicans held\ncompeting news conferences on gun control and Republican efforts to\nregulate violence in entertainment. Both portray them as issues of\nprotecting children.\n\n   Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by\nfemale members of Congress from both parties to rally support for\nan amendment by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would counter\nDingell's measure and is modeled after the Senate legislation on\ngun shows.\n\n   In a pointed appeal to suburban women, Clinton cast gun control\nas a women's issue, saying, ``Women who belong to both parties in\nAmerica, all over this country, have been in the forefront of this\nfight. They care about it as mothers, as sisters, as daughters, as\ncitizens of this country.''\n\n   He also implored lawmakers not to heed the National Rifle\nAssociation. ``Once again the gun lobby is resisting with all its\nmight,'' Clinton said. ``Once again, we're battling not just for\nthe safety of our families but the soundness of our democracy.''\n\n   For their part, Republicans were trying to shift the focus from\ngun control to cultural issues that they said were more responsible\nfor youth violence. Late Monday, in a surprise maneuver, they\ndecided to bring two separate bills to the floor _ one on social\nand entertainment issues and the other simply on gun control.\n\n   Tuesday, they highlighted measures ranging from federal\npermission to post the Ten Commandments in schools to criminal\npenalties for adults who allow children access to entertainment\nthat Republicans described as ``obscenely violent.''\n\n   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., cast youth violence as an issue of\nculture, and said violent material makes it no surprise that\nteen-agers ``plan mass murders instead of graduation parties.''\n\n   But even some Republicans were opposed to some of the directions\ntheir party was taking. ``This is a big government solution to a\nproblem that government can actually do little to solve,'' said\nRep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., at a news conference.\n\n   On the table in front of him were videos that he said minors\nwould be prohibited from watching under a key Republican proposal,\nincluding ``Schindler's List,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Mission\nImpossible'' and ``Home Alone.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Tuesday night, after a closed-door party caucus, Republicans\nwere still trying to decide which of nearly 200 measures relating\nto gun control and youth violence to allow to the floor for a\ndebate expected to last 15 hours over two days.\n\n   Republicans said they were leaning toward allowing about 40\namendments on entertainment, culture and law enforcement _\nincluding one on school prayer and the one allowing the Ten\nCommandments to be posted in schools.\n\n   But it was the gun control measures that were the focus of the\nheaviest pressure.\n\n   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri accused the\nRepublicans of seeking to rig House procedures in their favor.\n``This is not a legislative process,'' he said in a letter to\nHastert, ``it is a deliberate effort to give gun control opponents\nevery advantage while depriving gun control advocates of vital\ninformation.''\n\n   The House is expected to take up several competing versions of\nthe measure on background checks at gun shows. It is also to\nconsider requirements for child safety devices on new handguns, a\nraise in the minimum age for all purchases of handguns to 21 from\n18, a ban on the import of high capacity ammunition clips and new\nrestrictions on the possession of semiautomatic rifles.\n\n   Several versions of each of these provisions have been proposed\nby an array of lawmakers, some stronger than others. As of Tuesday\nnight, Republicans appeared likely to let to the floor a Republican\nversion of the child safety device measure that is less stringent\nthan the Democrats were proposing. But they were looking to allow\nthe Democratic version of the ban on imported ammunition clips to\nthe floor.\n\n   The National Rifle Association had about a dozen lobbyists\nworking Capitol Hill against the stricter gun control alternatives\nwhile Hand Gun Control, a gun control group, had set up phone banks\nto urge gun control advocates to call Congress.
