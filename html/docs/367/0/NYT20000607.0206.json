Parrott\nsays that's the single best technique for dealing with overly\ndriven people.\n\n   ``The risky thing about empathy is it will change you,'' says\nParrott, co-director of the Center for Relationship Development at\nSeattle Pacific University. ``It's threatening, because we don't\nlike to change.''\n\n   But he says it's worth the effort:\n\n   ``The research has shown that 90 percent of the problems we\nencounter in relationships can be resolved, or at least improved,\nby doing nothing other than seeing that issue from the other\nperson's perspective.''\n\n   Parrott delves deeper in his new book, ``The Control Freak:\nCoping With Those Around You, Controlling the One Within'' (Tyndale\nHouse, 193 pages, $19.99).\n\n   Parrott, who writes prolifically on relationship issues, is a\nfamiliar media figure, with past appearances on ``Oprah,'' ``NBC\nNightly News,'' ``CBS This Morning'' and other shows.\n\n   His renown stems from his work with SPU's Center for\nRelationship Development, which he and his wife, Leslie _ a\nmarriage and family therapist _ founded and direct. They also teach\nthe most popular class on the SPU campus, ``Relationships 101.''\n\n   This month the Parrotts begin a year as\n``marriage-scholars-in-residence'' in Oklahoma as part of the\nstate's $10 million campaign to reduce its spiraling divorce rate.\n\n   So just what is a control freak?\n\n   Parrott defines it as ``someone who cares more about something\nthan you do and becomes pushy to get their way.''\n\n   He says their tactics are legion:\n\n   ``They can be obnoxious, they can be persistent, they can be\ninvasive, they can be nit-picky and perfectionist.''\n\n   And modern life is making it worse.\n\n   ``Technology is feeding our control frenzy,'' Parrott maintains.\n``People like to-do lists. These Palm Pilots and everything we use\nnow to get organized make us feel in control.''\n\n   Control freaks victimize themselves as well as others. They risk\nhigh blood pressure, heart disease and, at the very least, loss of\nenjoyment in life.\n\n   ``Psychologically, there's this intense pressure that never\nallows you to relax when you're a control freak,'' Parrott says.\n``You're doing so much at the same time. You're putting on your\nmakeup while you're driving the car. There's no sense of peace or\ncenteredness.''\n\n   Parrott has written about other difficult personality types,\nfrom The Wet Blanket and The Critic to The Flirt. He described 15\nsuch party-poopers in a 1997 book, ``High-Maintenance\nRelationships.''\n\n   But, like the Avon Lady, the control freak pushes a lot of\nbuttons. After Parrott's ``High-Maintenance'' guide was published,\nmany readers sent letters asking him to expand on his chapter about\nThe Control Freak. So he wrote his new book.\n\n   ``Almost anyone you talk to will say, `I know a control freak, I\nam a control freak,' '' says Parrott, 38, a boyish-looking\nprofessor with a shock of brown hair spilling over his forehead.\n\n   He's dressed casually, in navy polo shirt, jeans and mocs\nwithout socks. But he has the tightly coiled manner you'd expect in\na guy who says he has spent his entire married life harping on the\nbackhanded way his wife cuts carrots. To no avail, incidentally.\n\n   ``We've been married 16 years,'' he notes rhetorically, ``and\nhow do you think she cuts carrots?''\n\n   His control-freak symptoms flared recently after a five-hour\nwait at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport made him an hour\nlate for an appearance in Charlotte, N.C. Stressed and anxious, he\nfelt driven to control the entire event, from the scheduling to the\nseating arrangements.\n\n   ``Instead of saying, `What's your opinion?' I began to bark\norders,'' Parrott says.\n\n   Afterward, the host told him, ``You need a vacation. You were\npretty uptight.''\n\n   Nervous, high-strung people are more prone to controlling\nbehavior, but most of us go overboard once in a while. We may be\ntired and stressed _ or reacting to a pet peeve like how to hang\nthe toilet-paper roll.\n\n   Up to a point, a drive for control is healthy and even essential\nfor functioning, Parrott says. The ability to manage pain is one\nexample.\n\n   Even hard-core controllers may have redeeming qualities _\ncompetence and commitment, for example. As Parrott puts it, ``Would\nyou rather go to a surgeon who's happy-go-lucky or a control\nfreak?''\n\n   Parrott says controlling behavior crosses the line ``when it\nstarts to interfere with your functioning, when you become an\nirritant to the people around you.''\n\n   Hard-core types turn every situation into a competition for\ncontrol. Most of them will do ``just about anything'' to get their\nway, making victims feel not just annoyed but demeaned.\n\n   In that case, empathy will get you only so far. If the control\nfreak is interfering with your ability to enjoy life or function\nwell, it's time to draw some boundaries. But try to remain tactful\nand calm. Avoid ultimatums.\n\n   ``Threatening a control freak is not the wisest of things,''\nParrott says, ``because that sends them more wildly out of\ncontrol.''\n\n   Finally, recognize it may not be in your power to fully remove\nthe thorn from your side.\n\n   ``One person can change the dynamics of the relationship,''\nParrott says. ``But for the control freak to change, it really\ncomes down to awareness.''\n","Headline":"\nEMPATHY BEST FOR CONTROLLING CONTROL FREAKS \n","Text":["\n   Pity the poor control freak.\n","\n   Even as he makes your life hell, he's quivering with hidden\nanxiety. ``A jellyfish in armor'' is how one expert describes him.\n","\n   In fact, if you understood what's driving him (or her), you'd\nsympathize _ up to a point.\n","\n   At the very least, maybe the jerk wouldn't get under your skin\nso much, says psychologist Les Parrott III, who wrote the book on\ncontrol freaks and admits to some control tendencies himself.\n","\n   There are ways to neutralize overcontrolling behavior, much of\nwhich stems from a fear of being criticized or shamed for making an\nerror.\n","\n   But for now just start working on that empathy thing.
