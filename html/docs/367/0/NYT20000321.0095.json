It\nwas a debate, in any event, over an abstraction, since the channels\nwere so clogged by pack ice even during summer months as to make\npassage impossible to all but mighty icebreakers and\nspecially-designed research vessels.\n\n   But soon Canada may find itself pitted against not only its\npowerful southern neighbor but also seagoing nations around the\nworld _ including Russia, Japan, and nearly every European country\nwith ocean ports _ over its claim to own the northern waterways.\n\n   It is a conflict that could test the limits of diplomacy. The\ncommander of Canadian forces in the far north said in an interview\nthat he anticipates his country may be required to use firepower to\nenforce its claims.\n\n   ``National security, the safety of native coastal communities,\nand the protection of an extremely vulnerable ecology are at\nstake,'' said Colonel Pierre Leblanc, commander of Canada's\nnorthern military zone, embracing 1.5 million square miles of\nfrozen barrens. ``When it comes to these, Canada can be a very\ntough country. We will defend our interests and our honor, with\nforce, if necessary.''\n\n   Already, there are signs that major sea powers may be quietly\nprobing the seas of the Canadian Arctic.\n\n   Last Aug. 16, Inuit fishermen stared in disbelief as a strange\nand threatening sea beast burst from the frigid waters of\nCumberland Sound, near the hamlet of Pangnirtung. This was no\nwhale.\n\n   First loomed the conning tower and then the riveted steel skin\nof a submarine moving at speed, seven-foot wave curling off the\ndark bow.\n\n   An alert was sent to Canadian Forces northern region\nheadquarters in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. As orders and\nqueries bounced back and forth across the country, a squadron of\nCP-140 Aurora maritime patrol planes lifted from a base in\nGreenwood, Nova Scotia. But by the time the submarine hunters had\nflown the 1,600-mile distance _ and peppered the ice-flecked waves\nwith sonar buoys _ the quarry had vanished to the deep.\n\n   There would be more submarine sightings over the next two weeks,\nbut only by Inuit villagers untrained in vessel identification.\nFrom their descriptions of the warcraft, however, Canadian military\nanalysts suspect the submarine was French or American.\n\n   If the mysterious incursion did not pose a true military threat,\nit did represent a slap at Canadian sovereignty over its vast\nArctic archipelago _ a humilitation that has left the country's\ndownsized military quietly seething.\n\n   Worse may be yet to come. Scientists and military specialists\nwarn that far more direct, even hostile, challenges are likely to\nquestion Canada's claims to control the sea passages between the\nNorth Atlantic and some of Asia's most important ports.\n\n   The ice packs that cover much of the Canadian Arctic are\nreceding and thinning at rates that scientists describe as\nalarming, reflecting a planetwide warming trend.\n\n   The phenomenon has been much ballyhooed by environmentalists,\nsome of whom predict flooding of coastal cities and catastrophic\nchanges in climate. Doomsday scenarios aside, the sea change is\nalso being watched closely by seagoing powers, especially the\nUnited States, as well as by hard-headed international shipping\nexecutives from Tokyo to Rotterdam.\n\n   ``The waters are opening, this is not science fiction,'' said\nAndre Maillet, head of Arctic icebreaking operations for the\nCanadian Coast Guard. ``Whether it's a few years away or a couple\ndecades, the passage is going to become a vital commercial channel.\n\n   ``The shipping companies already have their eye on the route,''\nhe said. ``And they are not going to wait.''\n\n   Indeed, in a bit of nautical history-making that attracted\nalmost no notice, a Russian ocean tug, the Irbis, last fall hauled\na huge floating dry dock through the icy labyrinth _ traveling from\nRussia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula to Freeport, Bahamas _ the\nfirst industrial transit of the Northwest Passage by a non-Canadian\nvessel.\n\n   The name Northwest Passage refers to several possible routes\nthrough the maze of sounds, gulfs, channels, and straits that\ntransect an almost incomprehensibly vast and barely-populated\nregion, and Canada says it is an internal waterway. It says that\nOttawa alone has the authority to regulate shipping and, above all,\nto set the environmental rules for the zone.\n\n   Canada's primary fear is the environmental havoc that would be\ncaused by a ruptured oil tanker or the wreck of an ordinary\ncontainer ship. The few creatures that survive in the frozen\nbarrens are perhaps more susceptible to pollution than in any other\npart of the world because the food chain is so thin.\n\n   But overriding even ecological concerns are worries about\nnational sovereignty and whether Canada can enforce territorial\nclaims to its empire of ice-capped islands. The country is already\nproving rich in oil, gas, diamonds, gold, and other mineral wealth.\n\n   ``The Canadians see the north as part of their heritage,'' said\nChris Sands, a Canadian affairs analyst with the Washington-based\nCenter for Strategic and International Affairs. ``It's an extremely\nsensitive issue.''\n\n   So a country known for its soft voice on defense matters may\nfind itself forced to take a very hard line on the Arctic.\n\n   ``These are Canadian waters,'' said Leblanc, responsible for the\ndefense of a military zone stretching from the Alaska border to the\nDavis Strait off Greenland, but inhabited by only 90,000 people.\n\n   Many seafaring powers, most stridently the United States, take a\nradically different view of the Northwest Passage, claiming that\nthe channels threading through the Canadian Arctic form an\ninternational waterway and must be freely navigable to all\ncommercial ships and naval fleets.\n\n   ``It's our firm position that Canada has no more right to\nrestrict the Northwest Passage than Malaysia has to restrict the\nStrait of Malacca,'' said one senior official in Washington,\nreferring to the heavily-trafficked sea lane between the Indian and\nPacific oceans. ``These are world waters.''\n\n   To make its point, the United States has twice in recent decades\nenraged Canada by sending ships through the ice without permission\n_ the experimental heavy-hulled oil tanker Manhattan in 1969 and\nthe icebreaker Polar Sea in 1985.\n\n   Despite the fury provoked in Ottawa, the American voyages were\nbasically symbolic exercises, since only specially-designed ships\ncould make the treacherous transit from the North Atlantic to the\nBeaufort Sea.\n\n   But now many analysts predict that within a decade or so, the\nice floes will thin or recede so much for at least six months of\nthe year that the fabled passage will be navigable by container\nvessels, tankers, and luxury cruise ships with only modestly\nreinforced hulls.\n\n   ``It's a significant shortcut from Europe to Japan and other\nparts of Asia,'' said Sands. ``For the US, it would make shipping\nof crude oil from Alaska to Boston, or anywhere on the eastern\nseaboard, economically feasible for the first time.''\n\n   Most keen on the route are owners of ships plying between\nWestern Europe and Japan, South Korea, Siberia, and northeastern\nChina. To make that journey via the Panama Canal, vessels must\ntravel 12,600 nautical miles. The best route through the Canadian\nArctic, by contrast, would cover a bit less than 8,000 nautical\nmiles, which would mean savings in fuel, time, and crew salaries.\n\n   Moreover, the Arctic channels are opening at a time when\nshipping companies are fretting about possible political\ninstablity, corruption, and technical breakdowns in Panama, now\nthat the United States has relinquished control over the historic\ncanal, which may prove too narrow to handle the next generation of\nsupertankers and mammoth container ships.\n\n   Opening the passage would be the fruition of a goal sought for\ncenturies by European explorers seeking a shorter sea route to the\nthe Far East. In 1576, Martin Frobisher made it to the tip of\nBaffin Island, in present-day Nunavut. Henry Hudson combed the\ngreat bay that bears his name in 1610 but was thwarted in his dream\nof discovering a new way to China. John Franklin and his crew died\nafter resorting to cannibalism when his two ships were trapped in\nice 1847.\n\n   Finally, in 1905, a plucky Norwegian, Roald Amundsen, completed\na two-year voyage in a refitted herring boat to become the first to\nsuccessfully navigate the entire Northwest Passage. Like the moon\nlanding later in the century, however, Amundsen's journey was an\nepic achievement with no real practical significance. Until very\nrecently, the route he charted remained dangerous and essentially\noff-limits to all except adventurers, scientific researchers, and\nflag-waving exercises, such as those mounted by the United States.\n\n   But now, Alaska-based cruise ships are starting to ply sections\nof the passage, sometimes asking Canadian permission _ sometimes\nnot. In a weird episode last summer, a Chinese government vessel\nlanded at the tiny fishing port of Tuktoyaktuk without notice. A\nfew crew members disembarked, wandering about and snapping photos\nuntil the local constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\nstarted asking questions. The Chinese then reboarded and steamed\naway.\n\n   Yet for all Canada's tough talk about defending Arctic sea\nroutes and national sovereignty, the country has only a token\nmilitary presence in the far north: 200 soldiers, sailors, and\naviators belonging to the regular military, plus 1,500 Indian and\nInuit belonging to irregular Ranger units.\n\n   ``The military sees the dangers _ environmental, national\nsecurity and the prospect of new smuggling routes _ and is trying\nhard to think of ways to deal with the issues before the passage\nbecomes trafficked, (and) it's too late,'' said Huebert, the\nUniversity of Calgary political scientist.\n\n   ``But in Canada, the military doesn't set national priorities,''\nhe said. ``And the politicians who do just aren't thinking about\nthis. The far north is too far away, even to Canadians.''\n","Headline":"\nWITH ICE THINNING, CANADA CLAIMS THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE \n","Text":["\n   CAMBRIDGE BAY, Nunavut Territory _ The ice packs that block\nnavigation across the top of the world are thinning as Earth's\nclimate warms, raising the likelihood that commercial shipping and\nmilitary vessels will soon routinely ply these long-frozen seaways.\n","\n   The rapid retreat of the ice is also opening the way to direct\nchallenges to Canada's control over the waters of its vast northern\nrealms _ above all, its claim to the legendary Northwest Passage.\n","\n   The dramatic changes in one of the world's most vulnerable\nenvironmental zones and critical strategic arenas are making\nreality of the ancient dream of an east-west sea lane that would\nshave thousands of miles from the ocean routes between the markets\nof Asia and those of Europe and eastern North America.\n","\n   The result could be the biggest change in global shipping\npatterns since the construction of the Panama Canal, completed in\n1914.\n","\n   ``Extraordinary international issues are quite literally riding\non thin ice,'' said Rob Huebert, associate director of the Center\nfor Military and Strategic Studies at Alberta's University of\nCalgary, a specialist on Arctic issues. ``At stake is control of a\nsea lane of potentially major importance.''\n","\n   Disagreements over the right to transit the northern channels\nhave for decades been a source of usually low-key but occasionally\nbitter diplomatic sparring between the United States and Canada.
