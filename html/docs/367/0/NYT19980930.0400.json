They may yet do that.

So, too, did the adjacent hotels, though several\nhundred of the 14,000 rooms suffered water damage when their\nwindows were smashed.\n\n   ``We always said we could build casinos that would ride one out\nand we did,'' Harry Joachim, the executive director of the Biloxi\nChamber of Commerce, said Wednesday, relief in his voice, as repair\ncrews and cleanup teams labored to put everything back in order.\n\n   ``I don't want to say we weren't lucky,'' he added, ``because\nthe whole Gulf Coast was pretty lucky this time around. But we came\nthrough as advertised.''\n\n   Still, most casinos will probably be shut down for the better\npart of a week for repairs and refurbishing, which will cost them,\ntogether, better than $3 million a day in gambling revenue, and\nperhaps that much more again in lodging, restaurant and other\nrevenues.\n\n   ``They're going to come out of this OK but it's going to set\nthem back a bit for a while in revenue and the number of patrons\nplaying,'' said Jason Ader, a gambling analyst for Bear Stearns.\n\n   At least one casino, Treasure Bay, could be shut down for almost\ntwo weeks. Its barge, which actually looks like a pirate ship\ninstead of part of a hotel, suffered some hull damage _ above the\nwaterline _ when surging seas slammed it against some pilings.\n\n   ``It was designed to pull itself away from the shore and ride\nout storms while moored fore and aft between two sets of big\nposts,'' Barbara Shattles, Treasure Bay's executive vice president,\nsaid. ``But it cut loose a little bit too much and took some hard\nbanging. Still, we consider the system a big success.''\n\n   Most other Biloxi barges not only do not look like pirate ships\nor any other kind of vessel but also do not sit as exposed to open\nwater as the Treasure Bay barge, which is docked on the beach\nfront. Some are nestled in coves, while others lie behind\nbreakwaters, protective measures that stood up well against\nGeorges.\n\n   Just west of Biloxi, at Gulfport, the Copa, another casino that\nmore resembles a boat than a barge, rode out Georges by taking on\nwater as ballast. It, too, suffered only minimal damage, according\nto gaming officials.\n\n   ``We feel pretty good about the way things turned out,'' Chuck\nPatton, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission,\nsaid. ``The fact is, for all the dire warnings, the casinos are\ndesigned to take a lot more than Georges offered.
