Nixon made headlines when he went to China in 1972,\nand John Adams and Alice Goodman made headlines 15 years later when\nthey made an opera about that historic journey. The production of\n``Nixon in China'' Peter Sellars created for the Houston Grand\nOpera went round the world, and it made its composer famous in some\nquarters, notorious in others.\n\n   Paradoxically there has not been a complete performance of\n``Nixon in China'' in New York since its debut season. This week\nRobert Spano leads concert performances of the opera with the\nBrooklyn Philharmonic and two members of the original cast, James\nMaddalena (Nixon) and Thomas Hammons (Henry Kissinger).\n\n   The Brooklyn performances coincide with Nonesuch's release of\n``The John Adams Earbox,'' a 10-CD celebration of the composer's\nunparalleled 14-year association with the label. The box collects\nmost of Nonesuch's Adams recordings, along with a new recording of\n``Harmonium,'' and two previously unrecorded works, ``Slonimsky's\nEarbox'' and ``Lollapalooza.''\n\n   Recently Adams came onto the phone from the Nonesuch offices to\ntalk about his career as a ``California composer'' who was born in\nWorcester (Feb. 15, 1947) and whose education included six years at\nHarvard.\n\n   ``I was at Harvard from 1965 to 1971, the turbulent years, in\nthe thick of it all,'' Adams says. ``The month before I graduated\nas an undergraduate was when Harvard Yard was invaded by the Boston\nPolice. I didn't occupy University Hall, but I did march, and I was\nonce chased down Mass Ave. by a cop from Brockton. It was like a\nduck shoot for the police. I was bonked on the backside and I lost\nmy glasses, but I have no real stripes to show for the\nexperience.''\n\n   Adams describes his academic experiences with some care. ``There\nwere key people who were very meaningful to me, above and beyond\nall, Luise Vosgerchian. I met her before I went to Harvard, when I\nwas still a high school kid, at a summer course up at Darmouth. She\ndiscovered me. I had a lot of weaknesses. I was not really a\npianist, not really a clarinetist, but she was able to see whatever\nwas there in its embryonic form, and she encouraged me. That's why\nI still feel an enormous affection and gratitude towards her.\nLater, during my time at Harvard, I came into contact with Leon\nKirchner, and he is so strong a figure that it was impossible not\nto be influenced by him in one way or another. We still stay in\ntouch today.''\n\n   During his Harvard period, Adams says he was more active as a\nconductor than as a composer. ``One of my events there was a\nproduction of `The Marriage of Figaro' in Leverett House that I\nconducted. It was directed by John Lithgow, and one of the sopranos\nwas Lucy Shelton. I also conducted the Bach Society Orchestra,\nwhich provided an opportunity which no other university or\nconservatory in the country offers; I could do everything.''\n\n   Adams says he began composing ``in earnest'' during his senior\nyear. ``This was the period of high modernism. The faculty was torn\nbetween Schoenberg and Stravinsky; that was the big issue. Webern,\nif not consciously, at least obliquely, was held up to us as a\nmodel of what a composer should be. I was experiencing severe\ncognitive dissonance between Paine Hall and Harvard Square. This\nwas a time, between 1968 and '71, when I could encounter some of\nthe greatest pop music ever produced. I even wrote rock criticism\nfor The Crimson, and I realized, `Now wait a moment, there's a\nmajor split going on here.' On the one hand, I was being a good boy\nand writing what was expected of me; on the other hand, what I\nreally loved was far looser, more in touch with American culture,\nand more expressive of what it means to be an American living at\nthis time.''\n\n   The result was inevitable. ``I fled in my Volkswagen bug. I went\nto San Francisco, where the only person I knew was the late\ncomposer Ivan Tcherepnin, who was teaching at the San Francisco\nConservatory. Ivan was one of the dearest people I have ever known.\nI found a job on the waterfront, working in a warehouse in Oakland.\nI had a year of being a blue-collar worker and then I realized I\nwas not going to be able to make an Ivesian career out of composing\non the weekends.''\n\n   Gradually Adams began to discover his voice. He taught and\nconducted new-music concerts at the San Francisco Conservatory; he\ncomposed his first ``minimalist'' works, ``Phrygian Gates'' for\npiano and ``Shaker Loops'' for string septet. He made a connection\nwith Edo de Waart, who appointed him new-music adviser for the San\nFrancisco Symphony, and in 1981 he composed ``Harmonium.''   \n   \nRecording relationship   \n  \n\n   The connection with Nonesuch came in 1984, thanks to\n``Harmonium.'' ``That's when I met Bob Hurwitz, who runs the\ncompany. Back then he was working for ECM, which is mostly a jazz\nlabel, the label of Keith Jarrett. But the company wanted to branch\nout and do some new orchestral music. They sent Bob out to San\nFrancisco when the first performance of `Harmonium' was going on,\nand we made the first recording. Within a year, Bob had moved over\nto Nonesuch, and I was one of the first people he called. He\nproposed a long-term relationship, on the model of what Stravinsky\nhad had at Columbia Records, but I think my relationship with\nNonesuch has been far better than either Stravinsky or Aaron\nCopland enjoyed with Columbia. Nonesuch has been absolutely\nfaithful and devoted, and they have recorded the good, the bad, and\nthe ugly.''\n\n   The recording of ``Harmonium'' with de Waart and the San\nFrancisco Symphony was on ECM, never on Nonesuch, so there is a new\nrecording, with Adams himself conducting the San Francisco Symphony\nand Chorus, in the ``Earbox.'' The set includes highlights from the\ncomplete recordings of ``Nixon in China'' and ``The Death of\nKlinghoffer,'' as well as the single disc of ``I Was Looking At The\nCeiling and Then I Saw The Sky,'' which was never recorded\ncomplete.\n\n   One controversial scene from ``The Death of Klinghoffer,'' the\nKlinghoffer family gathered around the television console, was\nnever recorded, and Adams has dropped it from the score. ``I lopped\nit off, not only because it was unnecessarily controversial and\nmisleading, but it also made the first act ridiculously long. And\nit didn't add to the gravity of the work. My only fear is that one\nday somebody like Roger Norrington will unearth it and peform it!\nPierre Boulez once said that the worst thing he could imagine would\nbe to recreate the premiere of his `Le Marteau sans Maitre.' ''\n\n   All three Adams operas were first staged by Peter Sellars, and\nSellars has been involved in one of Adams's big, new upcoming\nprojects, an oratorio about the life of Christ that will be\npremiered next December in Paris. ``It can be done as a fully\nstaged work or as an oratorio. With Peter there is some deep\nchemistry that seems to work despite the fact we fight tooth and\nnail every inch of the way, particularly once we get up on stage.\nMy past is as a lapsed Episcopalian, but one of the few rituals I\nlove is the Christmas season. I think this story is something I\nhave always wanted to do, and something he might like to stage, the\nway he staged Stravinsky's `Oedipus Rex.' The texts are all by\nHispanic women _ Mexican, Nicaraguan, Chilean _ along with the King\nJames Version of the Bible. Alice Goodman was originaly involved\nwith this project too, but had to withdraw, but I want to say how\nfervently I hope to work with her again.''\n\n   ``Nixon'' is due for a new staging in London and later in San\nFrancisco. ``There will also be a new production of `Klinghoffer'\nin Finland, so despite what you may read in The New York Times, the\nopera is alive and healthy. My feeling about opera is that writing\none is a little like buying a long-term bond. There is so little\nroom in the repertory, that it takes time, often several\ngenerations, for a new work to break in. Look at Leonard\nBernstein's `Candide' and how much ridicule that took before it\nstarted being done. It was completely dormant at the time I was\ngrowing up, but now of course it is recognized as an important part\nof the American repertory.''   \n   \nMajor minimalist   \n  \n\n   Adams was a key figure in the so-called ``minimalist school,''\nalthough he wrote comparatively little purely minimalist music.\n``We use handles to describe things, and they are very useful. If I\nsay `Victorian novel,' you know I am not talking about Joyce.\nMinimalism has been a major force in my musical language, and I\ndon't have a problem with the term; people know what we're talking\nabout when you use the word, and it is threaded through my music.\nSome pieces show more minimalist principles than others. `The Death\nof Klinghoffer' was a kind of watershed for me, a very serious\nstory engaging very heavy issues. Much as I love the minimalist\nclassics, they operate on a certain level, not superficial _ but on\na narrow emotional band width. I felt absolutely prodded by the\nstory and by Alice Goodman's text to find a language that was\ndeeper and more complex, and I took a lot of criticism for that. My\nlanguage became less rigorous, more diffuse, more synthetic. I came\nout of the opera with a larger, more volatile, compositional\npalette, including dissonance, and a more mercurial formal\nlanguage. I have followed it with some kind of wacky results.''\n\n   By ``wacky'' Adams probably means ``unpredictable.'' The Chamber\nSymphony, for example, he describes as ``very good-natured.'' The\nViolin Concerto, on the other hand, ``starts off in `Klinghoffer'\nmode and then lights off into new territory. My most recent pieces\nare `Century Rolls,'' for piano and orchestra, and a big orchestral\npiece, `Naive and Sentimental Music.' I'm still so close to these\npieces that I can't tell you where the language has gone or is\ngoing, except that it may be more emphatically tonal than ever.\nI've been heartened to see composers of younger generations taking\nwhat I did as a cue for a more embracing synthesis of languages\nrather than pursuing any kind of purist or modernist path.''\n","Headline":"\nJOHN ADAMS LISTENS TO HIS OWN PAST \n","Text":["\n   Richard M.
