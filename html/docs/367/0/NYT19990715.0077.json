(We had to pay a 30-foot minimum docking fee since the\nslips are not designed for wee little boats.)\n\n   Kevin believes, as do most hard-core boaters, that you should\nput all your disposable income, as well as indisposable income,\ninto your boat.\n\n   I told Kev that we had come all the way from Key Largo _ 120\nmiles by sea _ and he was impressed. Any 50-foot yacht can do that,\nbut a 17-footer?\n\n   ONE FINE 17-FOOT BOAT\n\n   I set off on this odyssey with Palm Beach Post photographer Paul\nMilette, and before Paul gets mad at me, let me say right away that\nhis boat is one fine 17-foot boat. It doesn't have a cabin, galley,\nbeds or toilet, but it does have a canopy and space for a cooler.\n\n   His 14-year-old daughter, Amy, who took a Coast Guard-approved\nsafe boating course and has a boating license like her dad, served\nas first mate.\n\n   The boat had a Global Positioning System, which has satellite\ncommunication that told us our latitude and longitude. This mostly\nhelped us find restaurants. But it also kept us from ending up in\nMexico.\n\n   We also had a depth finder, which is crucial in the shallows on\nthe gulf side of the Keys. During the five-day round trip, we\nrarely got in water over 10 feet deep and a couple of times ended\nup in about 18 inches and had to back out into the deep channel.\n\n   The water is so clear it's hard to tell the depth by eyeballing\nit. You can see sponges, conch and sea urchins on the sandy bottom\nas clearly at 10 feet as two. You can admire every stripe on an\nangelfish, and you can clearly see the stingrays darting around\nlike spaceships.\n\n   The flats are full of trails made by boat propellers that have\ntorn up protected grasses and coral.\n\n   GO AHEAD, WRECK MY DAY\n\n   The early islanders made a living from ships that wrecked on the\noceanside reefs. Legend accuses them of helping the mishaps along\nby intentionally misplacing lights, perhaps thinking, well, that's\nwhat outsiders get for intruding into the Keys.\n\n   But a boat, especially one that can go in shallow water, is\nstill the best way to see this string of hundreds of\nmangrove-covered islands, which separate the ocean and gulf. By\ncar, you go over 42 bridges. By boat, you're not bothered with such\nmanmade inventions.\n\n   In a car, we would have missed the stingray jumping out of the\nwater and staying airborne long enough for us to make the\ntransition from ``What the heck is that?'' to ``It's a stingray!''\n\n   In Marathon, we saw a manatee drinking fresh water from a hose,\nits gray whiskered face out of the water as it gulped. (Don't do\nthis. Manatees shouldn't be encouraged to hang out with people\nbecause they end up getting run over by boats.)\n\n   Channel markers for the Intracoastal Waterway, which goes to Key\nWest, and other channels served as perches for anhingas. Anhingas\ncan go underwater to search for fish; as our boat neared, they\nwould shoot from the water like rockets.\n\n   REAR VIEW OF MALLORY\n\n   In Key West, we got to see the sunset from the water and saw the\nbackside of the performers at Mallory Dock, literally. The\ntightrope walker's tights were so threadbare we almost had to cover\nAmy's eyes.\n\n   As the sun set, a fleet of chartered clipper ships got smaller\nand smaller on the horizon. I imagined the ladies up on the widow's\nwalks of the houses in Old Town watching their husbands leave in\nthe last two centuries. And the men _ what were they thinking? A\nyear out on a wooden boat with no GPS or depth finder, or cooler\nfull of cold drinks.\n\n   We also saw some of the aftermath of Hurricane Georges, which\nhit the Keys last year. Huge sailboats that had been thrown on\nsandbars were still waiting to be towed. Miles of coastal trees\nwere brown, burned by saltwater during the storm. A houseboat's\nwindows had been blown out, but the tattered curtains remained,\nbillowing in the wind.\n\n   The eeriest moment was seeing empty plastic jugs tied together\nand floating on the ocean several miles from land. As darkness\ndescended, the jugs swept by us in the current, and I saw that they\nwere attached to the bow of a big, upended sailboat. The boat\npopped up about a foot out of the ocean as it passed us, like\nCarrie's hand coming out of the grave.\n\n   During our trip, I watched the colors of water and sky change by\nthe hour. In the middle of our first day, the gulf was flat and the\nsame light gray as the sky, making it impossible to distinguish the\nhorizon.\n\n   ROUGH SEAS\n\n   On the last two days, the water was dark blue and rough. On the\nway to a restaurant in Marathon on our last night, we were drenched\nwhen we broadsided an ocean swell. We sat through dinner wet and\nsticky. But what the heck, we were starving.\n\n   The nighttime excursions were the best. Skinny, skittish needle\nfish, reflecting silver moonlight, jumped out of the water one\nnight. We stopped the boat and were surrounded by leaping,\nsplashing fish.\n\n   We saw brilliant Venus in the west and red Mars in the east, and\na gazillion stars reflected on the water.\n\n   It made me wish Paul's boat at least had a deck to sleep on.\n\n   For information about the Keys, call (800) FLA-KEYS.\n\n   HOW WE MADE THE TRIP\n\n   The journey: We pulled our boat by trailer to Key Largo and\nspent five days discovering the Keys.\n\n   The boat: A 1996 Key West 17 with a 1996 Johnson 88 SPL outboard\nmotor. The 17-foot boat has a Bimini top.\n\n   The seas: The sea conditions were mainly calm to a light chop.\nThe roughest water was when we went from the gulf to the Atlantic\nat Bahia Honda State Park and traveled through to Key West.\n\n   We found much nicer water on the gulf side, but don't be fooled.\nThe sea conditions can be as treacherous as the ocean.\n\n   Equipment: Make sure you have all your Coast Guard approved\nsafety gear aboard your boat:\n\n   Life jackets for all aboard.\n\n   At least one throwable PFD (personal floatation device).\n\n   A fire extinguisher, some type of whistle or horn, an anchor and\nplenty of line.\n\n   A VHF radio and a cell phone.\n\n   Make sure all your navigation and anchor lights are operating _\nyou'll be out for sunsets and dinner after dark. Our Global\nPositioning System came in handy marking coordinates of snorkeling\nspots and for its compass headings.\n\n   Tips: Don't assume everything on your charts is accurate. We had\none chart that showed markers through the center of the lower keys,\nbut when we ventured that way, we could not find any of the channel\nmarkers the map showed. Ask questions at marinas and try to gather\nas much local knowledge as possible.\n\n   The color of the water is a clue to its depth.\n\n   Reef formations and sea grass beds that grow close to the\nwater's surface will make the water appear brown. Sand bars and\nshallow rubble areas appear white. These two water colors should be\navoided in your boat, both for the health of the habitat and the\nhealth of your boat's bottom. Green water usually indicates an area\nfree of shallow reefs or sea grass beds.\n\n   Navigation of small, shallow draft boats in these areas is\ngenerally safe. However, larger, deeper draft boats should exercise\ncaution.\n\n   Information: The National Oceanic Atmosphere Administration\noffers charts and navigational information for the Keys and can be\nreached at its Charts and Publications Branch at 301-436-6990.\n\n   The National Marine Sanctuary Program also has a lot of good\ninformation for traveling the Keys by boat.
