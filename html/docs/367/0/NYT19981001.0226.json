Children will\nenjoy pirate ships, working mills and sugar plantations, as well as\ntram rides past the stalagmites and stalactites of Harrison's Cave.\n\n   The first Europeans to discover the island were the Portuguese,\nwho dubbed it Barbados, or bearded ones, after the Bearded Fig\ntrees that grew along the beaches.\n\n   But English settlers came soon after and Barbados was a British\ncolony from 1627 to 1966, when it gained independence.\n\n   Still, the British influence is felt everywhere you go.\n\n   Residents drive on the left side of the road. They speak English\nwith a lovely lilt. Cricket is the national sport.\n\n   Many hotels are British-owned, offering afternoon tea served on\nrattan-furnished patios alongside buttered scones.\n\n   Bridgetown even comes to life around a Trafalgar Square, which\nhas a statue of Lord Nelson, sculpted by Sir Richard Westmacott and\npredating its London equivalent by 36 years.\n\n   The monarchy in England remains the head of state, while the\njustice system and parliamentary style of government are both\nborrowed from the United Kingdom. As an island steeped in\ndemocratic tradition, the House of Assembly here is the third\noldest parliament in the hemisphere, celebrating its 350th\nanniversary in 1989.\n\n   Today the 166-square-mile island supports a population of\n266,000 people, many of whom are descendants of Africans brought\nhere as slaves to toil on vast sugar plantations.\n\n   Islanders call themselves Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz''). They\nare polite, friendly, and highly educated. The literacy rate of\nnearly 98 percent is the highest in the English-speaking world.\n\n   Like a small town, everyone here seems to know everyone else,\nand drivers wave to one another as a matter of course. Bajans are\nvery religious, and the island has more churches than days in the\nyear. Surprisingly, they are also nutty about their horoscopes,\nconsuming them in their daily newspaper faster than the front-page\nheadlines.\n\n   Despite the island's historical ties with Britain, children are\nbecoming increasingly influenced by American culture, with most\naspiring to be Michael Jordan when they grow up.\n\n   Bajans are a people who appreciate their past.\n\n   There's a strong preservation movement here and a dynamic\nNational Trust that has salvaged not only the forts, churches, and\nplantation estates -- called ``great houses'' here -- of the\ncolonials, but the heritage of black national heroes as well.\n\n   Fort Charles on Needham Point, which now forms part of the\ngardens surrounding the Hilton Hotel, was the largest of the many\nforts that guarded the island's south and west coastlines.\n\n   St. Nicholas Abbey, dating from about 1650, is one of the oldest\ndomestic structures in the region, and one of only three surviving\nexamples of Jacobean architecture in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n   There are two great houses near Six Cross Roads, where the\nEaster Rebellion of 1816 took place.\n\n   The Easter Rebellion was an uprising by slaves who mistakenly\nthought that a bill had been introduced in the English parliament\ngranting them their freedom. The slaves destroyed many acres of\ncane fields when they thought plantation owners were denying them\nthat freedom. Although no owners or their families were killed,\nseveral hundred slaves were killed in a battle that quickly crushed\nthe rebellion, while other slaves were hanged afterwards.\n\n   One great house in the area is Sunbury Plantation, some 300\nyears old. The house is elegantly decorated in Georgian style, and\nmost furnishings are mahogany. The other great house is Oughterson\nPlantation, near the Barbados Zoo Park.\n\n   The island boasts several impressive castles, notorious Sam\nLord's being among the most popular. This castle, built in 1820 and\nsince restored, was a hideout for the infamous pirate who,\naccording to legend, assembled a fortune by plundering boats that\nbecame shipwrecked after he lured them onto Cobbler's Reef.\n\n   Near Trafalgar Square, you can easily walk to St. Michael's\nCathedral, built in the 18th century. You can then stop by the\nSynagogue, an early 19th-century building on the site of a\n17th-century one, one of the two earliest in the hemisphere. You\ncan see the Gothic-style Parliament Building, built in 1872.\n\n   About three miles away is the much-visited statue of a freed\nslave that celebrates Barbadians' full emancipation from slavery\n160 years ago.\n\n   But if you grow tired of all the statues and architectural\ntreasures, you can veer away from Trafalgar Square toward Broad\nStreet, where duty-free goods ranging from clothes to cameras are\nsold.\n\n   You can also savor mouth-watering cuisine and some of the best\nfresh fish around.\n\n   Flying fish come two or three to a plate, usually fried. Dolphin\n-- the fish and not the beloved mammal -- is good and served at\nmost restaurants. Cou-cou (pronounced ``Koo-koo'') is a starchy\ndish usually made with tree-grown breadfruit. Pumpkin is a staple,\nserved as everything from pumpkin soup to pumpkin fritters.\n\n   So if you come to Barbados, it might be easy to stay at the\nbeach, sipping rum punch and soaking up the sun. But you'd be\nmissing a lot. When it comes to the Caribbean, Barbados is one\nisland where there's plenty to do, none of which has anything to do\nwith sand and surf.\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ When travelers think Caribbean, they\nthink swaying palm trees, pina coladas under a glazing sun, and a\nwarm sea that's as clear as gin.\n","\n   The island of Barbados is all that, but it's also much more than\njust a perfect spot to get a tan.\n","\n   Barbados is the furthest east of the West Indies, which arc from\nSouth America to North America.\n","\n   The island is rich in history, with a variety of sites dating\nback to early in the 17th century.\n","\n   It's also rich in shopping, watersports, and tasty cuisine, with\na wide array of good restaurants.\n","\n   With names like Brighton Beach, Hastings, Worthing, and Dover,\nthis former British colony has the feel of a foreign country, but\nit is not so exotic as to throw you off-center.\n","\n   At the same time, this capital city -- though not much to look\nat -- boasts some of the best nightlife in the region, much of it\ncentered in the one-room rumshops at Baxters(CQ) Road.\n","\n   Since most people live comfortably, what Barbados does not have\nis a lot of the irksome hassle from street hawkers, or the poverty\nthat's so visible in shantytowns and rural areas in other parts of\nthe Caribbean.\n","\n   But if it's the beaches you want, then beaches you can get,\nparticularly along the island's sheltered west coast, where\ntame-as-a-kitten waves lap the smooth sands of some of the finest\nbeaches in the Caribbean, especially around Speightstown.\n","\n   Then for those who shun the beach, there's the rugged shoreline\non the Atlantic side, with its enticing caves, powerful waves,\njagged rock ridges, and an undertow that's so beastly there are\nscads of signs to warn one against taking a dip.\n","\n   Though not frequented by swimmers, this side is quite popular\nwith surfers.\n","\n   Barbados is also a pleasant family destination.
