But those\nget-rich-quick TV commercials that scream invitingly, ``You can be\nyour own boss'' have nothing on the way some NFL coaches are\ngrabbing up self-determining job authority. And getting paid big\nmoney for it.\n\n   ``There are examples of guys who are coach/general managers who\nhave success because they have a system,'' says Mike Holmgren, who\ndeparted Green Bay last week for total control with Seattle and\nreceived an eight-year, $32 million deal to create his own\nmonarchy. ``Dan Reeves, Mike Shanahan, Jimmy Johnson, they all have\nthe authority in their organizations, and they are all successful,\nbecause they have their systems and they believe in them.''\n\n   Total control is in vogue.\n\n   Look at this NFL postseason: Of the final eight teams, six of\nthem _ Denver with Shanahan, Miami with Johnson, the Jets with\nParcells, Jacksonville with Tom Coughlin, Minnesota with Dennis\nGreen and Atlanta with Reeves _ are run by coaches in charge of\nvirtually everything. This weekend's AFC and NFC championship\ngames, featuring the Jets at Denver and Atlanta at Minnesota, make\nthe final four a clean sweep for the do-it-yourself concept.\n\n   ``Look,'' Parcells says, ``I don't mind if anybody thinks,\n`That's guy's a jerk.' Because I do know that they also think,\n`Hey, he's doing everything he can to help us win.' ''\n\n   Total control doesn't always work. This season, in addition to\nthe aforementioned six success stories, there were, counting Dave\nWannstedt in Chicago (whose power diminished with the hiring of\npersonnel boss Mark Hatley), six other total-control coaches: Dick\nVermeil at St. Louis, Mike Ditka at New Orleans, Dom Capers at\nCarolina, Dennis Erickson at Seattle and Bobby Ross at Detroit.\n\n   The six success stories' combined record is 87-20. But the six\nfailures combined in 1998 for a 27-53 record _ and three firings.\n\n   Indeed, the format simply doesn't allow for employees who don't\npull in the same direction as the boss. And that is the major\nupside to total control: In the event of failure, it leaves no room\nfor buck-passing. Also, there is a major downside to total control:\nEven in the event of success, the egomania inherent in the makeup\nof the men who desire it can eventually be their undoing.\n\n   ``It's not a cure-all,'' says Dolphins executive Bob Ackles, a\nJohnson cohort in Dallas and Miami who also labored in a failed\nsystem in Philadelphia. ``It depends on who the hire is, what the\norganization is. But at least you know who's in charge, who's\nanswerable.'' PARCELLS THE EPITOME The optimal model of the perfect\ntotal controller, blemishes and all, is Parcells.\n\n   Parcells, arguably ``the'' reason his Jets are in the AFC\nChampionship Game, is a gypsy, not exactly denying rumors he might\nretire this year if the Jets win it all. He is a guy always on the\nlookout for greener grass. He is a bully, not above questioning the\nmanhood of one of his own injured players by publicly calling him\n``a girl.'' He is a rebel, scoffing at league rules ordering him to\nfacilitate better communication with the media.\n\n   Oh, and he might be as good a coach as ever lived.\n\n   The wisdom of some total-control designations seems dubious;\nGeorge Seifert's claim to fame is using his professorial skills to\ncontinue San Francisco predecessor Bill Walsh's tradition through\nthe 1990s. Yet here he is this month receiving $2.5 million a year\nto coach and, for the first time in his life, to be general\nmanager, in Carolina.\n\n   And Johnson, given total authority in Miami, this week seemed\nabout to crumble under the pressure before yesterday deciding to\nrescind his resignation while changing his job to allow for more\npersonal time.\n\n   The Panthers might get lucky with Seifert. The odds seem better\nwith Holmgren in Seattle. And Johnson could conceivably be more\neffective in avoiding being overworked. But the only sure thing\nseems to be Parcells, now the first coach to ever take three\ndifferent teams to conference title games _ and he's done it all in\nthe span of this decade.\n\n   Parcells worked with general manager George Young to build the\nGiants into a Super Bowl champion in 1986. Then, after a short\ncycle of mediocrity, he did it again with another Giants' Super\nBowl title in 1990. Then the nomadic Parcells, who had earlier\ntried to escape his New York contract for the Atlanta job, left,\neventually landing with New England.\n\n   Parcells' Patriots won 11 games in 1996 and went to the Super\nBowl, but all season, he was embroiled in a struggle for power with\nhis front office. Parcells again escaped, this time to the Jets,\nwho had finished 1-15 in the year before his arrival in '97.\n\n   Since then, with the same developing young talent Parcells\nacquired, New England's Pete Carroll has finished with 10 and then\nnine wins. Meanwhile, Parcells took over the entire operation of\nthe NFL-worst Jets, built them to 9-7 last year, then to 12-4 this\nregular season, now to Sunday's AFC Championship Game in Denver.\n\n   Add it up: Since Parcells jumped ship, already-good New England\nis 19-13. Once-horrible New York is 21-11, and counting.\n\n   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' says Curtis Martin, Parcells'\nfeatured back in both New England and New York, ``coach Parcells is\nthe best coach to ever coach anything.'' ONE MAN'S AURA Holmgren's\nagent, Bob LaMonte, says, ``To me, it's clear-cut. You have a model\nhere: you have an owner, you have a president and you have the\nperson who runs the football operation.''\n\n   There is something intangible to most of these men, something\nGod-given. A knack. An aura.\n\n   Not unlike Parcells' history is Reeves' background. He was hired\nin Denver and four years later he's a Super Bowl contender. He\nmoves to the Giants and immediately they're a championship\ncontender. He moves to Atlanta, and after starting 0-7 in 1997, the\nsad-sack Falcons are 60 minutes away from a Super Bowl.\n\n   ``The difference here has been Dan, no question about it,'' says\nAtlanta quarterback Chris Chandler. ``He just came in and\nimmediately commanded everybody's respect. There's a\nprofessionalism there you don't see with many coaches, and this\nteam took on his personality.''\n\n   So add aura to intelligence. And add the total controller's\ndesire to be married to his job, to winning. Reeves, as an example,\nunderwent quadruple bypass surgery late in the season. Yet his\nteam's 20-18 playoff victory against San Francisco featured him on\nthe sidelines, just 17 days after his release from the hospital.\n\n   ``This is what I want to do, and my health has never crossed my\nmind and still doesn't cross my mind when it comes to the ability\nto do my job,'' Reeves says. ``I'm not looking to retire. I enjoy\nit too much. It's too much a part of me.''\n\n   Look closely, and you'll see that among the keys to most of the\ntotal controllers' success is their ability to delegate.\n\n   Despite Reeves' health problems, the Falcons didn't falter,\nbecause his defensive coordinator, ex-Rams head coach Rich Brooks,\nwas equipped to run the club in his absence. Parcells' history is\nas a defensive expert, but his top assistant is Bill Belichick, and\nhe runs the Jets' defense. Johnson gets the headlines in Miami, but\none of his greatest accomplishments is surrounding himself with\ncapable worker ants like Ackles, and now, assistant head coach Dave\nWannstedt.\n\n   Denver general manager John Beake offers an interesting case.\nThe Broncos are Shanahan's organization _ his media nickname is\n``Mastermind.'' But Beake, in his 14th year as the Broncos GM,\npreceded him in Denver. Beake has worked on the business side of\nthe sport, as a personnel director, and as a coach on the NFL,\ncollege and high-school levels. That's a resume strong enough to\nopen doors for Beake if he ever wanted to become a recognizable\nname.\n\n   ``None of us in Denver are dedicated to that,'' Beake says.\n``There are all different sorts of ways to do it, but here, with\n\\Rowner Pat\\S Bowlen and Shanahan, we all contribute, we all go in\nthe same direction. The other stuff doesn't matter.''\n\n   The same can't be said for most of the total controllers. The\negos of Johnson and Parcells manifest themselves in bluster. The\negos of Ross and Coughlin result in Pattonesque military\napproaches. And human beings, even the relatively modest ones, like\nhaving the red carpet rolled out. When Holmgren arrived in Seattle\nfor his interview, he flew in on an airplane that arrived at owner\nPaul Allen's private hangar, then rode in a limousine that whisked\naway him and his entire family, then retired to Seattle's elegant\nFour Seasons Olympic Hotel.\n\n   When another lesser candidate for the job, Jim Haslett, arrived\nin Seattle, he flew commercial. Carrying his own bags.\n\n   Even the apparently quiet types, like the defending Super Bowl\nchampion Broncos' Shanahan, seem to need outlets to prove their\nabilities to control not just contracts and salaries and free\nagency and the draft, but to also control life-and-death matters.\n\n   Shanahan recently bought a Harley-Davidson motorcycle,\nparticipates in bungee-jumping in Cancun, cliff-diving in the\nCaribbean and auto racing on the NASCAR track in Las Vegas, driving\nat 160 mph.\n\n   Would one call that symptomatic of the total controller?\n\n   ``No,'' corrects Shanahan's wife, Peggy, the rarity in the NFL\nas a person who can control the total controller. ``I'd call that\nstupid.''\n","Headline":"\nTOTAL CONTROL WORKS FOR SOME COACHES\n","Text":["\n   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Omnipotent, autocratic, dictator-like total\ncontrol.\n","\n   Is that so much for an NFL coach to ask?\n","\n   ``If I'm going to cook the food, I want to shop for the\ngroceries,'' says the NFL's consummate total controller, New York\nJets coach/general/manager/czar Bill Parcells, explaining why he\nwants to be in charge of determining more than just what goes on\nbetween the end zones.\n","\n   The next trend in the NFL is here: Total control for coaches.\nTotal control for coaches who want the power to determine their own\nrosters, their own staffs, their own fates.\n","\n   ``Bill Parcells wants to control everything,'' says Jets\nlinebacker Bryan Cox. ``He wants to be God.''\n","\n   The NFL doesn't offer quite that authority.
