Times News Service   \n\n   Some modern kitchens are geared up with enough equipment to\nretool the Mir space station, yet still manage to invoke the\nwell-bred charm of Jane Austen's parlor. Tea anyone? It can be\nsteamed up on the Aga or zapped in the microwave oven, then served\nin a room newly commodious with a kitchen sofa, pillows, even an\narmchair.\n\n   The designer has arrived in the kitchen, bringing an eye for\ncreature comforts and materials once reserved for showier parts of\nthe house (yes, even the limestone from the entrance hall). The\nlast barrier between rooms has finally come down.\n\n   Never have there been more soft, rounded edges and waxable woods\nthan in the state-of-the-designer's-art kitchen by Sandra\nNunnerley, a Manhattan interior designer, for Annemarie and Michael\nGarstin and their three children. Working with Douglas Moyer, a Sag\nHarbor, N.Y., architect, Ms. Nunnerley took advantage of a level of\nsophisticated craftsmanship more commonly found in other parts of\nthe house.\n\n   Using strong cornices and tongue-and-groove paneling for the\ncabinetry and turned edges on work tables, the designers have\ncreated an elegantly inviting ambiance for the once nitty-gritty\nworking kitchen. Thus, the return of the copper sink from the tool\nshed, to be used as a basin for cut flowers.\n\n   ``My goal was to make it look like I'd never been there, while\nmaking everything work in an absolutely efficient way,'' said Ms.\nNunnerley, who with the architect reshaped half the ground floor of\na 1906 shingle-style cottage in East Hampton to accommodate a\nsumptuous 950-square-foot kitchen and eating area, sweeping from\nthe formal front to the terraced back of the house.\n\n   At the room's center, an island establishes the kitchen's roots\nas solidly late-20th-century American. But the island is not the\nstandard rectangle recognizable in every prime-time situation\ncomedy. It has an angular Z-shape, with eight usable sides and a\nFive Star range in the middle. The island has two heights _ one at\nchopping height for preparing vegetables; the other, a limestone\ncounter eight inches higher, for bar-style meals on the fly. (The\nlimestone makes a great looking buffet for hot dishes straight out\nof the oven.)\n\n   The original old-fashioned kitchen had been exceedingly dark and\nriddled with small, unusable spaces. Ms. Garstin is the kind of\nweekend chef who wants her family and friends in close proximity as\nshe cooks. The most striking idea was to add a new bay with\nbuilt-in window seats, casement windows and a five-foot-round table\nbeneath a nine-foot ceiling. ``We barely use the dining room\nanymore, even for parties,'' said Ms. Garstin, who owns a public\nrelations agency in Manhattan.\n\n   For families like the Garstins, said Johnny Grey, the author of\n``The Art of Kitchen Design'' (Cassell, 1996), the big kitchen is\nnot a luxury, but the last rendezvous and thoroughfare. ``So much\nof daily life, not just socializing but the coming and the going,\nis focused on the kitchen that in 10 years it will probably have a\ndifferent name,'' he said, adding that the kitchen is no longer the\nroom in the back. ``It's the largest downstairs room in the house,\npulling in elements from all the other rooms around it.''\n\n   As romantic as it looks, the Garstin kitchen works with commando\nefficiency. Ms. Nunnerley asked Ms. Garstin to run through the\ndaily drill: Here's a bag of groceries from the car. Now what?\nFirst off, there had to be plenty of clear counter space near the\ntwo most likely ports of entry, for grocery bags. Within easy reach\nof the counters, two Sub-Zero refrigerators were installed: one for\nfood, one for drinks. The sink for vegetable preparation is on the\nisland next to the stove.\n\n   ``After you clean the veggies, you can turn right around and pop\nthem into the pot,'' Ms. Garstin said. For anyone brandishing a\ncolander of hot dripping pasta, it's a relief to know there's also\na 30-inch-wide porcelain farm sink across from the range. A\nhand-hammered copper bar sink was positioned by the door to the\ndining room.\n\n   Precision planning has not translated into a steely streamlined\nesthetic. Ms. Nunnerley used careful design detailing and a lot of\nwoodwork to disguise the hardware with sitting-room elegance. Even\nthe refrigerators are paneled, and the counters are made of\nmahogany. The designer, who grew up in a creaky old house in New\nZealand, said she shared her enthusiasm for using lots of wood with\nMs. Garstin, a close friend, who was born in Scotland. Ms.\nNunnerley pointed out that the wooden surfaces and stained floors\nadd softness and warmth, making the kitchen feel inviting\nthroughout the year.\n\n   ``So what if it gets a burn mark here and there,'' Ms. Nunnerley\nsaid, scoffing at the notion that wood might be impractical.\n``Americans are such cleanliness freaks. Imperfections are the soul\nof a beautiful house.''\n","Headline":"\n(ATTN: N.Y.)  \n DESIGNERS ARRIVE IN THE KITCHEN \n","Text":["\n   Some modern kitchens are geared up with enough equipment to\nretool the Mir space station, yet still manage to invoke the\nwell-bred charm of Jane Austen's parlor.
