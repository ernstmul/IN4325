Many otherwise prudent\nbuyers have been swept away by the romance of boat ownership only\nto find they have overpaid or overbought, purchasing vessels they\ncan barely afford.\n\n   ``Boat'' doesn't have to stand for ``break out another\nthousand,'' said David Goodner, an Oxnard-based yacht broker.\n\n   Start small and trade up, he advises. And shop smart. The\nfollowing strategies can help you formulate your approach:\n\n   Make a budget: For each $5,000 of boat at a 10 percent interest\nrate on a 60-month loan, expect to pay $106.24 monthly. If you can\nafford $200 a month, don't be tempted to take out a loan that will\nhave you paying the full amount in monthly payments.\n\n   The payments will be only part of the equation, Goodner said.\n``There will be equipment costs, repairs, launch fees, extra fuel,\ninsurance, registration and incidentals associated with the boat.''\n\n   Monthly slip fees can run an additional $350; bottom cleaning\nand maintenance can be $100 a month on larger boats.\n\n   All could keep you high and dry if a budget has not been worked\nout.\n\n   Replace wish list with `needs' list: The savvy buyer will excise\nall features he or she can do without. If an outboard will suffice,\nrule out an inboard/outboard configuration. If you're a sailor and\ndon't absolutely need a spinnaker, do without it.\n\n   That way the shopper is in a better position to look beyond the\nlittle extras that can cloud judgment and promote an emotional\npurchase. A budget and needs list will work in tandem to keep your\nfeet on the ground.\n\n   Consider a used boat: There are some people who only buy boats\nnew. These people are closely related to folks who only buy cars\nnew, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's just expensive.\n\n   ``A new boat may depreciate as much as 20 percent the moment it\nleaves the showroom,'' said Oxnard-based yacht broker Burton Head,\nwho advises prospective owners to take a serious look at the used\nmarket.\n\n   If you are dead-set on buying a new boat, however, there is good\nnews: The value of a quality boat tends to stay flat for many years\nafter the initial depreciation.\n\n   Size up the seller: Parties sell used boats for a variety of\nreasons, but they can generally be pigeonholed into a few\ncategories:\n\n   Those who have bought a vessel only to discover soon after that\nboating wasn't for them. This seller will likely be trying to\nrecoup his investment as best he can and has little motivation to\nreduce the price or sell quickly.\n\n   Those who are trading up and have already made a deposit on a\nbigger boat, a common scenario that signals a very motivated seller\nand likely a craft kept in sound shape.\n\n   ``You know the owner has a love for boating, since he's trading\nup. This means he's probably taken very good care of the boat he's\nselling,'' said Bart Hall, managing partner of Fred Hall Fishing,\nTackle and Boat Shows.\n\n   Those who must sell because of a need for ready cash, often\nbecause of a divorce or move. This, too, is generally a very\nmotivated seller.\n\n   Consider paying cash: There's nothing that drags by more slowly\nthan the final six months on a 48-month boat loan. For a $10,000\nused boat at a 10 percent annual interest rate on a 60-month loan,\nthe interest alone will total $2,748.80 over the full term. That\nworks out to a whopping 27 percent on the principal.\n\n   Besides saving nearly $3,000 in interest payments, being able to\npay cash can help knock the price down.\n\n   Insist on an inventory list: All sellers of boats _ from an\naluminum rowboat to a million-dollar luxury yacht _ should have an\ninventory list. It's critical because it establishes what goes with\nthe boat and what doesn't, and that affects price. Such a list also\nprovides a basis for the buyer to check out the vessel's systems\nand accessories.\n\n   ``When we're showing a boat, it's not uncommon for (buyers) to\ndo their own mini-survey, especially on sailboats. The inventory\nlist is standard,'' said Goodner, who recommends that anyone\nconsidering a purchase also employ a certified marine surveyor.\n\n   Time the purchase of a new boat: ``Factories want to deliver to\ndealers in September, October and November,'' Hall said. ``But\ndealers don't really want to take them then. They would rather take\ndelivery in January, February and March,'' in time for the summer\nboating season.\n\n   Ideally, Hall recommends, boaters may want to buy in late August\nor early September to capitalize on the dealer's desire to move\nlast year's models out of the showroom to make room for new\nmodels.   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nFor the state Department of Boating and Waterways' consumer\nprotection guide for buying a used boat, call (888) 326-2822.\nState-certified broker information: California Yacht Brokers\nAssociation, (800) 875-CYBA.\n","Headline":"\nBOAT BUYERS NEED TO SHOP SMART\n","Text":["\n   LOS ANGELES _ A fishing platform for targeting lunker bass.
