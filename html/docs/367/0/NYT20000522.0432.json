He replaces Eileen Richardson, a\nBoston area investor who became Napster's interim CEO when the\ncompany started nine months ago. She only intended to stay long\nenough to find a permanent boss.\n\n   Both Barry, a former partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati\nin Palo Alto, Calif., and Hummer Winblad partner John Hummer also\njoined Napster's board of directors.\n\n   Barry was unavailable for immediate comment. But in a news\nrelease, he cited a poll released last week that showed more than\n70 percent of college students already use Napster, and nearly 20\npercent use it daily, even though the company has yet to release a\nfinal version of the program.\n\n   ``With over 10 million registered users within its first nine\nmonths, Napster's file-sharing application has become the most\nrapidly adopted technology in the history of the Internet,'' Barry\nsaid.\n\n   Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3\nmusic files through the Internet. According to online and software\nratings firm Media Metrix Inc., Napster was ``virtually\nnonexistent'' in February, but by March had 2.5 million unique\nusers.\n\n   Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and\nnew artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica\nand Dr. Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a\ntool for music piracy.\n\n   Earlier this month, Napster blocked more than 300,000 users\nidentified by Metallica as people who were offering illegal copies\nof the heavy metal band's songs. More than 30,000 have applied for\nreinstatement.\n\n   Last week, Metallica quietly delivered a new list of 332,293\nNapster members that the band wants blocked. Napster spokesman Dan\nWool said the company has not made a decision on blocking members\non the newest Metallica hit list or another list from Dr. Dre\nnaming 239,612 Napster members.\n\n   The Napster debate has also entered the political arena. The\nmoderate Democratic party think tank Progressive Policy Institute\nissued a report Monday calling for Congress to tighten the federal\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act to hold Napster and similar\ntechnology companies more accountable for copyright infringement.\n\n   ``We think Napster is an innovative technology, but we should\nuse that technology in legal ways,'' said Robert Atkinson,\nco-author of the report ``Napster and Online Piracy.''\n\n   The report recommends that Congress change the DMCA to require\nInternet-based services like Napster to obtain ``identifiable and\nverifiable'' information about their users to help track down\ncopyright violators. Napster members can sign on anonymously.\n\n   The report also said the DMCA needs to have more specific\ntimetables for taking down copyright violators because it now gives\nNapster and similar services ``no incentive to act in a timely\nfashion.''\n\n   The report suggests that judges be allowed more flexibility to\ngrant injunctions. ``It may be impossible to write a law that\naccounts for all future technological innovation, but a judge will\nknow a pirate's den when he or she sees it,'' the report said.\n\n   The institute will present the paper at a House Small-Business\nCommittee hearing scheduled for tomorrow to examine Internet music\ntechnologies, but Atkinson admitted he does not expect Congress to\nact anytime in the next several months.\n\n   E-mail Benny Evangelista at    bennye(AT)sfgate.com   .\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster Inc. appointed a new chief executive and\nreceived key financial backing Monday even as a political think\ntank recommended tighter copyright laws to combat illegal swapping\nof online music.\n","\n   The San Mateo, Calif., startup plans to expand its workforce and\noffice space now that it has closed a $15 million round of venture\nfunding led by noted San Francisco investment firm Hummer Winblad\nVenture Partners, along with money from Angel Investors LP.\n","\n   Hummer Winblad partner Hank Barry, a onetime legal counsel for\nmajor media companies like Disney Online and A&M Records, will\nbecome Napster's interim CEO.
