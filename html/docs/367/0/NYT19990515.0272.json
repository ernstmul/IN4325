The boat\nhad no lights on.\n\n   The boats collided. Richardson awoke to a deafening crash.\n\n   Southwood was not hurt, but the Water Patrol found Thurston\ndead, submerged in about 2 feet of water.

Officials there say that only 10 percent of its accidents\ninvolve alcohol, compared with 26 percent in Missouri.\n\n   The penalties for drunken boating in Missouri are much lighter\nthan for drunken driving. The first two violations are\nmisdemeanors. And violators don't have to worry about losing a\nlicense _ boaters are not required to carry one.\n\n   ``It's the same thing as on the highways,'' said Connie Weyer, a\nlongtime boater from Sunrise Beach. ``You have 90 percent of the\npeople who are courteous and 10 percent who don't care.\n\n   ``The same people who would have two or three drinks and not\ndrive a car will drink a six-pack or a 12-pack and drive a 4-ton\nboat.''\n\n   Even though safety experts say life jackets could prevent 80\npercent of fatalities, only a tiny fraction of boaters will wear\nthem.\n\n   Even those who can't swim well often forgo them.\n\n   On July 23, Michael Stobaugh of Matthews took his 10-year-old\nson for a fishing trip on Clearwater Lake in southeast Missouri.\n\n   Stobaugh couldn't swim and wasn't wearing a life jacket.\nMissouri law requires them only for riders of personal watercraft\nand boaters under 7. His son could swim but wore a life jacket\nanyway.\n\n   The water was calm, the temperature 85 degrees.\n\n   Then their boat hit something, and both were thrown into the\nwater.\n\n   Stobaugh's son took off his life jacket and tried to give it to\nhis father. The father refused. The boy screamed for help. As a\npasser-by arrived, Stobaugh slipped underwater and drowned.\n\n   Stobaugh's wife, Marilyn, said she hoped such accidents would\nspur people to wear life jackets, even if the water appeared safe.\nStobaugh said she would ``never, ever, ever'' ride a boat without a\nlife jacket.\n\n   ``I can't stress enough how important it is,'' she said. ``A\nseemingly minor thing can change a person's whole life.''\n\n   Twenty-three persons died in boating accidents last year, and 38\nmore drowned in Missouri waters.
