Within days, illegal copies of the disc could be had\nliterally anywhere on earth.\n\n   Unscrupulous pirates have been selling cheap copies of recorded\nmusic for years. But a new breed of pirates isn't       making\ncrudely-dubbed cassette tapes. Instead, they're creating\nhigh-quality digital copies of the music and publishing it on the\nInternet, where anyone can have a listen.\n\n   These audio thieves do their dirty work for pleasure, not\nprofit. And the tools of their trade are easy to find _ a computer,\nan Internet connection, some inexpensive software, and contempt for\nthe copyright laws.\n\n   ``Someone is helping themselves to our property, and then, in a\nstrange Robin Hoodesque move, is offering that property to\nothers,'' fumes Bob Merlis, a spokesman for R.E.M.'s label, Warner\nBros. Records.\n\n   Yet this computerized piracy may be the least of Merlis'\nworries.\n\n        The same technology could radically change the world of\nrecorded music. It can be used by the recording industry itself to\ntransform the way music is       distributed . Consumers may be able to\nbuy R.E.M.'s next album directly over the Internet, downloading the\nmusic right onto their hard drives. Or they might not buy entire\nalbums at all, but instead download songs one at a time to create\ntheir own ideal albums.\n\n   All this could devastate the business of traditional music\nretailers, on whom the record companies still depend for most of\ntheir sales. And the record companies will have to redesign their\nown business models to cope with a world in which consumers can be\nfar more selective about the music they buy.\n\n   The pioneering technology that makes       Internet music\ndistribution popular, known as MP3, was originally developed to\nenable Hollywood studios to put high-quality movie sound onto\nCD-ROM-sized disks. But MP3 also enables almost anyone with a\npersonal computer to make copies of recorded music that sound\nalmost as good as the original recording. Equally important, MP3\nmusic files are tightly compressed so that hundreds can easily be\nstored on a computer's hard drive, or downloaded from the Internet.\n\n   Over the past year, MP3 has been transformed from a technical\ncuriosity to a popular entertainment system. Free or low-cost MP3\nplayers, software available on many Internet sites, are being used\nby millions to download and record MP3-formated music onto hard\ndrives. A few record companies and recording artists like Eric\nClapton and Dionne Warwick have embraced the technology as a\npromotional tool. They issue sample cuts from new albums on the\nInternet in MP3 format, and encourage visitors to download them and\nlisten.\n\n   Then there are MP3 pirates who use ``ripper'' software to copy\nCDs into the new format and distribute illegal copies far and wide.\n``Anybody with a modern personal computer can pop a CD into the\ncomputer and make an MP3 file out of it,'' says Michael Robertson,\npresident of MP3.com, a leading distributor of legal MP3 music on\nthe Internet.\n\n   MP3 piracy is still only a minor threat to the recording\nindustry. Most home computer users have slow Internet connections,\nso it would still take five or six minutes to download a typical\nMP3 song. Many music lovers would rather buy the disc and be done\nwith it.\n\n   But this bottleneck is quickly disappearing      . Already tens of\nthousands of Americans have high-speed Internet access at home,\nthrough modems connected to their cable TV systems. And a new\nsystem called ADSL will allow very fast downloads over standard\ntelephone lines.\n\n   Dell Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp., two of the biggest\nPC makers, are now selling computers with built-in ADSL modems.\nMost of the nation's telephone companies don't offer the new\nservice yet, but many have begun ADSL service in a few cities. Bell\nAtlantic will start offering the service in Boston next year.\n\n   Soon, downloading an entire album of songs will take just a few\nminutes. And once they're downloaded, they can be converted back\ninto standard music CD format. Then the music can be ``burned''\nonto traditional compact discs       using a CD recorder. Prices for\nthese recorders are now falling below $200, and their growing\npopularity opens a new frontier in music piracy.\n\n   Scary as this might seem to the record companies, there's worse\nto come. Graphics hardware maker Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.\nannounced it would offer a $200 device called Rio, a sort of MP3\nWalkman. Rio plugs into a computer and downloads up to an hour of\nMP3 files from the PC's       hard drive. Then the user can plug in\nheadphones and listen anywhere.\n\n   Rio raises the specter of a cheap, simple device that could make\ndownloading stolen music into a new national pastime. Last month,\nthe Recording Industry Association of America, or RIAA   ,    responded\nwith a federal lawsuit that sought to bar Diamond from selling the\nRio. The RIAA cited the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act, which\nrequires digital home recording equipment to have a circuit that\nprevents making more than one copy of a recording.\n\n   Diamond's attorneys responded that the Rio can only download\nmusic from a computer. It can't load the MP3 files onto another\ncomputer or any other digital device. That was good enough for a\nfederal judge, which rejected the RIAA's demand for an immediate\ninjunction against Diamond. The Rio is set to go on sale at the end\nof November.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nPCS ARE REVOLUTIONIZING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY \n","Text":["\n   Three weeks ago, the popular band R.E.M. released its latest\nalbum, Up.
