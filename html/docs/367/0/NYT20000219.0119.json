Times News Service    \n\n   TULKARM, West Bank _ There is a quiet cult of the bee in the\nland of milk and honey, and beekeepers, be they Israeli or\nPalestinian, are the high priests of the hive.\n\n   It was only a matter of time, then, in a place where passion and\nconflict are so entwined, before the bees of the Holy Land became\nensnared in the tangled web of the peace process.\n\n   ``No bees, no peace,'' read the Hebrew placards at a recent\ndemonstration at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank, protesting\nan epidemic of hive thefts by Palestinians. It was called the\nBeekeepers Revolt.\n\n   Looking like astronauts in their white protective gear, dozens\nof Israeli beekeepers briefly blocked a key entrance to Israel from\nPalestinian territory. With their hives.\n\n   They said the theft, of 2,600 hives in the past year, is\nthreatening not only their livelihood, but _ given the centrality\nthey attach to the bee _ the land of Israel itself. If Israeli\nlawmakers don't pay greater attention to this phenomenon, they say,\nthey will bring their hives to the Parliament.\n\n   ``And, if worse comes to worse, we will release the bees,'' said\nRoni Feldman, a 65-year-old, fourth-generation beekeeper who makes\nan unlikely candidate for apiarist-terrorist. ``This is a struggle\nfor our existence, and I would dare say, since the flowers and the\norchards are so dependent on the bee, for the future of Israel\nitself. That last part is what people don't seem to realize.''\n\n   Israeli and Palestinian beekeepers share this kind of rapture:\nwithout the bee, we are nothing. For the Israelis, it is a Zionist\nthing. For the Palestinians, it is religious _ a whole sura, or\nchapter, Number 17, of the Koran, is devoted to the bee _ and\nnationalist.\n\n   ``Honey is a holy product of the Holy Land,'' said Osman Arafat,\nthe leading beekeeping expert in the West Bank, who decided against\nnaming his company ``Arafat Bee Productions'' so as not to alienate\npotential customers who oppose his namesake, the Palestinian\nleader.\n\n   ``And,'' Arafat continued, ``it is definitely a growth industry\nwith huge potential for our future state.''\n\n   The effect of peacemaking on bee-keeping was probably not\ncontemplated by the signers of the Oslo interim peace agreement of\n1993. But there has been a profound effect, and the story is not\nonly one of conflict but of accommodation and cooperation, too. And\nit underscores that there is nothing abstract about peace between\nIsraelis and Palestinians, who live elbow to elbow and share the\nsame land, acre by acre, honeycomb by honeycomb.\n\n   ``The bottom line is, there is no such thing as a Palestinian or\nan Israeli bee,'' Arafat said. ``They fly freely over checkpoints,\nlinking us through nature.''\n\n   Feldman's 25-year-old son, Ziv, who wears his hair in a ponytail\nand majors in communications at Tel Aviv University, sees it\ndifferently. ``Bees don't like to mix with those who are not from\ntheir hive,'' he said.\n\n   Last week, Arafat and other Palestinian beekeepers graduated\nfrom a five-day training seminar administered by the Israeli\nAgriculture Ministry in Netanya, Israel. Outside the hotel where\nthe seminar was offered, Israeli beekeepers, not including Feldman,\nprotested. But the Israelis' complaint is not really with their\ncolleagues, the true professionals like Arafat, who holds a\nmaster's degree in beekeeping from Belgrade, Yugoslavia.\n\n   It is with the thieves themselves, with the Palestinian police\nwho do not crack down on thieves, and with the Israeli officials\nwho do not pressure them on this issue.\n\n   Theft of cars and of agricultural products, from tractors to\nbees, increased sharply after the Palestinians started taking\ncontrol of territory in the West Bank. Palestinian thieves became\nable to disappear into Palestinian-ruled land without fear of\napprehension. A lot of the thievery involves collaboration between\nIsraeli and Palestinian criminals, the authorities say.\n\n   ``The issue of theft is one of cooperation,'' said Samir Mouadi,\nIsrael's deputy agriculture minister for the West Bank. ``But it is\nthe cooperation of negative elements on both sides.''\n\n   Car theft was attacked by a joint operation of Israeli and\nPalestinian police. So far, though, hives have been largely\nignored, even though some government officials understand the\nprimacy of the bee.\n\n   Israeli agriculture officials estimate that 80 percent of the\nstolen hives made their way to the West Bank. That represents a\ndirect loss of only about $600,000 to the nation's beekeepers, who\ntend 80,000 hives. But, as Feldman says, ``the smallest bee is\nindeed a huge factory,'' and every hive contains thousands.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Feldman's bee-keeping venture is a typical Israeli story. It\nstarts in Odessa in 1882.\n\n   His great-great-grandfather was offered a deal he couldn't\nrefuse: the trade of a farm in what later became Nes Tziona,\nIsrael, for his place in Russia. The property was right near the\nWestern Wall in Jerusalem, he was falsely told. So after arriving\nat the desolate ruin of a farm in the middle of nowhere, he\nimmediately turned around and returned to fetch 10 other religious\nfamilies so he could be ensured of a prayer quorum, or minyan.\n\n   They started Israel's honey industry, whose history is soon to\nbe honored in a bee-keeping museum near Feldman's home in Nes\nTziona. The new immigrants were shown their first hives when they\nasked locals about the boxes bumping on the sides of their camels.\nAnd the rest is apiary history, despite the fact that Feldman's\ngreat-great-grandfather quickly discovered he was allergic to bees.\n\n   ``I always say that I believe I was actually conceived among bee\nhives,'' Feldman said. ``And that from age zero, I grew up chasing\nbees. I'm a Jew, so bees are not my religion. But close. If I'm not\nstung several times a day, I don't feel alive.''\n\n   Feldman contends out that bee-keepers are ``high-quality''\nIsraelis, many of whom served in elite units of the army. Indeed,\nthe lore of the beekeeper, in ancient times or pioneering days,\ninfests Israeli literature.\n\n   nn\n\n   One recent example is the bee-keeping protagonist in ``The Blue\nMountain,'' by Meir Shalev, an endearing character who calls his\nwife ``the queen bee.''\n\n   When a small-time beekeeper was wiped out by theft in December,\nFeldman, who owns about 1,500 hives, was radicalized, he said. He\nis right-wing, and skeptical about peace, but most of the other\nbeekeepers live in the farming collectives and kibbutzim belong to\nthe dovish Labor Party. Still, they think the government is\nsacrificing their livelihood on the altar of peace _ unwilling to\nmake a fuss.\n\n   The Jerusalem Post supported the bee-keepers in an editorial\nlast Friday.\n\n   ``Halt unneighborly theft,'' it said. ``Addressing the plague of\nagricultural theft does not conflict with the peace process. It is\npart of the more fundamental process of learning to live together\nas neighbors.''\n\n   In the deserted woods of Bet Jamal near Bet Shemesh in Israel,\nFeldman, his son, his son-in-law and a Palestinian worker recently\nvisited some of their hives. They all donned gear from head to toe\nbefore they lifted the honeycombs from their wooden boxes, checking\nto make sure the queen bee was still buzzing and that the others\nwere swarming and healthy.\n\n   In contrast, the Palestinian beekeepers in this West Bank town,\nmany of whom keep their hives in their backyards, visited their\nbees without any protective clothing whatsoever. ``We Palestinians\nare not afraid of the landmines all around us,'' Arafat said. ``Why\nshould we be afraid of little bees?''\n\n   To sit in a living room here with the Tulkarm Beekeepers\nAssociation, beneath a chandelier whose amber crystals look like\ndripping honey, is to absorb an incredible passion for an ancient\nlivelihood.\n\n   Arafat's best student, Adnan Hanoun, 37, keeps a sample of an\nold-fashioned mud hive in his workshop on Paris Street. But it is a\npiece of history, only. High-tech has come to the honey business\neven here, where it is a fledgling industry of some 20,000 hives,\nand Arafat owns an artificial bee insemination machine.\n\n   Hanoun's connection began during the Gulf War, after he had\ngraduated from Bir Zeit University near Ramallah with a degree in\nbusiness administration. Locked in his town by Israeli\nhigh-security measures, he started reading a how-to guide on\nbee-keeping, then went on to train with Arafat and in France. He\nhas since surpassed his teacher in the amount of honey he can\nextract from a hive.\n\n   At a time when their businesses, which produce mostly for local\nconsumption, are getting off the ground, the Palestinian beekeepers\nfeel stung by the thievery issue.\n\n   ``To be frank, we as Palestinian bee producers are hurt doubly,\nmaybe even more than the Israelis victims,'' Hanoun said. ``First,\nbecause we cannot compete with the stolen product. Second, because\nwe are suspect.''\n\n   The Palestinians said they were thrilled by the Israeli seminar,\noffered in the midst of this controversy. While some Israeli\nbeekeepers protested outside, they bonded with others inside, they\nsaid, trading notes on bee nutrition and bee medicine.\n\n   ``There was no need for a common language,'' Arafat said. ``The\ncommon language was the language of bees.''\n","Headline":"\nAMONG MIDEAST BARRIERS, THE TINIEST OF PASSIONS: THE BEE \n","Text":["\n   TULKARM, West Bank _ There is a quiet cult of the bee in the\nland of milk and honey, and beekeepers, be they Israeli or\nPalestinian, are the high priests of the hive.\n","\n   It was only a matter of time, then, in a place where passion and\nconflict are so entwined, before the bees of the Holy Land became\nensnared in the tangled web of the peace process.\n","\n   ``No bees, no peace,'' read the Hebrew placards at a recent\ndemonstration at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank, protesting\nan epidemic of hive thefts by Palestinians.
