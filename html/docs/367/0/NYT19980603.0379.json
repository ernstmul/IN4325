Times News Service  \n \n\n   PALMA, Majorca _ After sunset on a balmy evening in May,\nSalvatore Paradore prepared for another profitable night's fishing\nand launched his huge nets from the stern of the B. Colleoni into\nthe Mediterranean. There was no wind, little moonlight and no doubt\nin the mind of the Italian skipper that soon he would haul in\nplenty of swordfish and tuna.\n\n   But luck ran out for the trawler from Sicily.\n\n   At the crack of dawn, a Spanish Navy vessel pulled alongside,\ndetained the trawler and escorted it to a Spanish port. Paradore\nand his crew were held in custody aboard their vessel and accused\nof using illegal drift nets. Their gear and fish were confiscated.\n\n   The Spanish authorities said the boat was one of hundreds still\nusing enormous drift nets although nets longer than 1.5 miles are\nbanned worldwide because of their devastating effect on marine\necology.\n\n   Set out at night, the nets form a nylon wall in the water\nanywhere from 2 to 20 miles long and up to 50 feet deep, and allow\na small crew to harvest tons of fish. But scientists and government\nofficials have called the nets ``walls of death'' because they trap\nmany species the fishermen do not want and every year kill\nthousands of seabirds and protected creatures like seals, dolphins\nand whales.\n\n   The United States led a drive in the United Nations to ban the\nlarge drift nets and applied enormous pressure on Asian users,\nmainly Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, until they agreed to give\nthem up. The ban took effect on June 30, 1992. But six years later\nthe practice continues in much of the Mediterranean and parts of\nthe Atlantic Ocean.\n\n   ``Those nets are a menace, not just for the animals but also for\nthe other boats that can't see them,'' said Jaime Grimalt, director\nof fisheries on the island of Majorca. Spain abolished its own\ndrift nets but foreign trawlers often come into the rich fishing\ngrounds off the Balearic Islands, which at this time of year are\nbrimming with yachts and sports fishermen.\n\n   ``Boatmen are scared because those nets cause a lot of\naccidents,'' Grimalt said. ``Propellers get tangled up in them and\nthen boats have to be towed ashore.''\n\n   The capture of the B. Colleoni on May 17 and of a second Italian\nboat in Spanish waters on May 20 has drawn attention to the\ncontinuing defiance of the ban.\n\n   By law, the U.S. government must apply trade sanctions against\ncountries using the banned nets. For the last three years, the\nState and Commerce departments have quietly put pressure on Italy\nbut have preferred to avoid a confrontation that could mean a\nboycott of fish-related Italian exports. A State Department\nfisheries expert said that Italy had plans to scrap the illegal\nnets and that there had not been enough ``credible evidence'' to\nrecommend sanctions.\n\n   European Union officials say Italy is by far the worst offender\nagainst the U.N. ban, which also became law in the European Union.\nItaly has some 650 trawlers using drift nets, they say, many of\nthem of illegal length. Every summer for the last decade the\ntrawlers have fanned out across the Mediterranean to hunt for the\nprofitable swordfish and bluefin tuna.\n\n   More than 100 boats from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with\nillegal nets plow the rich fishing grounds off North Africa,\nalthough the governments deny this. About a dozen vessels from\nBritain and Ireland and about 40 from France use drift nets of both\nlegal and illegal length in the Atlantic, European Union officials\nsay.\n\n   The main problem, they say, is that many boat owners can ignore\nthe 1.5-mile limit on nets because government monitoring is poor.\nAnd plans of several governments to scrap the nets, convert the\nvessels and pension off the oldest fishermen have been slow to be\ncarried out.\n\n   As a result, several European governments now want all drift\nnets banned, even the short, legal kind. But France, Italy and\nIreland have been trying to block the move. Fisheries Ministers of\n15 European countries are expected to discuss the issue on June 8.\n\n   ``We see these nets as such a threat to the fish stock and the\nmarine mammals that we have proposed a total ban,'' Filippo di\nRobilant, spokesman for the European Commissioner for Fisheries in\nBrussels, said, adding that some nets still in use were up to 20\nmiles long. ``We have to decide now if we want rules to conserve\nour resources or if we want the law of the jungle.''\n\n     \nnn\n\n   This kind of argument angers Paradore and his five-man crew from\nMessina, Sicily, who were intercepted in Spanish waters and\ndetained in the port of Palma. Aboard their 75-foot vessel, they\nsaid they were waiting for a bank transfer to pay the bail of close\nto $27,500. Spanish authorities who confiscated the boat's nets\nsaid they were close to five miles long, three times the permitted\nsize.\n\n   Paradore said he had cut the five-mile net into three, each one\nof a legal size, but Spanish authorities said this trick was not\nacceptable. Pacing the deck and venting his frustrations, the\nskipper went on:\n\n   ``We worked like crazy, and now we are ruined. Fishing is one of\nthe oldest professions. Now it's suddenly a crime. It's not drift\nnets that ruin the sea. It's the industries and the cities with\ntheir pollution.''\n\n   The fishermen showed disdain for people who fussed about\nendangered animals like dolphins. ``There are thousands of dolphins\neverywhere,'' Paradore said. ``They are the plague of the fishermen\nbecause they eat all the fish.''\n\n   Experts say they do not know how many turtles, seals or\ncetaceans like whales, dolphins and porpoises live in the\nMediterranean or what proportion are killed. Biologists who record\nlarge animals washed ashore say that in the western part of the sea\nthey find several hundred a year, often with pieces of nets still\ncaught over their heads or tails. The mammals that need to come up\nfor air are most vulnerable.\n\n   ``Once they get entangled, they can easily drown,'' said\nAssumpta Gual, a biologist who has monitored fishing for\nGreenpeace, the environmental organization.\n\n   More is known about the Bay of Biscay, a coveted fishing ground\nin the Atlantic. The French government ordered a study of the\nimpact of about 40 French vessels that were using drift nets four\nto eight miles long. Observers found that between June and\nSeptember of 1993 the vessels caught 85 percent albacore tuna,\nwhich was their target species. Their unwanted catch included 1,700\ndolphins and 80,000 blue sharks.\n\n   Loic Antoine, a government biologist who took part in the study,\nsaid the dolphins killed represented about 1.5 percent of the\narea's dolphins. ``That is not a high mortality rate,'' he said.\n\n   Those results are one reason why the French government is\nagainst the European proposal to ban even short drift nets for the\nFrench vessels. ``They represent about 1,000 jobs,'' he said.\n\n   In Italy, many more jobs are at stake. Giuseppe Ambrosio,\ndirector of fisheries in Rome, said that about two-thirds of\nItalian boat owners using drift nets had said they would be willing\nto convert to different technology with the help of government\ngrants. The program has been discussed for several years, but has\nnot yet started.\n\n   Ambrosio conceded that overfishing of swordfish was indeed a\nproblem. But he said Italian violations of the drift-net ban were\nfew because the government was inspecting the boats. This\ncontrasted starkly with reports from Greenpeace, which used\nsurveillance aircraft and ships during its most recent campaign\nagainst drift netting and in May reported 14 Italian vessels using\nillegal nets to Italy's port authorities.\n\n   As the region's fishermen come under pressure, a new problem may\nloom. European Union officials are following tips that Spanish\nfishermen have sold their banned nets to Moroccans. And they are\ninvestigating reports that Italian skippers are applying for\nlicenses in Albania and Croatia.\n","Headline":"\nFISHERMEN BALK AT BAN ON LONG NETS\n","Text":["\n   PALMA, Majorca _ After sunset on a balmy evening in May,\nSalvatore Paradore prepared for another profitable night's fishing\nand launched his huge nets from the stern of the B.
