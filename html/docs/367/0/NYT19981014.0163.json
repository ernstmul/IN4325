Times News Service clients)  \n By BOB FENSTER  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   UNDATED - Two out-of-work actors face the thespian's nightmare:\nhaving to get a real job. Their plight sets off a chain of\nsilliness in ``The Impostors,'' a throwback comedy that attempts to\nreinvent the theatrical farce _ and mostly succeeds.\n\n   ``The Impostors'' is set in the 1930s but is approached with a\n'90s sensibility, which works to amusing effect in all but two\nglaring instances.\n\n   Arthur (Stanley Tucci) and Maurice (Oliver Platt) are two\nbumbling actors who stumble from one mishap to the next, eventually\nlanding on an ocean liner as accidental stowaways.\n\n   While Maurice and Arthur try to escape from a mad British ham\n(Alfred Molina) who wants their hides, they bump around a ship full\nof fools, con artists, femmes fatales and revolutionaries.\n\n   Written and directed by Tucci, ``The Impostors'' begins as a\nwarmhearted comedy, much like his first delight, ``Big Night.''\n\n   But then ``The Impostors'' veers off into farcical realms. The\nmovie gets sillier and sillier, until it's a full-blown,\nin-one-door-and-out-the-other kind of farce, all told with a rush\nof slapstick and flip repartee.\n\n   A surprising cast of supporting players includes a couple of\ncameos I won't give away here and some unexpected character actors\nhaving fun: Steve Buscemi (``Armageddon'') as a suicidal lounge\nsinger, Hope Davis (``Next Stop Wonderland'') as a mournful\nromantic, Campbell Scott (``TheSpanish Prisoner'') as an overwound\nship steward, and Billy Connolly (``Mrs. Brown'') as an athlete who\nis too much of a man's man.\n\n   They all take turns carrying the comic load, while Tucci and\nPlatt (``Bulworth'') transform themselves into a '90s version of\nLaurel and Hardy.\n\n   As a hangdog comic, Tucci is impeccable. But as writer and\ndirector, he slips twice:\n\n   (1) He throws in too much anachronistic cursing, which is\nunnecessary to the comedy.\n\n   (2) He lets the sexual situations slip from the risque into the\nraunchy.\n\n   Since ``The Impostors'' is a comic throwback to Hope/Crosby road\npicture nonsense, seniors are potentially a large part of the\naudience.\n\n   People who would appreciate the amusing virtues of an\nold-fashioned farce would probably find the R-rated movie funnier\nif it had not resorted to profanity and over-the-line sexuality.\n\n   Still, if you enjoyed the elevated nonsense of ``Radioland\nMurders'' and ``The Hudsucker Proxy,'' don't miss ``The\nImpostors.'' 3 stars.   \n  \n","Headline":"\nTUCCI HAS THE TOUCH FOR COMEDY IN `IMPOSTORS' \n","Text":["\n   UNDATED - Two out-of-work actors face the thespian's nightmare:\nhaving to get a real job.
