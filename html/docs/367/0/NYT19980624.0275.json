Times News Service   \n\n   Web Surf With Disney   \n\n   Disney Online, a three-year-old unit intent on bringing all the\nfluff and pink that is Disney to cyberspace, Wednesday opened\nDisney's Internet Guide, a Web search and directory site for\nchildren and families.\n\n   Dubbed Dig (www.dig.com), the new site is designed to compete\nwith Yahooligans, Yahoo's popular kids' directory. And in a sign\nthat the company is wasting no time capitalizing on its new\npartnership with Infoseek, the site will also soon serve as the\nkids' directory on Infoseek.\n\n   Like Yahooligans, Dig contains eight wholesome categories, like\nAnimals and the Outdoors, Stories and Comics, Games and Toys, and\nArts and Entertainment. Each of the Dig categories, which,\naccording to the company, ``collectively represent what Disney\nOnline considers to be the best of the Web for kids and families,''\nhave been picked by Dig team members and will be reviewed every few\ndays.\n\n   ``It really comes back to our overall Disney Online mission, to\nprovide a gateway to the Internet,'' said the president of Disney\nOnline, Richard Wolpert. Wolpert said Disney Online had been\nworking on development of the new site for a year.\n\n   Disney Online has lagged behind its competition. According to a\nrankings list maintained by Media Metrix, Disney Online barely\nregisters among the top 20 Web sites.\n\n   The new partnership with Infoseek, in which Disney acquired a 43\npercent stake in Infoseek, is expected to help, but analysts are\nskeptical of Disney's overall prospects of displacing others as a\nso-called portal site _ the Web site Internet users see when they\nfirst log on.\n\n   ``If you're using Yahoo now, particularly if you're an adult,\nthere's no way you're going to switch to Infoseek and Disney, not\nin this life,'' said Keith Benjamin, an Internet analyst with\nBancAmerica Robertson Stephens.   \n  \n\n   A link to the new site will also be available on the Disney home\npage (www.disney.com). Dig is Disney's fourth Web site. In addition\nto Disney.com, the company maintains Family.com and Disney's Blast\nOnline, a paid subscription service for children.   \n  \n\n   On-Line Medical Aid for China   \n  \n\n   Timed to coincide with President Clinton's visit to China this\nweek, American and Chinese doctors plan to perform a live\nconsultation over the Internet Thursday night to discuss two\nseverely ill children in China. It will be the first real-time\nmedical consultation between China and the United States over the\nInternet.\n\n   The event is less a practical medical move than a show of\ndiplomacy. Members of the Clinton Cabinet are expected to be on\nhand with doctors at the Medical University in Xian, a city in\ncentral China, as they consult pediatricians at the Lucile Packard\nChildren's Hospital at Stanford University about a 12-year-old girl\nwith inflammation of the heart and a newborn with brain damage.\n\n   The consultation will take place using standard Internet tools\nfor audio and video, as well as a ``white board'' feature that\nenables participants to share text, images and sketches.\n\n   ``When there's direct interplay, you get more from it,'' said\nDr. David Teitel, chief of pediatric cardiology at the University\nof California at San Francisco, who will be participating. ``They\ncan respond, and you can respond more quickly.''\n\n   There have been other experiments with telemedicine in China,\nrelying mainly on e-mail among doctors. Several hospitals in China,\nincluding Peking Union Medical College Hospital, have acquired\nsophisticated video-based teleconferencing systems, but such\nsystems are not available for the rest of China's population.\n\n   ``Everyone in the world has satellite links to Beijing, which is\nnot a very real test of medicine to China,'' said John Reuling,\ndirector of information technologies at Stanford University's\nSchool of Medicine. Reuling said the group had chosen to use widely\navailable Internet tools rather than state-of-the-art\nvideo-conferencing systems because they wanted to focus on what was\nactually available to doctors in Chinese cities outside the\ncapital.\n\n   High-performance computers provided by Sun Microsystems will be\nleft in Xian so further exchanges between doctors from both\ncountries can take place. The consultation was organized by Bridge\nto Asia, a nonprofit group.   \n  \n\n   nn\n\n   Popular Target: Family Trees\n\n   The Web is an obvious destination for the genealogically\ninclined, and its popularity among family tree makers was\nunderscored earlier this week when AT&T released the results of a\nsurvey: nearly one-third of those responding said they had used the\nInternet to seek family roots.\n\n   In a survey of more than 5,400 AT&T Worldnet Service\nsubscribers, one out of every 12 respondents said they had a\nfamily-tree Web page. Of those who did not, nearly 70 percent said\nthey would like to create one.\n\n   April Helm of Savoy, Ill., a professional genealogist who, with\nher husband, Matthew, maintains several Web sites on genealogy,\npointed to the convenience of the Web as the principal reason for\nthe explosion in interest in genealogy.\n\n   ``People are finding the Internet is a good tool for researching\ntheir family because it saves them from having to leave their house\nto find records,'' Ms. Helm said.\n\n   At the same time that AT&T released its survey, it announced a\ngenealogy page on the AT&T Worldnet Service Web site\n(www.att.net/find/ genealogy). The AT&T Genealogy Page features\nlinks to genealogy resources and family-tree software. The company\nhas hired the Helmses as its resident genealogy experts.   \n  \n\n   New Crackdown on Piracy   \n  \n\n   To fight software piracy, long the bane of the industry, the\nSoftware Publishers Association plans to get tough by pressing\ncharges more often and publicizing a rogues' gallery.\n\n   A report released last week by the association and the Business\nSoftware Alliance showed that in 1997, the industry lost $11.4\nbillion worldwide to producers of illegal copies of business\nsoftware applications.\n\n   Four in every 10 copies of business applications are bootlegged\nversions, according to the report. The number does not include\nsoftware for general consumer use.\n\n   Until now, the association has settled about 90 percent of cases\nwith fines and confidentiality agreements. But leniency apparently\nhasn't worked. ``There has to be zero tolerance when it comes to\nsoftware piracy,'' said David Phelps, an association spokesman.\n\n   Some countries have improved, the report says. Five years ago in\nEurope, 9 out of 10 software programs were pirated, but that number\nhas dropped to 5 out of 10. Piracy is worst in Bulgaria, China,\nIndonesia and Vietnam.   \n  \n\n   SELECTIVE SCREEN Just what the Web needs _ another filtering\nprogram. But this two-in-one product looks like a good one. SOS\nKidproof, from Sterling Strategic Solutions, filters inappropriate\nWeb sites and protects PCs from accidental or intentional\ntampering. And the company says it can distinguish between a Web\nsite containing ``breast of duck'' and one with questionable\npictures. The $29.95 package is expected to be in retail stores\nnext month.   \n  \n\n   MAKING ROOM ON LINE According to a report issued jointly earlier\nthis week by two research outfits, International Data Corp. and\nRelevant Knowledge, the number of home Web users in the United\nStates will increase to nearly 102 million by 2002 from roughly 30\nmillion.\n\n   IDC reports that the percentage of those users who purchase\nitems on line will grow to almost 50 percent from 36 percent, with\noverall spending increasing to more than $54 billion in 2002 from\n$4.3 billion in 1997.   \n  \n\n   SHOP TALK Speaking of shopping, Compare.net (www.compare.net),\nthe online shopping guide, announced deals with Classifieds 2000\nand Deja News, the Internet discussion group search and archive\nservice, to allow its shoppers to search classified ads and get\naccess to discussion groups for peer opinions on products like\nwashing machines and used Corvettes.  \n","Headline":"\nNEWS ON COMPUTERS \n","Text":["\n   Web Surf With Disney   \n","\n   Disney Online, a three-year-old unit intent on bringing all the\nfluff and pink that is Disney to cyberspace, Wednesday opened\nDisney's Internet Guide, a Web search and directory site for\nchildren and families.\n","\n   Dubbed Dig (www.dig.com), the new site is designed to compete\nwith Yahooligans, Yahoo's popular kids' directory.
