Times News Service    \n\n   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Lars Sjoberg dates his obsession with old\nSwedish houses to 1951, when, at age 10, his mother gave him a book\nfrom his grandfather's library on manors and villas from centuries\npast.\n\n   ``For two years after that, I was always drawing houses and\nmaking models of them,'' he said. ``And some looked like the\nearliest and smallest of the six I own today, a red timber house\ncalled Sorby in a tiny village of that name.''\n\n   Built like an American log cabin in the 17th century, Sorby,\nabout 130 miles southwest of here, was updated a century later to\nlook like a manor house: the windows were enlarged and the grass\nroof replaced by a mansard roof, with small glass panes in the\nshort wall between the two levels, to admit light into the attic.\n``In some ways it's my favorite house,'' Sjoberg said.\n\n   Some people collect Hula-Hoops, cookie jars, Japanese screens or\neven racing cars; Sjoberg collects houses. What began as a\nchildhood fancy became a reality when he needed places to live, and\nit evolved into a compulsion when he saw old houses about to be\ntorn down.\n\n   His passion to save houses is perhaps rooted in his father's\nbelief that he could make and repair most anything. His father\ntaught wood and metal crafting at the boarding school near\nStockholm that Lars Sjoberg and his two sisters attended and where\nthe family lived. ``He taught me that everything is possible for a\ncarpenter,'' Sjoberg said. ``I'm trying but not always\nsucceeding.''\n\n   When Sjoberg was a teen-ager, the family built a simple modern\nhouse near the school. ``Even then, I longed for something\nold-fashioned,'' he said.\n\n   His interest deepened when he studied art history and\narchitecture at Stockholm University. After he graduated in 1965\nand became an assistant curator of art at the National Museum, he\ngrew even more determined to make old houses part of his life. So\nhe and his bride, Ursula, also a budding art historian, began\nliving in a timber house on his family's property while they hunted\nfor an old manor house they could call home.\n\n   The first house Sjoberg bought, 35 years ago, was Regnaholm, a\nsplendid 18th-century white and yellow manor house that he now says\nwas too large, too expensive and too distant from Stockholm _ 120\nmiles southwest in Ostergotlund. But the house was facing\ndemolition, so he and his family pooled their resources and bought\nit as a vacation house. At the time, Swedish preservationists were\nnot yet protesting the razing of 18th-century buildings because, as\nSjoberg said, many still existed and preserving old houses seemed\nelitist to those campaigning for low-cost housing.\n\n   The couple searched for nine years before they found their\nperfect house, Odenslunda, a five-room manor house in Uppland, only\n18 miles from Stockholm. Built in 1775 for the military, it was,\nSjoberg said, ``the largest type made for a colonel.'' The house\nwas made of timbers, stone and bricks and covered with wooden\nvertical siding and had an attic.\n\n   Today, Sjoberg, 59, a senior curator at the museum, uses his\nhouses, built between 1680 and 1830, for his workshops on\narchitectural restoration, a program he conducts for Stockholm\nUniversity. In addition to manors, he owns an 18th-century\nItalianate villa, an 1830s country inn and an 1810 building that\nhoused the families of factory workers.\n\n   In the early '90s, Sjoberg was a consultant to Ikea and designed\na line of traditional Swedish furniture, lighting and accessories\nfor the chain. He has written several books on Swedish furniture;\nhis best-known work, ``The Swedish Room,'' a collaboration with\nSjoberg, who is now a curator of the Royal Collections, includes\nfour of their houses.\n\n   All of Sjoberg's houses reflect the French-influenced Gustavian\nstyle of the 18th century. The look was shaped in part by the\narchitect Carl Harleman, who had visited Versailles before\ndesigning the interiors of the Royal Palace in Stockholm. He\nbrought back to Sweden the mansard roof, tall narrow multipaned\nwindows, crystal chandeliers, pastel and white color schemes,\nneo-Classical furnishings, floral patterned fabrics and wallpapers\nand gilded rococo embellishments.\n\n   This style flourished in Swedish palaces and homes, and lives on\nin turn-of-the-century paintings by Carl Larsson and in the films\nof Ingmar Bergman. Lars Sjoberg is also reviving the style in the\nrooms of palaces he has decorated and the houses he has collected,\nusing techniques he learned from master craftsmen decades ago or\ndiscovered on his own or through teaching.\n\n   ``My students, all 20 of them, practice restoration,'' he said.\n``They are learning how to mix plaster and apply it thinly to the\nwalls the way they did in the 18th century.'' They also stucco\nceilings and dismantle and reassemble porcelain stoves to repair\nthem. The most difficult task, he says, is scraping layers of paint\nfrom walls, to get down to the original surfaces. ``You have to\nknow what you should look for _ not the raw wood, but the first\nlayer of paint,'' he said. ``And you have to know what to do with\nwhat you find: don't repaint the wall. Instead, when you strip off\nthe layers, leave the original painted surface, worn though it may\nseem.''\n\n   The secret to restoration, he said, often has more to do with\nwhat you remove than what you add. The windows at Regnaholm, he\nsays, still have the original glass panes. Nearly clear but lightly\ntinted green, they produce a wondrous light when left uncovered on\nsunny days.\n\n   ``And at Sorby, all the rooms still have the painted canvas wall\ndecoration, from 250 years ago, faded but intact,'' he said. ``The\nGustavian lightness is back again.''\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nA COLLECTOR WHOSE PASSION IS SAVING OLD HOUSES \n","Text":["\n   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ Lars Sjoberg dates his obsession with old\nSwedish houses to 1951, when, at age 10, his mother gave him a book\nfrom his grandfather's library on manors and villas from centuries\npast.\n","\n   ``For two years after that, I was always drawing houses and\nmaking models of them,'' he said. ``And some looked like the\nearliest and smallest of the six I own today, a red timber house\ncalled Sorby in a tiny village of that name.''\n","\n   Built like an American log cabin in the 17th century, Sorby,\nabout 130 miles southwest of here, was updated a century later to\nlook like a manor house: the windows were enlarged and the grass\nroof replaced by a mansard roof, with small glass panes in the\nshort wall between the two levels, to admit light into the attic.\n``In some ways it's my favorite house,'' Sjoberg said.\n","\n   Some people collect Hula-Hoops, cookie jars, Japanese screens or\neven racing cars; Sjoberg collects houses.
