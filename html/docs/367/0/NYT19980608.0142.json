Walter, in his 1947 recording of the entire symphony, does\nit in 7:35 minutes. Since then, conductors have stretched the\nAdagietto like warm taffy. Leonard Bernstein, in his 1987 reading\nwith the Vienna Philharmonic, jumps to an astonishing 11:13\nminutes.\n\n   And in 1973, Herbert von Karajan, in a remarkable act of\nself-communing bravura, elongated the movement to 11:53 minutes,\nproof of the Berlin Philharmonic's capacity for sustaining lengthy\nphrases but a subversion of the symphony's architecture.\n\n   It is Gilbert Kaplan, the renowned Mahler fan and auto-didact\nconductor, who comes closest to that first generation of\nMahlerians, dispatching the Adagietto in 7:53 minutes.\n\n   Now we know that performances of most Romantic music have slowed\ndown in the past century; and while audiences would likely reject\nsuch distentions in Beethoven, they seem not to object in Mahler.\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
