THINK 10-YEAR, TREASURY SAYS\n\n  (rk) \n By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   Since 1977, when the federal government began regularly issuing\n30-year bonds, they have been the benchmark of the American bond\nmarket. But Wednesday the Treasury signaled that those days should\nsoon be over.\n\n   In a move that could eventually eliminate the 30-year bond\naltogether, the Treasury Department announced plans for a reduction\nin new issuance of the bonds and the buying back of other long-term\nTreasury debt.\n\n   The department's under secretary for domestic finance, Gary\nGensler, said bond market investors were already starting to regard\nthe 10-year note as the benchmark. ``The focus,'' Gensler said,\n``is more and more on the 10-year note than on the 30-year bond.''\n\n   The changes the Treasury announced were forced by growing\nfederal budget surpluses, which have allowed the government to pay\noff some of the publicly held government debt, which now stands at\nabout $3.3 trillion. In this quarter, the Treasury expects to\nreduce the public debt by $17 billion followed by a record payoff\nof $152 billion in the second quarter.\n\n   The shift to the 10-year note as a benchmark had already begun\nbecause of its wide use as a pricing point in the corporate and\nmortgage markets. But the change has accelerated because of the\ndistortion in the performance of the 30-year bond since the\nTreasury first announced last month that it was going to buy back\nold Treasury securities. Since then the yield has fallen almost\nhalf a percentage point.\n\n   ``It would not surprise me if the Treasury phases out the\n30-year bond over the next several years,'' said Ward McCarthy,\nmanaging director at Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, N.J. ``It's\ntrading like it's a collectors' item.''\n\n   Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates,\nsaid the Treasury itself had hastened the shift from the 30-year\nbond by announcing the buybacks. The Treasury, he said, ``triggered\nthe event that has called into question the reliability'' of the\n30-year bond.\n\n   The Treasury said Wednesday that it would reduce the issuance of\nits 2-year, 5-year and 10-year notes and its 30-year bond. It will\nalso reduce the issuance of its 30-year inflation-indexed bond.\nTogether, the issuance of regular and inflation-indexed 30-year\nbonds will be less than half the $45 billion total in the fiscal\nyear 1999, which ended Sept. 30, 1999.\n\n   Accordingly, Crandall said that based on what has been issued so\nfar this fiscal year, the $10 billion in new 30-year bonds to be\nissued next week will be followed by about $5 billion in May. The\nMay figure is significantly less than the $10 billion many analysts\nexpected.\n\n   The Treasury also said it would reduce the issuance of one-year\nbills by cutting the schedule from every four weeks to four times a\nyear. Officials are also considering the elimination of the\none-year bill. At the same time, the Treasury will increase the\nsupply of three-month and six-month bills.\n\n   The reduction of longer-term debt issuance and the shift to more\nthree- and six-month bills will help lower the overall cost of\ngovernment borrowing, which is one of the Treasury's main goals.\n\n   The Treasury buybacks will start in the next two months. The\ninitial buybacks will be about $1 billion at a time. Gensler said\nthe buybacks would give the Treasury and investors the experience\nthey need before moving to larger buybacks. Investors are not\nrequired to sell their Treasury securities back to the Treasury, so\na premium price will have to be offered. The Treasury said it hoped\nto buy back up to $30 billion in longer-term securities by the end\nof 2000.\n\n   The announcement of the details of buying back long-term debt\nand the reduction of issuance of new 30-year bonds had a marked\neffect. The price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 27/32 to 97 29/32,\nwhile the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to\n6.28 percent, from 6.42 percent on Tuesday.\n\n   The yield on the 30-year bond is now not much higher than the\nyield on the one-year Treasury bill, which was at 6.19 percent\nWednesday. And it is lower than the yield on the Treasury's\ntwo-year note at 6.58 percent, the five-year note at 6.65 percent,\nand the 10-year note at 6.57 percent, down from 6.62 percent on\nTuesday.\n","Headline":"\n(ATTN: N.J.)  \n THAT 30-YEAR BENCHMARK?
