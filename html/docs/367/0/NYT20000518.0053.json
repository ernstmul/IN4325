Of the 270\nvictims murdered in the bombing of Pan Am 103, 70 percent were\nAmerican. Wednesday, President Clinton confirmed that agents of\nOsama bin Laden plotted last December to bomb large crowds of\nAmericans celebrating New Year's Eve. The State Department's\nconclusion that Americans are most at risk from terror groups\noperating out of the Middle East or South Asia must seem a grim\nstatement of the obvious to anyone who follows the news.\n\n   But not to Ali Abunimah. Writing on the op-ed page of The New\nYork Times last week, the vice president of the Arab American\nAction Network cited ``the government's own data'' to prove the\ngovernment wrong.\n\n   ``Of the 169 specifically anti-American attacks on foreign soil\nin 1999,'' Abunimah wrote, ``96 were in Latin America, 30 were in\nWestern Europe . . . nine in the . . . former Soviet Union, and 16\nin Africa. Only 11 were in the Middle East, and just six in Asia.''\nYet Latin American terrorists, he noted, ``get less attention than\ngroups with Arab or Muslim orientations.''\n\n   But there is good reason for the focus on Arab and Muslim\nterrorists: They pose by far the greatest danger to American life\nand limb.\n\n   Every terror attack is an outrage, but the most frightful are\nthe ones that result in casualties _ human beings killed and\nmaimed. It is true that many anti-American attacks occur in Latin\nAmerica. Hostages have been kidnapped for ransom; oil pipelines\nhave been bombed. But in very few of those attacks have any\nAmericans been hurt. Terrorism from the Middle East and South Asia,\nby contrast, is the terrorism that puts Americans in the hospital _\nor the grave.\n\n   Between 1993 and 1999, 67 US citizens were killed in\ninternational terrorist attacks, according to the State\nDepartment's annual chronologies. (Attacks by American\nperpetrators, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, are omitted.) Of\nthose victims, 87 percent were murdered by terrorists based in the\nMiddle East or South Asia. Over the same period, 1,299 Americans\nwere wounded in terrorist incidents. Fully 99 percent were attacked\nby terrorists from the Middle East or South Asia.\n\n   (It isn't only Americans who are threatened by these terrorists.\nAlmost 75 percent of all deaths attributed to international\nterrorism since 1993 were caused by groups from the Middle\nEast/South Asia. Those groups were likewise responsible for 87\npercent of all attacks that left victims wounded.)\n\n   But statistics are hardly necessary to prove that the terrorism\ndeadliest to Americans comes, in Abunimah's phrase, from ``groups\nwith Arab or Muslim orientations.'' Just run through the list of\nlethal attacks; invariably the butchers were Muslim and/or Arab.\nPan Am 103. The World Trade Center. The Marines in Beirut. The 19\nUS airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Leon Klinghoffer on the Achille\nLauro. Robbie Stethem, the Navy diver on TWA 847. The 12 Americans\n_ and 212 Africans _ blown up at the US embassies in Kenya and\nTanzania.\n\n   The only notable exception to this bloody list is Oklahoma City.\nYet, oddly enough, Oklahoma City was the one atrocity Abunimah\nmentioned in his column. Why? To make the claim that Arabs and\nMuslims ``have too often borne the brunt of government suspicion\nand media stereotyping,'' since in the first hours after the Murrah\nBuilding was bombed, there was some speculation that Islamic\nextremists might have been responsible.\n\n   Certainly unjust suspicion and stereotyping should be condemned.\n``Muslim'' and ``Arab'' are not synonyms for ``terrorist.'' But\ngiven the awful toll of victims killed and wounded by Muslim and\nArab terrorists, surely the vice president of the Arab American\nAction Network would want to denounce their crimes as vehemently as\npossible. Surely he would want to make it clear that Arabs and\nMuslims in America are horrified by terror committed by evil men\nclaiming to act for the sake of Islam or the Arab people.\n\n   But no. Abunimah says nothing at all about the Arab/Islamic\nterrorism that has shattered so many lives _ except to warn against\n``overreacting'' to it. If Abunimah is scandalized by the savagery\nof terror organizations like Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, or\nthe Osama Bin Laden network, he gives no hint of it.\n\n   In a much longer version of his essay that he disseminated\nonline, Abunimah disputes that Hezbollah is really guilty of\nterrorism, excuses Iran's support for terror groups, and says he is\n``deeply skeptical'' that Bin Laden is a terrorist mastermind. It\nis no surprise that he also holds that terrorism out of the\nArab/Muslim world is not that big a threat to Americans.\n\n   If only someone would tell the terrorists. ``To kill the\nAmericans and their allies, civilians, and military,'' proclaimed\nBin Laden in February 1998, ``is an individual duty for every\nMuslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do\nit.'' Six months later, the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es\nSalaam were blown to bits.\n\n   Â \n\n   Jeff Jacoby is a Globe columnist.\n","Headline":"\nTHE REAL TERRORIST THREAT \n","Text":["\n   ``The primary terrorist threats to the United States,'' reports\nthe State Department in its latest survey of global terrorism,\n``emanate from two regions, South Asia and the Middle East.''\n","\n   As if to underline the point, the trial of two Libyan agents\naccused of blowing up a jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988\nopened just two days after the new report was released.
