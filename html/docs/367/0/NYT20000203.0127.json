With his prep-school sartorial style and\nhis eager aura, he looks like he's selling chances for the senior\nclass raffle at, say, Deerfield Academy. But Robertson is pitching\nsomething else entirely. The CEO of the Internet start-up MP3.com\nis promising to drag the music business _ and anyone who will hear\nhis spiel _ into the digital age.\n\n   ``This is so cool,'' he begins, ``it's going to blow you away.''\nHe borrows a CD (the Foo Fighters's ``The Color and the Shape'')\nand pops it into my computer. One click of the mouse and _ voila! _\nthe music is instantly available in his on-line music account at\nMP3.com. He can listen to it on any computer with Internet access,\nany time, anywhere.\n\n   Yes, it's very cool, much faster and more readily accessible\nthan other systems that allow you to store digital music files\n(called MP3s) on line. You can also purchase CDs from on-line music\nvendors and receive a virtual copy in your MP3.com account days\nbefore the CD itself actually arrives on your doorstep. Here's how\nit works: MP3.com has compiled a library of 45,000 CDs; when you\npurchase a CD or place your own CD into the system, it gives you\naccess to their digital copies.\n\n   But there's one little problem with the Foo Fighters episode.\nAnd what would that be, Mr. Robertson? ``It is piracy,'' Robertson,\n32, says, his usually determined voice rising to an almost\nevangelical roar. ``People are copying CDs like crazy out there.\nThe question is: How do you create a system that is as secure as\npossible?''\n\n   Indeed, that is the question (no doubt the Foo Fighters would\nagree). It's also the focus of a copyright infringement lawsuit\nfiled against MP3.com last week by the Recording Industry\nAssociation of America and the major record labels. For the past\nyear, the association has had litigation fever, trying to use the\ncourts to stop the inevitable spread of digital music distribution\nover the Internet. It hasn't had much luck, and legal experts\ncontend that the music industry group doesn't have much chance of\nwinning this latest lawsuit, either.\n\n   But this isn't just a case of the musclebound music industry\nbehemoths taking on the scrawny techno-geeks. (MP3.com went public\nlast year, and despite losses of $36 million in 1999, the company\nis worth almost $2 billion on the stock exchange.) The MP3.com\nsituation is brewing as the $40 billion music business is\nstruggling to redefine itself in the midst of unprecedented change.\nUpstarts like MP3.com are using new technologies to market and\ndistribute music on the Internet, tapping into territory recently\ncontrolled by the major record companies. At first, the majors\nattempted to stop the rate of change by suing these new start-ups,\nbut that hasn't worked. Now in addition to filing suit, the big\nguys are running around playing catchup, trying to figure out how\nto adapt to the technology revolution.\n\n   The Internet, in fact, is the driving force behind the recent\nmerger mania in the music business. The America Online-Time Warner\nmarriage is a no-brainer for the entertainment conglomerate, which\nwas flailing about trying to create a presence in cyberspace. Time\nWarner _ and its subsidiary, Warner Music _ can provide what's\ncalled ``content'' for AOL's subscription base. Likewise, Time\nWarner's recent marriage with EMI Group gives the combined company\na gigantic music catalogue _ as in, Madonna meets the Beach Boys.\nInternet companies are starving for content, and the two struggling\ncompanies are aiming to gain more clout by joining forces.\n\n   One former industry insider isn't impressed. ``They're just\ncircling their wagons,'' says Al Teller, a former record company\nexecutive who is founder of the Internet music start-up, Atomic\nPop. ``They can all combine into one big major, but this revolution\nis going to happen and they're not going to be able to control it.\nThey may control a huge catalogue, but they're never going to\ncontrol the individual artist.''\n\n   But if they're not ready to join the revolution, they can still\ntry to postpone it. ``There is a legitimate fear of piracy, but\nthere is also a fear of being rendered obsolete,'' says Mark\nLemley, a law professor at the University of California at\nBerkeley. ``They're afraid of being left out of the loop, and what\nthey should really be doing is coming up with their own ways of\ndistributing music on line.''\n\n   And MP3.com's ``very cool'' service may foreshadow be the future\nof the music industry. It's free    today   , but Robertson is hoping\nto turn it into a subscription service some day. Consumers will pay\nfor music the same way they pay for cable television, and as the\ntechnology develops, it will be ubiquitious. ``   Today    it's the PC,\nbut    tomorrow    it's your Palm Pilot, your cell phone, your watch,''\nhe says, holding his wristwatch to his ear like a digital Dick\nTracy.\n\n   In some ways, Robertson is a visionary: Former industry insiders\nwho have launched Internet music ventures agree that the old ways\nof music distribution (as in record stores) are doomed to become\nobsolete. But there's that little piracy problem. Marc Geiger, a\nfounder of Lollapalooza who is now CEO of the Internet start-up\nArtistdirect.com, has long championed the concept of a subscription\nservice like the one Robertson is offering. ``It's an exciting\nidea, but you can't just screw the artist. You can't just screw the\nindustry,'' he says.\n\n   But MP3.com has, in fact, taken some steps to prevent piracy.\nUsers can only listen to the music on a computer; they can't\ndownload it to a portable MP3 player. Also, all user accounts are\nprotected by passwords; no two users can listen to the same account\nat the same time. And you must either purchase a new CD or have an\nactual physical copy of one (as opposed to a computer file) to add\nthe music to your account. But we saw what happened with the Foo\nFighters CD, didn't we? What's to stop the kids in the dorm from\npassing one CD around to every room on the hall?\n\n   Nothing, answers Robertson. That's not his problem. ``Piracy\nhappens all the time.'' And he operates at Internet speed: He's not\nabout to wait for the plodding recording industry to come up with\nsome failproof security system to protect artists. ``We are\nbuilding the railroad system to run the music,'' he says. ``We\ndon't own the music. We don't own the rights.''\n\n   That's precisely the recording industry's point. But legal\nexperts contend that the industry would have to sue all the\nindividuals who violate the copyright law, not the company that\nprovides the conduit to make it possible. ``These lawsuits are\nfutile,'' says Lemley. ``They're not going to stop the music from\ngoing on line.''\n\n   And that's the dilemma. Everybody's right, and everybody's\nwrong. Companies like MP3.com (and another fledgling start-up\ncalled Napster.com) are forcing change by launching music\ndistribution systems that challenge the status quo, yet they're not\nexactly protecting artists' rights, despite their protestations to\nthe contrary. And the record industry folks say they are the\nchampions of artists' rights, even as they use whatever means\npossible to protect the power that enables them to milk profits out\nof the artists they represent.\n\n   Does this sound like an industry in need of an overhaul? You\nbet. But the only thing certain is that change is inevitable.\n``There will be events that push this revolution forward, and some\nof them of them are going to be ugly,'' says Geiger. So what's the\nmotto of this revolution? Liberty, egality, piracy?
