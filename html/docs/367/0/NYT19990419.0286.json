Times News Service   \n\n   Until last summer, my hometown of Louisville, Ky., was better\nknown for horse racing and baseball bats than the genteel sport of\nsculling. Then, a 35-year-old Louisvillian named Tori Murden set\nout from the North Carolina coast in a 23-foot boat with the hope\nof becoming the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n   A former collegiate sculler, Ms. Murden rowed for 85 days and\nwas two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic when Hurricane\nDanielle forced her to give up. Even though she did not make it,\nLouisville was suddenly talking about sculling.\n\n   I have decided that I would like to try this sport, which Ms.\nMurden had described in interviews as having a mystical allure as\nwell as physical benefits. When I telephone her, she tells me about\nthe Florida Rowing Center on Lake Wellington, near West Palm Beach,\nwhere she is planning to brush up on her own skills, so I sign up\nfor a weekend sculling class for novices.\n\n   Friday's session begins at 7:30 a.m., as the mist burns off the\n150-acre lake, revealing a mirror-smooth surface. On the pier,\npelicans ruffle their feathers and regard us in silence. The rowing\ncenter, little more than a trailer and a fleet of 30 boats, was\nfounded by a retired justice of the New York Supreme Court, Arnold\nGuy Fraiman, who switched from marathons to rowing out of\nconsideration for his arthritic knees.\n\n   I am in my early 40s, but the instructor, Todd Haynes, says that\nmany people take up sculling in mid-life. His oldest student, he\nsays, was 92. I am relieved to hear this, since my exercise regimen\nhad been a sort of fitness lite, involving twice-weekly workouts\nwith free weights and leisurely spins on the stationary bike at the\ngym. Occasionally, I would switch to the rowing machine, but found\nit terminally boring.\n\n   Unlike sweep rowing, in which each crew member is responsible\nfor a single oar on either side of the boat, sculling involves\nrowing with two oars. Although there are two- and four-person\nboats, sculling is most often a solitary pursuit.\n\n   Almost anyone can learn to row, Todd assures us. All that is\nrequired is the ability to swim in case the boat tips over, a\ncommon experience for beginners. There are three important rules to\nsculling, he adds: relax, relax and relax.\n\n   This is not easy. From afar, the boats look sturdy. But when I\nsidle up to one of them and try to figure out how to get in, I\nrealize the narrow boats are extremely unstable. Relaxing in one is\nlike trying to relax while sitting on a floating log.\n\n   Todd assigns me one of the more forgiving boats. Still, it is\nmore than 21 feet long and only 19 inches across at the waterline,\ntapering to a point at each end. I am supposed to steer the thing\nwith two nine-foot-long sculls, as the oars are called.\n\n   Once in the boat, I sit on a sliding seat, facing the stern.\nThis means I will be rowing with my back to my destination and\nturning to look over my shoulder after every few strokes. Lifting\none oar handle, even slightly, causes the boat to dip precariously\nto the opposite side; lift the other and suddenly it tilts the\nother way. Take a stroke with the right oar, and the boat veers to\nthe left.\n\n   Another surprise: the sculler's legs, not her arms, supply most\nof the power. During a stroke, scullers move their blades backwards\nover the water, while sliding the seat toward the stern until they\nare in a sort of crouch, then drop the blades in and push hard with\nthe legs. Straightening the legs, then leaning back and pulling\nwith the arms forces the blades through the water, propelling the\nboat. This explains why rowing provides a superb workout; it uses\nall the major muscle groups: arms, legs, trunk and back.\n\n   Scullers also use subtle shifts of the hands to turn the blades\nparallel and perpendicular to the water at different points in the\nstroke. Learning to synchronize all the movements to create a\nsmooth, graceful motion can take months of practice.\n\n   Todd fusses over my grip, placing my thumbs on the ends of the\nhandles, and separating my fingers so that my grip seems absurdly\nloose. Beginners naturally grip the oars tightly, struggling to\nforce the boat to balance. It seems counterintuitive, but a\ndelicate grip is better for balancing a wobbly boat.\n\n   Experimenting, I discover this is true. The boat is very\nunsteady, but responds to the slightest movements of my hands.\n\n   In the next hour, Todd and two other instructors circle the lake\nin motorboats, videotaping students and dispensing advice.\n\n   nn\n\n   ``Look at your hands,'' Todd calls to me. Glancing down, I am\nsurprised to see that I still have a death grip on the oars.\nOffering a Zenlike pronouncement, he reminds me, ``Less is more.''\n\n   ``Also,'' he says, ``stop watching the oars. Your eyesight is\nthe very last sense you need. Try rowing several strokes with your\neyes closed.''\n\n   I am skeptical, but soon I am balancing the boat solely by feel,\nand sensing the action of my oars by their sound alone.\n\n   After breakfast, the coaches use the videotape to critique our\nperformances. The camera does not lie. I am holding on to the oars\nfor dear life. Todd repeats, ``Less is more.''\n\n   After some stretching exercises to prevent soreness, we are back\non the water, and I find I have a new incentive to loosen my grip\non the oars: four nasty blisters on my hands. Novice rowers, it\nturns out, go through a lot of Band-Aids.\n\n   The next day, my blisters are so tender I cannot help but hold\nthe oars properly. I have graduated to a boat that is narrower,\nfaster and less forgiving, but after more practice and another\ncritique, I feel increasingly comfortable on the water.\n\n   By Saturday afternoon, I transfer into an even narrower and,\ntherefore, faster, boat, a mere 10 inches across at the waterline.\nThe wind whips up, and the oars make a scuffing sound as each\nstroke sends the boat zipping across the water's corrugated\nsurface.\n\n   Across the lake, Tori Murden whizzes past with near-perfect\nform, and gives me an appreciative nod. I close my eyes and listen\nto the whooshing of the seat, its rhythm like breathing. I\nconcentrate on the splash of my oars, the satisfying tug on my\nblades. I am putting together more and more good strokes.\n\n   I look up. A pelican glides overhead, its wings a perfect\nimitation of my oars. I push harder, thinking that this must be the\nmost sensuous sport in the world. I am the bird, I am the boat, I\nam flying, I am ... suddenly leaning way over to the left, then way\nover to the right, then farther to the left, then farther to the\nright, then dumped into the water.\n\n   I am still not sure what happened, though I suspect it had to do\nwith forgetting that ``less is more.''\n\n   Still, by the end of my stay on Sunday afternoon, I am\ncomfortable in the narrowest boats. I leave pleasantly exhausted,\nwith that scrubbed-all-over feeling that comes from spending hours\non the water in the wind and sun.\n\n   Back home, I make no plans to row across any oceans, but I do go\nout on the river every chance I get. On days when I cannot, I use\nthe rowing machine. And if I close my eyes and remember to relax, I\ncan almost look up and see wings.   \n  \n\n   ---   \n  \n\n   Sculling lessons are offered around the country at different\ntimes of the year.
