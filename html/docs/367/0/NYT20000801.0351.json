Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Philharmonic's courtship of the conductor Riccardo\nMuti has ended, amicably, it appears, but with no success. It had\nbeen no secret that the orchestra was hoping to entice the\nperfectionist Italian maestro to take over the music director's\npost when Kurt Masur steps down in 2002. But Muti, who has a sure\nsense of his own desirability, was playing hard to get. He was\nessentially unwilling to scale back his European commitments,\nespecially as the artistic generalissimo of La Scala.\n\n   Fortunately, the Philharmonic decided that for all Muti's\nbrilliance and renown, the orchestra needed a full-time music\ndirector. Whatever one may say about the strengths and shortcomings\nMasur has brought to the job, no one has ever questioned his\ndevotion to the New York Philharmonic.\n\n   Now the orchestra must restart its search. And with major music\ndirector posts also up for grabs in Philadelphia and Boston, the\nprocess will not be easy.\n\n   Conductors these days frequently have relationships with several\norchestras at once. Still, that the Philharmonic was interested in\nsomeone, however illustrious, who indicated from the start that he\nwould treat this important directorship as only one of several\ndemanding posts says a lot, some of it troubling, about how the\norchestra views the job. What can be learned from what happened?\nHow might the orchestra adjust its thinking?\n\n   A music director's job has two major components, especially in\nan international music center like New York. Obviously, the\nPhilharmonic must have a brilliantly skilled and musically\ntop-notch conductor, the kind of probing interpreter who can keep\nthe players involved, especially in the standard repertory that\naudiences want to hear regularly. And if the candidate already has\na well-known name and an extensive discography, as Muti does, that\nobviously makes the marketing department happy.\n\n   But a music director in a big city should also be a dynamic\nartistic leader, someone who can forge ties with other performing\nand educational institutions, someone on close terms with living\ncomposers, an adventurous musician who treats performing new music\nnot as some weighty obligation but as a bracing activity, a natural\npart of what musicians do.\n\n   I have long felt that orchestras, especially in America, place\ntoo much emphasis on the brilliant conductor aspect of the music\ndirector job, when what is crucially needed are vibrant artistic\nleaders. Perhaps because America is still nursing a cultural\ninferiority complex, orchestras keep going after foreign\nheavyweights and older eminences, passing over younger, energetic\nAmericans who could wake up a cultural community.\n\n   Why not have a younger, idealistic and preferably American\nartistic director to run the orchestra day to day, a strong\nconductor, of course, but someone who could really galvanize the\ninstitution, conceive stimulating programs, commission worthy\ncomposers and reach out to the larger urban area? Then bring in the\neminences and heavyweights as guests to perform the great repertory\nthey are steeped in by cultural heritage and long advocacy. Sir\nColin Davis serves this latter role well at the Philharmonic, as no\ndoubt Masur will and should when his directorship ends.\n\n   Orchestras would be wise to take more chances. Leonard Bernstein\nwasn't ``Leonard Bernstein'' when he was appointed to the\nPhilharmonic post. He was a dynamic, not-yet-40 gamble, which is\nprobably why for his first season, 1957-58, he was a joint\nprincipal conductor with Dimitri Mitropoulos, and only the next\nseason was given the job for himself, becoming the first American\nmusic director of a major orchestra in the United States. Obviously\nthe gamble paid off. Of course, by some accounts, for all the\nexcitement that Bernstein engendered, the playing of the orchestra\nslipped during his tenure. Recordings from the Bernstein era\nsuggest otherwise. And, unlike every foreign-born conductor in an\nAmerican post today, Bernstein did not need an artistic adviser on\nstaff to tell him what to do.\n\n   Perhaps the Philharmonic feels it got burned by its experience\nwith Zubin Mehta, who was 42 and hot when he was brought in to give\nthe orchestra some pizazz after its noble experiment with the\nformidably intellectual Pierre Boulez, Bernstein's successor. But\nMehta was not too young and hip; he was too flashy and superficial.\n\n   Masur was recruited in 1991 to bring order to an orchestra that\nhad grown unruly, to raise standards and to provide rigorous\ninterpretive insights into the core repertory. He has succeeded on\nall counts. Yet the dismayingly conventional programming he has\nplanned for next year suggests that he is creatively spent.\n\n   He will begin the season with a mini-festival of Mendelssohn, a\ncomposer to whom he has a special claim, having directed the\nLeipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, which Mendelssohn himself conducted\nfor 12 years. Though this promises to be distinguished music\nmaking, it would be more welcome if the rest of the season were not\nso fixed in the Central European mainstream. There will be lots of\nBrahms, Schumann, Dvorak and Mozart. A concert in October,\nconducted by Leonard Slatkin, billed as ``honoring the memory of\nLeonard Bernstein,'' offers only one work of his, the ``Jeremiah''\nSymphony; the bulk of the program is devoted to Mendelssohn's G\nminor Piano Concerto and Dvorak's Eighth Symphony.\n\n   To his credit, Masur will acknowledge the 75th birthday of the\nimportant German composer Hans Werne Henze with the American\npremiere of his Ninth Symphony and Beethoven's joyous ``Choral\nFantasy'' as a curtain raiser. But for the most part when a new or\nrecent work is performed (for example, a premiere by Oliver\nKnussen), it is sandwiched between crowd pleasers (in that case\nBruch's Violin Concerto and Strauss's ``Also Sprach Zarathustra'').\nSo don't be scared when you learn that Masur will conduct the New\nYork premiere of Bright Sheng's ``Red Silk Dance'' for Piano and\nOrchestra; Emanuel Ax, the soloist in that work, will also play\nLiszt's Second Concerto on a program dominated by Brahms's Second\nSymphony. The message indirectly conveyed is that the orchestra is\nso afraid of trying something a bit daring that it must be packaged\nwith reassuring favorites.\n\n   nn\n\n   Muti is a conductor of great stature. I will not soon forget the\nthree concerts he presented last year at Carnegie Hall with the\nVienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The programs were traditional, the\nmost recent work being Shostakovich's famous Fifth Symphony. But\nthe playing was incomparable. Muti's authoritarian approach is\nsuited, it would seem, to this virtually all-male, tradition-bound\norchestra. Yet to his credit, Muti also got some exciting results\nfrom the New York Philharmonic in recent appearances.\n\n   But what kind of artistic leader would he have made over the\nlong term? It is hard to imagine what New York cultural or\neducational institutions Muti would have formed natural alliances\nwith. It's equally hard to cite a modern composer with whom Muti\nhas been associated the way, say, Esa-Pekka Salonen, the excellent\nyoung Finnish-born conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony, has been\nlinked with Gyorgy Ligeti and Witold Lutoslawski. Salonen's\nartistic leadership has not drawn across-the-board praise. Many\nWest Coast composers complain that in commissioning composers from\nhis own generation, Salonen has favored Europeans he knows, which\nshows the major drawback of not having an American in charge.\n\n   The word is that the Philharmonic musicians strongly wanted\nMuti. If true, it's curious. What were they thinking? Perhaps\nsomething along the lines of, ``Maestro Masur has raised the level\nof our Beethoven and Bruckner to a new high, and Maestro Muti will\ntake it higher still.''\n\n   Consider, in comparison, how Michael Tilson Thomas has turned\nconcert night at the San Francisco Symphony into a cultural must\nfor young and old alike. His programs are alive with new and recent\nworks and neglected 20th-century repertory. Yet his audiences get\nplenty of Mahler and Brahms. At the opening concert of the\norchestra's ambitious Stravinsky festival last summer, the audience\ncould have been mistaken for a movie crowd in New York on Saturday\nnight. Thomas is a great match for San Francisco, with a palpable\nconnection to American music and strong ties to local composers.\n\n   Robert Spano, 38, a superb technician and orchestra builder,\nmight have been the kind of exciting, younger, thinking artistic\ndirector I'm calling for. Imagine the Philharmonic with Spano as\nits adventurous leader, someone with big ambitions but\nself-confident enough to regularly welcome eminent conductors as\nguests. Unfortunately, Spano knew that he was probably too young\nand too local (as the conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic) to\nget the Philharmonic job or any of the other major posts about to\nbe vacated. So he accepted the Atlanta Symphony, a good orchestra,\nthough perhaps not the best fit: Spano's innovative programming may\nbe a hard sell for its conservative subscribers.\n\n   Apparently the Philadelphia Orchestra is looking hard at the\n41-year-old American conductor David Robertson. Though no\ncelebrity, he would be an exciting choice. Robertson honed his\nconducting skills with complex modern music as an associate of\nPierre Boulez in France. Two years ago he conducted thrilling\nperformances of daunting works by Elliott Carter and Boulez with\nthe New Juilliard Ensemble. As music director of the Orchestre\nNational de Lyon, he has covered the standard repertory thoroughly.\nHe has also conducted opera impressively, including Janacek's\n``Makropoulos Affair'' at the Metropolitan. If the Philharmonic\nwould adjust its thinking, Robertson could be an inspiring choice.\n\n   Instead, among the names being leaked are two more foreigners\nwith established reputations: Mariss Jansons, 57, the Latvian-born\nmusic director of the Pittsburgh Symphony and the associate\nprincipal conductor of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia,\nand Christoph Eschenbach, 60, the German chief conductor of the NDR\nSymphony in Hamburg. Both are perfectly fine conductors and solid\nmusicians who would bring indisputable skills to the post. Neither\nwould seem to be a lively risk-taker who might reach out to\ncomposers and invigorate the city's culture.\n\n   Zarin Mehta, the Philharmonic's new executive director, is said\nto be high on both men. My guess is that either would be presented\nto the public as a conductor steeped in the European tradition and,\nthough not as famous or dynamic as Muti, quite distinguished.\n\n   True. But perhaps ``distinction'' has been overvalued in\nrecruiting music directors to American orchestras. Just by being\nappointed to lead the New York Philharmonic, a less-well-known\nAmerican would acquire instant distinction. And it would be\nrefreshing to have someone truly imaginative and exciting, someone\nwho respects the European tradition but is not cowed by it. It's\nsomething to think about. And now that Muti is out of the picture,\nthere is time to do just that.\n","Headline":"\nNOTEBOOK: A NEW CHANCE FOR NEW MUSIC  \n      \n","Text":["\n   The New York Philharmonic's courtship of the conductor Riccardo\nMuti has ended, amicably, it appears, but with no success.
