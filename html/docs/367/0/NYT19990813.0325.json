Times News Service   \n\n   SEOUL, South Korea _ As Microsoft Corp. expands its dominance of\nthe world's computer software markets, it has tried hard not to\nruffle the feathers of foreign governments and nationalists, who\noften view the American software giant as a predator.\n\n   Nevertheless, in maneuvering to gain control of the lucrative\nmarket for Korean-language word processing software, it set off a\ngroundswell of opposition.\n\n   ``No one could have predicted that Koreans would have responded\nthe way they did to Microsoft,'' said D.H. Oh, managing director of\nIDC Korea, a brokerage house here. ``It was probably the first time\nthat an entire nation, from the central government to corporations\nto private citizens, combined forces to save a local industry.''\n\n   The tale began a year ago, when South Korea's leading software\ndeveloper, the Hangul and Computer Co., was one step from\nbankruptcy, a victim of poor management, Asia's financial crisis\nand rampant software piracy.\n\n   Microsoft agreed to inject $20 million into the Korean company.\nIn return, Hangul and Computer was to stop producing its own\npopular word- processing software, which commanded 80 percent of\nthe word-processing market, and start selling Microsoft's\nKorean-language Word, which then had less than 15 percent.\n\n   For a rather small investment, Microsoft seemed about to gain\ncontrol of South Korea's word-processing software industry, one of\nthe few markets in the world that the company did not dominate.\n\n   Microsoft was already by far the biggest player in the overall\nKorean software market, which is estimated to be worth $5 billion\nto $6 billion, but it played second fiddle to Hangul and Computer\nin the word-processing sector.\n\n   Once South Koreans _ well known for their nationalistic fervor _\ngot wind of the deal that would have extended Microsoft's\ndominance, public outrage was so strong that Hangul and Computer\nleft Microsoft standing at the altar.\n\n   Instead, the company accepted a $10 million investment raised by\nKorean computer-related businesses and associations that led a\nnationwide campaign to save Hangul _ which many Koreans regarded as\na national technological treasure _ from foreign control.\n\n   As part of the campaign, the central government promised to\ncrack down on software piracy and began with its own computers,\nmany of which used unlicensed versions of Hangul and Computer's\nsoftware. Legitimate copies of the software _ named Hangul after\nthe Korean language _ were installed.\n\n   Following that lead, thousands of guilt-stricken South Koreans\nwho were using pirated Hangul software either bought authorized\nversions or donated money to the campaign.\n\n   Now, bolstered by a surge of government orders and a new\nmanagement team, Hangul and Computer has made a remarkable\nturnaround. ``Our sales have climbed through the roof, we've\nreduced our debt, we are attracting foreign investment and we are\ndeveloping new products,'' said Ha Jin Jhun, Hangul and Computer's\nnew president. ``You can say that we've fully recovered.''\n\n   After reporting a net loss equivalent to $3.8 million for 1998,\nthe company projects that it will have net income of $4.9 million\nthis year. Revenues, which had tumbled to $11.7 million last year _\ndown nearly $7 million in two years _ are expected to reach $28.3\nmillion this year.\n\n   In the year since Hangul teetered on the verge of bankruptcy,\nits market capitalization has grown fivefold, to $16.7 million.\n\n   Jhun, who was brought in to restructure the company after it\nbacked out of the Microsoft deal, said his first order of business\nwas to refinance the company's debt and reduce its costs. He cut\nthe work force of several hundred by about 10 percent and shut down\nunprofitable businesses, including publications, educational\nprograms and hardware distribution. He also slashed research and\ndevelopment efforts.\n\n   Jhun then sought to capitalize on the national campaign to save\nthe company. The campaign encouraged Koreans _ both businesses and\nindividuals _ to destroy pirated copies of the software and buy\nlegitimate ones. (Last year, industry analysts estimated that 60\npercent to 70 percent of all software programs in use in South\nKorea were pirated.)\n\n   To facilitate the purchases of legitimate copies, Jhun cut\nprices, began selling the software in places as diverse as banks\nand supermarkets and introduced a special edition that sold a\nrecord 700,000 copies.\n\n   Seeking to assure Hangul's long-term success, Jhun said, he\nplans to turn the company into South Korea's ``largest and\nforemost'' Internet service provider.\n\n   ``We see our major revenue growth coming from the Internet,'' he\nsaid, ``and we will soon introduce a one-stop-package service that\nprovides electronic commerce, cybertrading, e-mail, advertising,\nand a virtual office all in one.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Do Haeng Heo, an analyst for Daewoo Securities, has issued a buy\nrecommendation for Hangul and Computer, which he predicts will post\na net profit of $9.25 million this year. He cited ``the\npossibilities behind a take-off of the Internet business,'' which,\nhe said, is still in its formative stage in South Korea.\n\n   Microsoft, meanwhile, has continued its aggressive pursuit of\nthe South Korean software market, and its revenue has soared, too.\n\n   Geun Kim, director of marketing for Microsoft Korea, said that\nwhile South Korea is currently a marginal market for Microsoft in\ndollar value, it has great potential because of the country's high\nrate of personal computer use and high level of education.\n\n   Microsoft Korea's revenues increased 110 percent last year, Kim\nsaid, buoyed by rising orders from the public sector and individual\nusers. He expects revenues to reach $100 million this year, a 5\npercent to 10 percent increase over last year. About 55 percent of\nMicrosoft Korea's total revenues come from software products like\nWord and Office that compete directly with Hangul and Computer.\n\n   Both Microsoft Korea and Hangul and Computer have been able to\nregister growth in revenue, analysts say, as the Korean software\npiracy rate has fallen 10 percent in the last year, thanks in large\npart to the campaign to save Hangul.\n\n   ``I think this affair had a very positive impact on the\nindustry,'' Kim said. ``The industry and the public are better\nserved by having two healthy competitors.''\n\n   Hangul and Computer's view is not so convivial. It has filed a\ndumping charge against Microsoft.\n\n   Microsoft recently introduced a new version of its\nKorean-language software _ one that offers many of the features\nthat have made Hangul's product so popular with South Koreans,\nincluding a graphics function that allows users to incorporate\nboxes, tables and graphs within the text.\n\n   Also, the new version of Word can express the Korean alphabet in\nmore than 11,000 combinations, including those needed to represent\narchaic words and expressions. Microsoft's previous version was\nlimited to a few thousand combinations and was viewed by many\nKoreans, especially academics, as insufficient.\n\n   Microsoft's new program has been selling well, especially since\nthe company slashed prices last month to match those of Hangul and\nComputer. Microsoft says that it is offering discounts to schools\nin an effort to capture young computer users.\n\n   Those discounts led Hangul and Computer to file the dumping\ncharge against Microsoft with the South Korean Fair Trade\nCommission, accusing the American company of selling its\neducational software package at a steep discount to gain market\nshare in South Korea. The trade commission says that an\ninvestigation of Hangul's complaint is under way.\n\n   Microsoft said that under a program started in July, schools can\nbuy any piece of its software for an up-front payment of 10 percent\nof the normal end-user price, calculated on an annual license-fee\nbasis. Hangul had pioneered the use of such yearly license fee\narrangements in South Korea.\n\n   ``To pay $20 million to buy an entire software market is not\nonly cheap; it's unfair and it's wrong,'' Jhun said.\n\n   ``Microsoft is not content with just killing off local software\ncompanies,'' he added. ``It wants to wipe out an entire industry,\nand Koreans did not stand for that.''\n","Headline":"\nHOW KOREAN PRIDE TRIPPED MICROSOFT AND SAVED A SOFTWARE MAKER  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 15) \n","Text":["\n   SEOUL, South Korea _ As Microsoft Corp. expands its dominance of\nthe world's computer software markets, it has tried hard not to\nruffle the feathers of foreign governments and nationalists, who\noften view the American software giant as a predator.\n","\n   Nevertheless, in maneuvering to gain control of the lucrative\nmarket for Korean-language word processing software, it set off a\ngroundswell of opposition.\n","\n   ``No one could have predicted that Koreans would have responded\nthe way they did to Microsoft,'' said D.H.
