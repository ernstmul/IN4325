Needless to say, the Material\nGirl was not amused.\n\n   And she was not alone. As the summer wore on, illicit copies of\nother forms of entertainment appeared all over the Internet.\nBootleg versions of such movie blockbusters as ``Gladiator'' and\n``Me, Myself, and Irene'' popped up on networks like Scour Exchange\nand Gnutella shortly after their release in theaters. And the\nhottest book of the season, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire,'' was traded illegally online within hours after it hit the\nstores.\n\n   Clearly, file sharing isn't just for music anymore. Virtually\nanything that can be reduced to digital bits is becoming a\ncommodity, and the entertainment and publishing industries are\ngrappling with ways to protect copyrighted material at a time when\nthe very notion of intellectual property is being challenged. Even\nthe needlepoint industry is running scared: Ladies who stitch\nsamplers are trading patterns online, and one pattern publisher,\nSouth Carolina-based Pegasus Originals, has reported a 40 percent\ndrop in revenue since 1997.\n\n   Tension is building between the old economy copyright owners _\nthe record labels, movie studios, and publishing houses _ and the\nnew economy entrepreneurs who are constantly inventing new ways to\ndistribute content. Meanwhile, consumers are rapidly embracing the\nnew technology even as the entertainment industry is frantically\ntrying to curtail its spread.\n\n   ``There is a turf war going on over the hearts and minds of\nconsumers and the way they use content,'' says Eric Sheirer, media\nand entertainment analyst for Forrester Research. ``The content\nindustry and the technology industry are battling it out, and they\nreally can't both win. Their interests are not aligned.''\n\n   So far, the content industry appears to be winning _ at least in\nthe courts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge ruled that MP3.com\nviolated the copyrights of Universal Music Group by offering its\nCDs for play over the Internet and ordered potentially crippling\ndamages that could hit $250 million. Last month, the Motion Picture\nIndustry Association of America scored a victory when a federal\njudge ruled that it is illegal to publish DeCSS, a program used to\ncrack antipiracy features on DVDs. And in July, a federal judge in\nSan Francisco issued an injunction to shut down the wildly popular\nNapster service; the order is on hold pending appeal, and the case\nreturns to the courts next month.\n\n   But despite the court rulings, the concept of file-sharing is\nbecoming ingrained in the public consciousness. Users, particularly\ncollege students and young professionals, are growing accustomed to\neasy access to music sampling services, and litigation only seems\nto increase Napster's hold on the popular imagination. For\ninstance, traffic to Napster.com surged the week after the court\nruling, according to Media Metrix, the New York-based market\nresearch firm that measures Internet usage. And in July, Napster\nhit Media Metrix's list of the top 50 US digital media and Web\nproperties; the service currently claims to have more than 20\nmillion users.\n\n   So can tens of millions of people be wrong? ``You can't impose a\nlaw that is not morally upheld by the vast majority of people,''\nsays Internet activist John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the\nElectronic Freedom Foundation. ``And you can't impose a standard\nthat can be broken _ and just about all of them can.''\n\n   This isn't just an economic battle between those who hold that\ninformation should be free and those who claim they ought to be\npaid for content. There are enormous cultural implications to the\ndebate as well. There is nothing new about file sharing; early\nadopters have been sharing digital photographs (albeit, mostly\npornography) and text files since the early days of bulletin board\nservices. But now that file sharing has become mainstream, the\ntechnology creates enormous potential for previously unheard voices\nto reach the masses.\n\n   Unsigned record artists, independent filmmakers, and unknown\nnovelists are all using the Internet to get their products seen and\nheard by the public, creating new niche markets and forging offbeat\ncultural communities.\n\n   ``There are huge cultural advantages to allowing or facilitating\nInternet distribution of these materials,'' says Harvard Law School\nprofessor William Fisher. ``It expands the set of authors who can\nreach the media and reduces the grip on popular culture by a small\nnumber of dominant American companies. It would be a tragedy if the\nopportunity for the communication of these materials were lost\nbecause of excessive protectionism.''\n\n   At the same time, though, artists must have some incentive to\ncreate their work in the first place. ``Unless we can come up with\nalternative arrangements for compensating creators, those\nincentives will be eroded, and we'll be throwing out the baby with\nthe bath water,'' Fisher adds. ``And that is an equal tragedy.''\n\n   Therein lies the dilemma. How do you encourage the cultural\ndiversification made possible by the Internet while also ensuring\nthat artists get paid for their work? Some in the entertainment\nindustry insist that the immediate solution lies in the courts.\n\n   ``We are going to make it very clear that stealing is wrong, and\nwe will not hesitate to go to the courts,'' says Jack Valenti,\npresident of the Motion Picture Association, which is suing\nScour.com, the company that runs a popular multimedia search engine\nand file-swapping service.\n\n   But most legal scholars _ and a growing number of executives in\nthe entertainment industry _ contend that the lawsuits are a waste\nof time and money.\n\n   ``Notwithstanding the large verdict against MP3.com, lawsuits\naren't a very good way to make money,'' says Mark Lemley, a\nprofessor of intellectual property law at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley law school. ``If we are going to get a\nsolution, it is going to come from the content industry being\nwilling to make the leap into online distribution.''\n\n   Of course, the content companies have claimed all along that\nthey plan to come out with systems that enable consumers to\npurchase and hear music online.\n\n   ``I don't see litigation as the be-all and the end-all,'' says\nHilary Rosen, president and CEO of the Recording Industry\nAssociation of America, the umbrella group representing the music\nindustry in the cases against Napster, MP3.com, and Scour. ``I see\nit as an important tool in sending a message to venture capitalists\nthat the way to support innovation is to respect the creative\ninterests. But I am also very clear that the music business has to\nevolve, and it is in everybody's interest to create a legitimate\nonline music business.''\n\n   But the music industry, in particular, tends to move with the\nspeed of an oil tanker negotiating a narrow inlet. And so far, its\nonline efforts have been less than spectacular. EMI, Sony, and\nUniversal Music Group recently entered the digital download\nbusiness, offering a limited number of albums for sale online. But\nconsumers used to the ease of Napster haven't exactly raced to\ncheck out these offerings, and the few consumers who have tried to\nbuy digital music from the major labels have experienced technical\ndifficulties.\n\n   ``There is no question that there have been growing pains, and\nsome initial starts have been awkward,'' concedes Rosen. ``Everyone\nis doing the best they can, and there is a will and a path and a\nhuge amount of investment going into doing this.''\n\n   In addition to the technical problems, the music industry has\nsuffered a backlash since it took on Napster and other file-sharing\nservices. After the heavy metal band Metallica sued Napster, its\nown fans ridiculed the band and its leader, drummer Lars Ulrich,\nposting parodies of the band online and vowing to boycott their\nalbums.\n\n   As a result, the book industry wants to learn from the music\nindustry's mistakes and avoid a public relations embarrassment. As\na group, the book publishers haven't been as aggressive in taking\ntheir case to the courts, for a number of reasons. The book\naudience is older than the popular music audience, and piracy is\nnot as prevalent _ yet. Likewise, electronic reading devices are\nstill a novelty embraced primarily by early adopters.\n\n   But that doesn't mean the book industry is sitting back idly.\n``We are watching the litigation very closely,'' says Allan Adler,\nvice president of legal and government affairs for the Association\nof American Publishers. Last month, the association launched an\nanti-piracy Web site and announced a strategy to promote legal,\nprotected books for sale online.\n\n   But at least one author, science fiction writer Harlan Ellison,\nsays the industry isn't doing enough to ward off piracy. His books\nand stories are routinely traded online, and he has sued individual\nWeb site operators as well as Internet service providers, including\nAmerica Online, that he claims facilitate piracy. He won a case\nagainst an individual pirate, but he has been unsuccessful so far\nbattling the big ISPs in the courts. Ellison sees a sense of\nurgency in dealing with the problem and has one word to describe\npublishers who have yet to take legal action: ``Dinosaurs.''\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nWHO STOLE MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY? \n","Text":["\n   At the beginning of the summer, a copy of an unreleased single\nfrom Madonna's upcoming album ``Music'' found its way onto Napster,\nthe popular file-swapping service.
