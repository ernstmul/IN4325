Times News Service   \n\n   SEATTLE _ Just as the school shooting in Colorado last month has\nspurred Congress to the verge of approving measures like background\nchecks for gun buyers and safety-lock devices for firearms, many\nstate legislatures are passing gun-control laws as well, in some\ncases taking up measures that had long been considered unlikely\never to pass.\n\n   When the California Assembly gathered late last month to debate\na bill limiting handgun sales to one per person per month, a\nmeasure that had languished in past years, Assemblyman Dick Floyd\nrose to speak and the chamber grew hushed. The crusty lawmaker, an\nArmy sergeant in the Korean War, is known among his colleagues as a\nwisecracker, but he was dead serious this time.\n\n   ``For over 20 years around here,'' said Floyd, a 68-year-old\nDemocrat, ``I never spoke one time on any issue relating to guns.\nIn fact, I was a nonparticipant. I never voted for one of these\nbills.'' But the school killings in Littleton, Colo., he said, had\nbrought back images of the combat he faced nearly half a century\nago. He described the ``horrible smell'' of it all, and then he had\nan announcement.\n\n   ``I'm no longer going to be a nonparticipant,'' Floyd said. ``I\nam willing not only to vote for everything, I'll co-author every\ngun bill that comes along.''\n\n   The bill passed, and other measures restricting gun ownership\nare moving forward in Sacramento, with promises that Gov. Gray\nDavis, a Democrat inaugurated in January, will sign them. And while\nFloyd's conversion may have been especially dramatic, it is a\npowerful symbol of the changing dynamics of the gun-control debate\nin state legislatures since the April 20 massacre at Columbine High\nSchool in Littleton, in which two students killed 12 classmates and\na teacher before killing themselves.\n\n   The gun-control measures moving forward now include an Oregon\nplan to require criminal background checks for people buying\nfirearms at gun shows and a bill that would make New Jersey the\nfirst state to require that within five years all handguns sold\nthere have ``smart-gun'' features, allowing a gun to be used only\nby its registered owner. That bill has been voted out of a Senate\ncommittee.\n\n   In Connecticut, lawmakers are supporting a measure that would\nallow the police to get a warrant to enter a residence and take the\nguns of a person who might injure himself or others.\n\n   Just as striking, gun-rights proponents in other states have\npulled back legislation they were hoping to get passed this year.\nPerhaps most notably, right after the Littleton shooting, Colorado\nlawmakers quickly abandoned their push for new laws to expand the\nright to carry concealed weapons and to prevent local governments\nfrom passing gun-control laws.\n\n   In Florida, the sponsor withdrew legislation that would have\npre-empted cities and counties from filing lawsuits against gun\nmanufacturers.\n\n   ``I really think this is like a big volcano that's suddenly\nerupted, sort of the Mount St. Helen's of the gun tragedy in\nAmerica,'' said Pamela Eakes, the founder and president of Mothers\nAgainst Violence in America, a 5-year-old group based in Seattle\nthat has 60 chapters around the country. ``Littleton has sparked\nsomething, a permanent response. People are just saying, `Enough,'\nand legislators are clearly responding to that.''\n\n   Other gun-control measures in the states include an Illinois\nbill, passed by the Legislature late last month and endorsed by\nGov. George Ryan, requiring gun owners to keep their firearms\nlocked away from children, with a possible prison term for the\nowner if a youth uses the adult's gun in a crime.\n\n   In Utah, shaken recently by two highly publicized shootings by\npeople with mental illness in downtown Salt Lake City, in addition\nto the tragedy in neighboring Colorado, the Legislature is\nconsidering a special session to deal with gun-control issues.\n\n   In Arizona last month, Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a Republican, vetoed\na bill that would have barred cities and counties from enacting a\nrange of local gun-control ordinances. And in Ohio, Gov. Bob Taft,\nalso a Republican, announced just days after the Littleton shooting\nthat he would oppose a bill allowing the state's citizens to carry\nconcealed weapons.\n\n   In the relatively few instances since Littleton in which the gun\nadvocates have scored successes, they have been met with a\nblistering counterattack. In Michigan, a battle is raging over\nseparate measures passed in recent weeks by the two legislative\nhouses that would make it easier to carry concealed weapons. The\nbills need to be reconciled before they can become law.\n\n   Opponents have already started a campaign to get a statewide\nreferendum on the ballot that would overturn such a law. This week\nthey got the Major League Baseball Players Association to issue a\nstatement condemning the gun measures, saying such laws would let\npeople take weapons to ballparks and ``would present unwarranted\nrisks for fans and players.''\n\n   What is unclear at this point is whether the shift in the\nlegislative terrain on gun issues is a lasting one, or simply a\nshort-term response to the Colorado tragedy whose force will\ndissipate in the coming months.\n\n   Gun-control advocates and many state lawmakers who support their\ncause said in interviews last week that the public outcry was far\nmore intense than it had been after other school shootings in\nrecent years, partly because of the number of students killed and\npartly because of the cumulative effect of all of the incidents.\n\n   But critics of the gun-control measures, and pro-gun lawmakers\nwho said they pulled back on their proposals only because of the\npolitical climate and not because of any lack of merit, said most\nof the new laws were an emotional fix that would do virtually\nnothing to prevent the kind of violence that occurred in Littleton.\nAnd some were particularly adamant that Littleton showed the need\nfor more guns, not fewer.\n\n   In Michigan, state Rep. Mike Green, a Republican sponsor of the\nbill that would make it easier for people to obtain permits to\ncarry concealed weapons, described the Littleton shooting as a\n``sad commentary on people being unable to defend themselves'' and\nsaid that his measure would make schools safer.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   ``When we make gun-free zones like we do in the schools, we're\nreally creating vacuums in those places, where anyone who wants to\ndo harm knows there's no one there to stop them, other than hitting\nthem with a stick or throwing a rock at them,'' Green, who is from\nMayville, in central Michigan, said in a telephone interview.\n\n   ``I believe in our schools there ought to be somebody, somewhere\nwith a gun that could defend these kids, but everybody says, `Oh My\nGod, we couldn't do that, no guns in the schools.'''\n\n   The Littleton school did have an armed sheriff's deputy assigned\nto it. He exchanged gunfire briefly with one of the suspects after\nthe attack began, but was unable to stop them.\n\n   The Michigan measure, which would take discretion on permits\naway from county gun boards and basically create a right to carry\nconcealed weapons as long as an applicant meets a series of\nrequirements, was part of the campaign platform of many Republicans\nwho ran for office last fall. The party took control of both\nlegislative houses in that election.\n\n   But many Democrats said that public sentiment had definitely\nshifted against the concept, and they said they were dumbfounded\nthat Republican party leaders were so intent on getting the measure\napproved.\n\n   ``This is truly beyond me, for all my years in politics, as to\nwhy they are doing this,'' said Gilda Jacobs, a Democratic state\nrepresentative from suburban Detroit, who said she and many of her\ncolleagues had been flooded with calls from angry constituents\nabout the bills. ``You'd think that, just politically, they would\nsay this doesn't make any sense to go through with this. Their\ntiming couldn't be worse.''\n\n   The issue represents a dilemma for Gov. John Engler, also a\nRepublican and a potential vice presidential candidate. He\nindicated through a spokesman two weeks ago that he was inclined to\nsign the bills, but in recent days he seems to have backed off.\nThis week he told supporters of the concealed-weapons measure that\nnow might not be the best time to push ahead.\n\n   ``You could certainly say the timing is open to\nmisinterpretation,'' he said on Wednesday. ``Some people will play\npolitics with it.''\n\n   But Green said he hoped the bills would be reconciled soon and\nturned into law, so that people could have at least a year to see\nthat the idea works before he and his colleagues head into the 2000\nelections.\n\n   In some ways, the setbacks encountered by gun-rights advocates\nbegan well before the Littleton shooting.\n\n   After the 1994 elections, when Republicans took control of\nCongress and many state legislatures, those advocates scored some\nof their most striking victories, including persuading 10\nlegislatures to establish or expand the right to carry concealed\nweapons. But such efforts have failed in at least eight other\nstates in the past two years, and many states were already moving\nforward this year with restrictive measures.\n\n   In California, with Davis' strong support, the Legislature\nclearly seemed headed even before April 20 to impose a new ban on\nassault weapons and require child safety locks on guns. But the\nreaction after the Littleton shooting, including Floyd's emotional\nconversion to anti-gun causes, has clearly given new force to that\nside.\n\n   ``What we've seen in the past is state legislators have often\nresponded to the gun lobby'' even if public-opinion polls favored\ngun control, said Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation for\nHandgun Control, an advocacy group based in Washington. ``What's\nchanged is that the public is now paying very, very close attention\nto what legislators are doing on gun issues. People really do think\nthere's just far too much access to guns, and their lawmakers are\nhearing about it.''\n\n   Gun-rights groups concede that there has been a public outcry\nsince Littleton and the recent school shooting in suburban Atlanta,\nthough they say that many of the gun-curbing proposals offered\nsince then are misguided efforts to deal with a cultural problem\nnot caused by guns.\n\n   And the National Rifle Association said that despite the\nattention focused on the gun-control measures now moving through\nCongress and the statehouses, it had achieved success in blocking\nmany of the proposals.\n\n   It has defeated one-gun-a-month proposals in Pennsylvania and\nIllinois, the group said, and advanced on legislation pre-empting\nthe rights of cities and counties to file lawsuits against the\nfirearms industry.\n\n   So far this year, the rifle association said, such measures have\nbeen signed into law in seven states (Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,\nGeorgia, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming), are awaiting a\ngovernor's signature in four states (Maine, Nevada, Texas and\nTennessee) and are pending before legislatures in at least nine\nstates.\n","Headline":"\nACROSS THE U.S., LAWMAKERS RALLY BEHIND GUN LAWS \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Just as the school shooting in Colorado last month has\nspurred Congress to the verge of approving measures like background\nchecks for gun buyers and safety-lock devices for firearms, many\nstate legislatures are passing gun-control laws as well, in some\ncases taking up measures that had long been considered unlikely\never to pass.\n","\n   When the California Assembly gathered late last month to debate\na bill limiting handgun sales to one per person per month, a\nmeasure that had languished in past years, Assemblyman Dick Floyd\nrose to speak and the chamber grew hushed.
