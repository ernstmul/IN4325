Times News Service   \n\n   Words have been much on music's mind lately, and the two have\nbeen as much opponents as colleagues. Watching important literary\nproperties (``The Great Gatsby,'' ``A Streetcar Named Desire'')\nbeing wrestled to the ground musically has become a sporting event.\n\n   For better or worse, words seem to be coming out on top. New\noperas have to have selling points, and music is not first among\nthem.\n\n   Manifestos are easier than the great books. Social and racial\njustice are can't-miss categories (``Harvey Milk,'' ``Marilyn,''\n``Malcolm X''). Narrate the thundering international incident\n(``The Death of Klinghoffer''); add music to the popular movie\n(Jake Heggie's soon-to-be ``Dead Man Walking'').\n\n   F. Scott Fitzgerald and Tennessee Williams have more cachet, but\nany topical news item or publicity-drenched cause will do. First\nthe sexy idea, then how to illustrate it with a lot of loud\nsinging.\n\n   ``Gatsby'' and ``Streetcar'' have had the tougher problem. Their\nnewsy companions, with no texts set in stone, have enjoyed free\nrides into mediocrity. How were John Harbison and Andre Previn to\nget away with ``Gatsby'' and ``Streetcar'' with the authors looking\nover their shoulders?\n\n   Harbison may have looked back too often, thus becalming his new\npiece with an undue reverence for the original. Previn's opera\nmoved gingerly through its minefield of famous scenes and\nmuch-quoted lines. In ``The Festival of Regrets,'' part of the New\nYork City Opera's recent triptych, ``Central Park,'' Deborah\nDrattell treated Wendy Wasserstein's clever libretto with such\nopen-mouthed awe that her music dwindled to near-invisibility.\n\n   Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' currently running wild on\nBroadway, may have a better idea. Its center is Shakespeare's\n``Taming of the Shrew,'' and bits of that hallowed text run through\nthe evening. But Shakespeare's plot is hollowed out. Broad outlines\nare left standing; virtually everything else is trashed and hauled\naway.\n\n   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' ignores the play's maze of exchanged and\nhidden identities. Some of the clever wordplay and punning\nsurvives, but most of it gives way to songs like ``So in Love'' and\n``From This Moment On'' and Porter's fiendishly clever lyrics.\n\n   Music can't emulate Shakespeare or Fitzgerald or Williams, but\nwhat it can do is leave the walls of their writing untouched and\nbuild something entirely new inside. An architect friend of mine\ncalls it ``adaptive use.'' We see examples all over Lower\nManhattan; and for urban renewers across the land, the idea is a\nform of daily bread.\n\n   What to do with a handsome loft building in SoHo once floor upon\nfloor of small manufacturers have disappeared? An earlier\ngeneration would have torn it down and begun all over again. The\npresent one preserves the facade and puts behind it overpriced\nliving spaces, art galleries and clothing shops with Italian names.\n\n   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' proudly advertises its lack of fidelity by\noffering a play within a play, the backstage drama emanating from\nand sometimes bleeding into what happens before the footlights.\nAnother thing that gives this revival at the Martin Beck Theater\nsuch a healthy look is its commercialism. It is trying to make\nmoney by making audiences happy; and so there has been some inner\nas well as outer adaptive use going on.\n\n   The 1948 original pretty much went along with the Elizabethan\nidea of womanly subservience. In the year 2000, delicate revision\nallows Kate's elaborate postlude on wifely virtues to be delivered\nwith a smirk or two. Happily, Shakespeare's urtext has an\nincorruptible life of its own.\n\n   Public reverence and public subsidy make sure that ``Kiss Me,\nKate'' can't touch it. The inviolability of the Fitzgerald and\nWilliams originals is equally assured, but that fact needn't stop\nopera composers from ripping out any walls they want. It certainly\ndidn't stop Verdi, who used the bare bones of his beloved\nShakespearean plays and reconstituted them with powerful Italian\nmelodrama.\n\n   This is one neighborhood zoned for anti-authenticity. If our\nSoHo loft building really hewed to contextual accuracy, it would\nrecreate the old lost companies within its spruced-up walls and set\nthem to making parts for machines now extinct. Maybe these\noperations could get a grant from the National Endowment for the\nArts or gifts from the French and German ministries of culture. I\ncan't think of anyone who would pay them money otherwise.\n\n   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' bears a resemblance to one of those railroad\nstations turned shopping center. Some trains may go in and out just\nto keep the original atmosphere alive, but the waiting rooms and\nall the attendant dramas of travel are pushed pretty much to the\nside.\n\n   Opera composers often begin with other people's words; the\nquestion is, who will be boss? The horrifying drabness of most\nmusic on Broadway suggests composers dedicated to making sure that\nwe understand every overamplified line.
