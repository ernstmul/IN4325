He doesn't want to allow the same kind of rampant\ndigital piracy that he says has beset the record industry.\n\n   ``If we have to file a thousand lawsuits a day, we'll do it,''\nsaid a defiant Valenti. ``It's less expensive than losing control\nof all your creative works.''\n\n   Indeed, the MPAA and other industry groups have filed several\nlawsuits in the past month trying to stop a variety of Web site\noperators from spreading the tools that entertainment companies\nfear open the door to widespread digital piracy of movies and\nmusic.\n\n   But on the other side of the showdown, the so-called outlaws say\nthey have the law on their side, including the shield of the First\nAmendment rights to free speech.\n\n   They say the technological advances that let consumers download\ndigital music, books and eventually top-flight films right from the\nInternet to their homes are already bringing a new sheriff to town.\n\n   That means the old-guard entertainment industry leaders will\neither have to get with the program, or get out of town.\n\n   ``It's not about hacking, it's not about copyright infringement,\nit's not about piracy,'' said Tom McGuire, vice president of\ncommunication for the Electronic Frontier Foundation of San\nFrancisco.\n\n   ``The industry is evolving at such a fast pace and it is so\nempowering to consumers that (consumer-driven technical innovation)\nis going to happen. The motion picture business would be better off\nembracing what's going on and not villain-izing everybody,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Experts in intellectual property and entertainment say the\nmotion picture industry's battle against hackers is the latest in a\nnumber of important showdowns over who will control distribution of\ntraditional consumer entertainment, like music, books and film, in\nthe digital age.\n\n   ``The entertainment community is a lot more concerned about\n(piracy) because they see their traditional strength _ their\nstranglehold on distribution _ evaporating,'' said Eric Doney, a\nMarin attorney who has specialized in intellectual property issues\nfor the software industry since the 1980s.\n\n   The MPAA, the DVD Copy Control Association and the Recording\nIndustry Association of America have been involved in a flurry of\ncourt activity in the past two months that highlight some of the\nchanging forces at work.\n\n   In December, Morgan Hill's DVD Copy Control Association sued 99\nhackers and Web site operators for posting the code to a free\nsoftware program called De-CSS, which can be used to unlock the\nprogram that scrambles movies recorded on DVDs, or digital\nversatile discs.\n\n   The DVD association alleged the descrambling code amounted to\ntheft of its intellectual property, a DVD Content Scrambling\nSystem, or DVD CSS, devised to make it difficult, although not\nimpossible, to make illegal copies of movies recorded on DVD. The\ncode was crucial for the DVD industry to convince major film\nstudios to trust putting their movies in that format.\n\n   The De-CSS code was originally posted on the Web in October by\nNorwegian teenager Jon Johansen and a group called the Masters of\nReverse Engineering and picked up by thousands of Web sites\nworldwide. Norwegian authorities last week raided the 16-year-old\nJohansen's home and confiscated his personal computers, some disks\nand a mobile phone, according to press reports from Norway.\n\n   The De-CSS code, the author of which is still unknown, allows\nusers of the Linux computer operating system to play back DVDs on\ntheir machines. Linux supporters say they had no choice but to hack\nbecause the DVD industry has only licensed devices that play back\nDVDs on machines using Windows or Macintosh operating systems, but\nrefuse to support alternatives like Linux because the market is\nstill too small.\n\n   The showdown continues, as the DVD Copy Control Association said\nits code is available for license to anyone wishing to produce a\nLinux DVD player, but no one has applied. The MPAA, meanwhile,\ncontends that no matter what, the hackers simply broke the law when\nthey broke the code.\n\n   McGuire, whose online civil liberties group has stepped in to\nhelp fight the suits, said the 1998 federal Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act, which allows programmers to legally reverse engineer\nsoftware to make them more useful, allows the action.\n\n   ``There's not a single example of anyone doing anything remotely\nlike piracy here,'' McGuire said.\n\n   And he said posting the code on the Web was no different than\nwriting and posting a good poem.\n\n   ``This is the fundamental component of the way open systems\nsoftware is created, designed and improved. If this kind of\nactivity had been made illegal, Linux might not be around today,''\nhe said.\n\n   On January 21, Santa Clara County Judge William J. Elfving\nissued a preliminary injunction of 21 defendants named in the suit\nto stop posting the De-CSS code.\n\n   Just a day earlier, a New York judge issued an injunction in a\nsimilar lawsuit the MPAA filed against three Web site operators in\nNew York and Connecticut who also posted the De-CSS code.\n\n   And on the same day, the MPAA joined the four major U.S. TV\nbroadcast networks and two professional sports leagues in a suit to\nblock a Canadian Web site, iCraveTV.com, from retransmitting\nover-the-air broadcasts of TV shows and movies through the\nInternet.\n\n   Meanwhile, the record industry, which has been struggling for\ntwo years with the widespread digital copying and distribution of\nsongs on the Internet spurred by the MP3 revolution, got into the\nact.\n\n   The Recording Industry Association of America filed a copyright\ninfringement suit in New York against MP3.com. The complaint claims\na new service that allows users to instantly hear music from the\nSan Diego Web site and add their personal music to a playlist for\nothers was a copyright infringement, a charge MP3.com refutes.\n\n   The RIAA also went to court in December to sue a small San Mateo\nonline company called Napster, which the group claims ``facilitates\nmusic piracy'' by allowing millions of people to share and swap\ndigital songs with each other over the Internet.\n\n   The stakes are already huge for the worldwide recording\nindustry, which claims counterfeit CDs and illegally downloaded\nsongs cost them $4.5 billion each year in lost revenue.\n\n   The movie industry doesn't face as immediate a threat from\ndigital piracy, although it estimates the losses from pirated VHS\nmovies amount to about $3 billion a year. Valenti said bootleg\ncopies of first-run films like ``Toy Story II,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut''\nand ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' were available even before\nthey were released in theaters. Copies of ``Phantom Menace'' were\non as many as 400 Web sites when the movie first came out last\nsummer.\n\n   For now, there are several barriers to making a DVD copy. For\none thing, a DVD disc holds about 5.2 gigabytes of data, an\nimpractical amount for most home computer users to copy, and it\nwould take about 40 hours to download the same data off the\nInternet using a 56-Kbps modem.\n\n   And the price of a writable DVD disc is still about $50 each,\nabout twice the cost of buying a prerecorded DVD movie. Consumer\nelectronic companies Samsung and Panasonic have announced plans to\nintroduce DVD recorders later this year, but the units will cost at\nleast $2,000.\n\n   But those barriers could fall over time with the increase of\nhigh-speed Internet cable and DSL services and digital satellite\nservices. The movie industry itself is slowly moving toward the day\nwhen instead of shipping analog film on reels, studios beam\nfirst-run movies digitally to theaters. Experts say this will\ninevitably spur some hacker to devise a method of tapping into\nthose transmissions.\n\n   Valenti recently told a congressional subcommittee that with\nfuture methods of digital recording and transmission, ``our\nramparts are being breached on all sides.''\n\n   Legal experts say the outcomes of the current flurry of court\nsuits will go a long way in shaping consumer entertainment of the\nfuture.\n\n   But as the recording industry has found with the spread of\nMP3-formatted songs, trying to stop every digital bootleg movie or\nsong on the vast World Wide Web will be virtually impossible.\n\n   ``The idea that they can absolutely control distribution\noverstates their solutions,'' said attorney Eric Doney, of Donahue,\nGallagher, Woods & Wood in Oakland.\n\n   The movie and recording industries instead are taking the path\nset by software companies, which fight piracy through a combination\nof consumer education and selective enforcement.\n\n   ``They're educating the public on what is right and what is\nwrong,'' Doney said. ``They're combining enforcement as the stick\nand the carrot of education, and in general, it's worked.''\n\n   And software companies have worked to improve their wares so\nthat consumers are inclined to buy legitimate software that comes\nwith support and upgrades, rather than using bootleg copies that\nmay crash.\n\n   Changing consumer perception of copied digital music or movies\nmay prove more challenging than with software, however. Unlike\ncopying a VHS tape, the 100th digital copy of a song or movie is\njust as good as the original, and there are no support issues.\n``They've got to do something to make their original product\nsomething that's not easily matched on the outside'' in pirated\nversions, Doney said.\n\n   Jon Garon, a professor of entertainment law at the Western State\nUniversity College of Law in Fullerton, said the movie industry is\nusing digital piracy as ``a rallying cry'' that is more show than\nsubstance. But he said the industry needs to start embracing the\ntechnology soon or get left behind in the stampede.\n\n   The major record labels are already moving quickly to control\nInternet music distribution. The biggest example is the recent\nmerger agreement between record giant EMI and Time Warner, which\nitself is merging with Internet powerhouse America Online.\n\n   ``I don't think the majority of the studios recognize where the\nindustry could head,'' Garon said.\n\n   There are signs the studios are waking up. This month,\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Blockbuster agreed to develop and test a\nway to make MGM's movies available for download into homes via\nBlockbuster's Internet site.\n\n   Lea Porteneuve, MGM's corporate communications director, said\nthe two companies have not figured how to make digital movie\ndownloading work, but ``the great hope is that we have something to\nshow by year's end.''\n\n   ``I don't know if the entertainment industry will ever be able\nto get their arms around piracy completely,'' Porteneuve said.\n``It's the same with films and video and any other forms of\nentertainment products; it's always been the subject of piracy.\nIt's a matter of us doing our best to circumvent that piracy.''\n\n   Valenti said he's not opposed to the coming new digital world.\n\n   ``But if we're going to have films borne by some digital\ndelivery system, like the Internet or cable or satellite, it has to\nbe protected from those who would steal it,'' he said. ``That's a\nsimple declaration.''\n","Headline":"\nMOVIE, MUSIC INDUSTRIES TAKE ON DIGITAL DUPES  \n  \n","Text":["\n   The head of the Motion Picture Association of America sees a new\ngang of digital outlaws a-ridin' in, bent on pillaging his town _\nHollywood.
