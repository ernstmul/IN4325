It simply is part of the seascape with the\nfish and the gulls. That's the point.\n\n   Over the years, discriminating folk have bought lobster boats as\npleasure craft for their seaworthiness and spare lines. They\nappreciate the marriage of form with function and prize the economy\nof design.\n\n   There is a rich vein of reverse snobbery at work here. By and\nlarge, this has been a sailing crowd who race with skill and cruise\nwith intimacy off the coast they adore. Their disdain for\n``stinkpots'' runs deep. Eventually, though, they ease off sail for\nthe comfort of motor. But it had better look good.\n\n   ``They're not banana-shaped, futuristic-looking things,'' Bruce\nCunningham, owner of Padebco Custom Boats in Round Pond, says about\nlobster boats. ``They're a real boat that looks like a real boat.''\n\n   Due to the vagaries of vogue and the torrents of new money, the\nsecret of the lobster boat is out among the greater public. The\n``lobster yacht'' market is booming in boatyards up and down the\nMaine coast that sell to clients from the Pacific Northwest to the\nGreat Lakes and down to Florida. Their boats pop up in Italy and\nthe Galapagos.\n\n   ``The market has just exploded with the fiberglass hulls,'' says\nLee Wilbur, a veteran builder in Southwest Harbor. ``The demand for\nMaine lobster yachts seems to increase every year.''\n\n   In addition to their traditional owners, the boats have\nattracted freshly minted millionaires who don't know much except\nthat they should have one _ often subtly sumptuous affairs that\nsell for half a million dollars or more. Ranging from about 20 to\nmore than 40 feet, they are superb for island-hopping, martinis at\nsunset, or fishing offshore in a rolling sea.\n\n   Purists bemoan the use of fiberglass in hulls and amenities such\nas air conditioning and microwave ovens, but builders just beam and\nscour the area for skilled workers to meet the demand. A\nprospective buyer can wait a year or longer.\n\n   Just what accounts for this hot market?\n\n   ``What makes a Land Rover special?'' answers Donnie Ellis, a\nsecond-generation builder in Southwest Harbor. ``You use it for\nyears in deserts and jungles. You beat the hell out of it and can't\nkill it. Same thing with these boats. Commercial fishermen have to\ngo out in them or they starve.''\n\n   One reason is that the Down East hull puts a lot of boat under\nthe waterline. This does wonders for stability. Glenn Holland, a\nbuilder out of Belfast, estimates that the waterline length of his\n38-footer, Spare Parts, is about 37 feet. This is a far cry from\nthe Ray Hunt-designed deep-V hulls in most power boats, which leave\nless of the boat in the water for speed.\n\n   There is even a summer lobster boat racing circuit in Maine.\nThese are torrid affairs, drag races on water where boats top 50\nknots for a flat-out run of about a mile. Yachts, these are not.\nWe're talking working boats stripped for speed, some of which pack\nengines upwards of 1,000 horsepower that drink racing fuel and make\nso much noise that crew members don headphones to keep their\nhearing.\n\n   ``Otherwise you'd be deaf as a flounder,'' observes Holland,\nwhose 32-foot Red Baron has been the scourge of the unlimited\ngasoline class this year.\n\n   The pursuit of speed extends beyond the racing circuit and\npermeates the entire lobster yacht market. The engines are bigger\nthan ever, producing top speeds close to 30 knots. Where 200\nhorsepower was once the norm, today lobster yachts routinely top\n400 and can cruise at more than 20 knots.\n\n   Jerry Lynch, who is on his fourth Wilbur boat, has an\n800-horsepower engine on his 38-footer. ``I'll admit to 900,''\nHolland says.\n\n   Constellations of lobster yacht builders dot the Maine coast.\nYou've got the Beal clan all over Beals Island and Jonesport. One\nof the biggest hubs is Southwest Harbor, where Chester Clement\nbegan building lobster boats in the 1930s, followed by the\nmemorable team of Raymond Bunker and Ralph Ellis, and then Ralph\nStanley.\n\n   Today, Ellis's son, Donnie, continues the family tradition,\nalbeit in fiberglass, down the road from Wilbur. They are joined by\na handful of other builders in the area. Stanley is still building\nin wood. At 71, he is the dean of the wooden boat builders in the\narea and has been honored by the National Endowment for the Arts\nfor his skills.\n\n   It's a tight breed. Donnie Ellis's mother was a Beal. His father\ndesigned a hull for Wilbur, and his brother was in business with\nWilbur for a while. So if a prospective client chooses Wilbur over\nhim, Ellis can live with it. ``It's still part of the family,'' he\nsays.\n\n   Such largesse does not extend to Hinckley Co., the giant\nboatyard a quarter-mile from the Ellis yard. Hinckley has\nrevolutionized _ some say adulterated _ the lobster yacht market\nwith its wildly popular Picnic Boat (a Hinckley trademark name that\nWilbur says he and others used informally for years).\n\n   The Picnic is a 36-foot confection of Kevlar, fiberglass, and\ncarbon _ usually powered by a 420-horsepower jet engine _ that\nmaneuvers like a quarterhorse. It has a mere 18-inch draft. The jet\nallows it to skim over lobster pots that are snagged in the\npropellers of traditional lobster boats.\n\n   A bowthruster, a small propeller located in the bow to ease the\nembarrassment of docking for the neophyte, is standard. (They are\nincreasingly popular in other lobster yachts as well.) Like the\nboats of Ellis and Wilbur, they are studies in teak, mahogany, and\ncherry.\n\n   Philip Bennett, Hinckley's director of sales and marketing,\nlikens the lobster yacht craze to the mushrooming sport utility\nvehicle market: ``SUVs are trucks with creature comforts.'' Lobster\nyachts, in turn, are commercial boats with stuffing.\n\n   Lobster yacht chic, he says, is a result of evaporating leisure\ntime in the United States. ``Someone promised us more free time and\npaper-free offices. It didn't happen,'' he says. ``With less time,\npeople want to get out on the water faster. This is simpler than\nsailing.''\n\n   Traditionalists concede the Picnic is easy on the eye, but they\nmaintain its light weight _ 11,000 pounds _ and relatively narrow\nbeam provide for an unamusing experience when the wind blows hard.\nAnd they howl at the gall of Hinckley to call it a lobster yacht in\nthe first place. Its bloodlines, they say, lie elsewhere.\n\n   ``It is not a lobster boat model,'' Stanley says. Adds Wilbur:\n``It is absolutely different. It has more relevance to the old Gar\nWood, Chris-Craft-type bottom.''\n\n   And it attracts a different kind of buyer, often a first-time\nowner with little water experience.\n\n   Officials at Hinckley, whose high-performance sailboats are\nrecognized throughout the world, could care less. The company makes\nabout 40 Picnic Boats a year at $400,000 a pop, and people get in\nline to buy one. It has sold 178 since the model first appeared in\n1994. A new 44-foot model, the Talaria, boasts double jet engines,\na top speed of 32 knots, and myriad amenities for about $1 million.\n\n   Hinckley defends the performance of its Picnic in heavy weather\nby arguing that width alone does not determine stability. ``People\nsay you need a wide hull to be stable,'' Bennett says. ``But if you\nhave a low center of gravity, you get the same effect.'' Bennett\nadds that the Picnic engine is mounted very low, creating\nstability.\n\n   At its core, the complaint against Hinckley's lobster yachts is\nless about seaworthiness than the damage done to the ethos of\ncustom boat building in Maine, the soul of small yards. ``They've\npractically got them on the shelf,'' Stanley says.\n\n   But the range of lobster boats being built these days is\nstriking. Indeed, it is an aesthetic stretch from Stanley's spare\nwooden confections to the fuller fiberglass boats of Ellis and\nWilbur and on to the glitz and technology of Hinckley. There has\nbeen enough business for all concerned, but Ellis, for one, worries\nabout a recession.\n\n   ``This is a false economy,'' he says. ``I lost $750,000 with the\ndrop in the Nasdaq last spring. I had two guys who wrote out checks\nand then had to call up and ask for them back.''\n\n   With the Hinckley assembly line in high gear, Stanley remains a\nmagnificent dinosaur across the harbor. He disdains what he\nconsiders the bloated look of the newer lobster yachts and despises\nfiberglass. ``The pleasure boats are out of balance. There's too\nmuch stuff in them,'' he says. ``That's why they've made them so\nwide. But they don't handle well.''\n\n   And he minces no words about fiberglass: ``I don't like the\nsmell of it. I don't like the itch of it. And you build the same\ndamned thing over and over.''\n\n   Stanley doesn't even like the term ``lobster yacht.'' ``It's\neither a yacht or a boat,'' he snaps.\n\n   Either way, lobster boats continue to seduce with their long,\nlean looks.\n\n   ``I'm enthralled by them,'' says Tom Ewens, a philosophy\nprofessor at the Rhode Island School of Design who fell in love\nwith a 36-foot Harold Gower boat and bought it two years ago. It\nneeded a lot of work and has eaten a lot of money.\n\n   ``These are not perfectly rational decisions,'' he concedes.\n","Headline":"\n888-603-1036.)  \n THE FASHIONABLE ARE HOOKED ON HARDY LOBSTER BOATS \n","Text":["\n   SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine _ Like a good barn, a Down East lobster\nboat looks better the longer you eyeball it.\n","\n   The thing does not take your breath away like a Friendship sloop\nor a Concordia yawl.
