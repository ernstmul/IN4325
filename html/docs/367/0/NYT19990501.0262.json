He said he had ``no idea, none'' as to why the boat sank.\n\n   Watching the rescue effort from the shore early Saturday\nafternoon was a boy who had been on the boat with his parents and\nsister, who were unaccounted for. The police did not want to\nidentify the boy until the fate of his family could be determined.\nThe sheriff said none of the dead would be identified until Sunday.\n\n   ``I was scared, wondering what was going to happen,'' the boy\nsaid. ``I just remember going out the window at the top. I couldn't\nfind my parents or my sister. The boat started going down. The\nwhole thing was under in 30 seconds.'' he said.\n\n   Divers said the boat came to rest on its wheels in about 60 feet\nof water.
