Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ When Raymond Gniewek was appointed concertmaster of\nthe Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in 1957, he was a 25-year-old\ngraduate of the Eastman School of Music with scant experience in\nvocal music, let alone opera. Though he was a brilliantly talented\nviolinist, he immediately became the youngest member of the\norchestra, its first American-born concertmaster, and he was\nexpected to assume a leadership role among musicians far more\nknowledgeable than he about the European opera heritage.\n\n   Things obviously turned out well. After 43 years as\nconcertmaster _ a position little understood even by regular\nconcertgoers _ Gniewek, 68, is retiring. During his tenure he has\nperformed in 115 different operas under a roster of conductors\nranging from some now-forgotten beat-keepers to giants like Dmitri\nMitropoulos, Karl Boehm, Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein\nand, of course, James Levine. An opera neophyte when he arrived, he\nleaves with an incomparable understanding of operatic style and\npractice. In 1977 he even married a singer, the soprano Judith\nBlegen.\n\n   His final performances come this weekend with two concerts by\nthe Met Orchestra conducted by Levine: Friday night at the New\nJersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, and on Sunday afternoon at\nCarnegie Hall, an all-Bartok program offering the one-act opera\n``Bluebeard's Castle'' and the Concerto for Orchestra. Count on\nLevine, who was a precocious 13-year-old piano student in\nCincinnati when Gniewek got the Met job, to acknowledge him warmly\nat the end of the concert.\n\n   During an interview the other day in his office, Levine grew\nemotional trying to explain how important Gniewek has been to the\nartistic growth of the orchestra. They share a musical heritage,\nsince two of Levine's teachers, the conductors Jean Morel and\nFausto Cleva, were important figures at the Met during Gniewek's\nearly years. ``The single luckiest thing to happen to me since I\nhave been at the Met,'' Levine said, ``is that Ray Gniewek was the\nconcertmaster.''\n\n   Many operagoers will have to accept Levine's tribute on faith,\nsince there are such misconceptions about the role. What exactly\ndoes a concertmaster do?\n\n   ``It's hard to put into words,'' the silver-haired, fit and\naffable Gniewek said during a recent interview at the Met. In the\n18th century, ``before conductors were even around,'' he said,\n``the concertmaster essentially led the orchestra, for the simple\nreason that the violin was the highest voice in any ensemble.''\n\n   He continued: ``As music became more complicated, and more\ninstruments were involved, communication between the musicians\ndidn't work very well. So a director, a conductor, was put there,\nto keep things in order.''\n\n   This outmoded historic conception of the concertmaster as a sort\nof second in command, ready to assume the podium if the conductor\nshould be unable to continue, has persisted in the public\nimagination, Gniewek said. But all major orchestras have a number\nof assistant conductors on staff. The Met has a whole roster of\nthem.\n\n   Like most modern concertmasters, Gniewek has a different set of\nresponsibilities. The public notices his work most when he plays\nsolos in an opera. These can range in length and difficulty from\nthe short, bittersweet melody that comforts Strauss' introspective\nMarschallin at the end of Act I in ``Der Rosenkavalier'' to the\nminiconcerto that functions as an orchestral interlude in Act III\nof Verdi's ``I Lombardi.''\n\n   More important, he acts as a leader of the violin section,\nresponsible for making sure that all phrasing, bowings and\narticulations are being done the same way by everyone. In a house\nwith the heritage of the Met, such solutions have long been\nestablished and are written into the orchestra parts. But a\nconductor is free to change them. In that case the concertmaster\nmust find a technical solution to the conductor's wishes and\ncommunicate it somehow to the other musicians.\n\n   ``Players tell me all the time, `Don't worry, Ray, we're\nwatching the tip of your bow,''' Gniewek said. But many things have\nto be dealt with in detail, on the spot, in rehearsal:\n\n   ``For example, Jimmy will say, `No, Ray, I want this phrase a\nlittle lighter, a little shorter.' So I'll play it. He'll say: `No,\nthat's too short. Just a little brushing sound, tat-tat-tat.' I'll\nplay again. `That's it!' he'll say. So I turn to the violins and\ndemonstrate. It's my job to make technical translations of the\ndesired sound. And you have to show, not tell, because the same\nwords can mean different things to different people.''\n\n   This intuitive way of working has been essential to Levine,\nwhose goal has been to make the Met orchestra sound ``like a\nsensational, huge chamber group.'' This is critical in opera, where\ntiming should be free and expressive, and where, ideally, the\nconductor and orchestra respond to the singers the way a pianist\naccompanies a voice recital.\n\n   Sometimes, when a conductor is waiting on a singer's response,\nGniewek said, ``there is a lag between them, between what is\nhappening onstage and what is happening in the pit.'' If there is\nany uncertainty, the orchestra players ``feel a little surer if\nthey can follow me,'' he said. ``I mean, I make a sound. The\nconductor's beat doesn't. So if they jump in when I start to play,\nthey know they will be safe.''\n\n   nn\n\n   Â \n\n   Some modern-day concertmasters have also been aspiring\nconductors, the most renowned example being Joseph Silverstein, who\nresigned as concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1984\nafter 22 years to become the conductor of the Utah Symphony\nOrchestra. Gniewek ``never had the itch'' to conduct, he said.\n``I'd rather play. I have strong feelings about sound, the actual\nact of playing of the instrument. It's what I do best.''\n\n   He certainly must have done it impressively to win his post at\nsuch a young age, especially considering that his focus on a\nmusical career came late. He was born in East Meadow, on Long\nIsland, to a mother who loved music and sang in a church choir, and\na Polish immigrant father who had played the violin at dances in\nPoland but wound up working as a barber in America.\n\n   ``The family joke was that my parents' first son was going to be\na violinist,'' Gniewek said. Coming after two sisters, he was the\nfirst son. He became the violinist. ``I had no choice,'' he said\nwryly. ``I never really took to practicing too well. I loved math\nand science.''\n\n   He intended to be a physics major and was accepted by the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. But he was persuaded to\nattend the University of Rochester, where, somehow, he said, he\nwound up enrolling at the affiliated Eastman School of Music. Erich\nLeinsdorf, who had been conducting at the Met since 1938, was the\ndirector of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra at the time and\ninvited Gniewek to be its concertmaster. But it was the conductor\nMax Rudolf, then an assistant manager at the Met, who worked with\nGniewek in Rochester and told him of the opening at the Met.\n\n   The concertmaster appointment came at a difficult time in\nGniewek's life. His first marriage, which produced two daughters,\nwas breaking up. ``I was 20 when we got married,'' he said. ``We\nwere just too young.''\n\n   The Met musicians might have been expected to be resentful of\nthis young newcomer. But, Gniewek said, ``I sort of waded my way\nthrough things, wasn't too arrogant, and the musicians were very\nsupportive.''\n\n   Surely he earned that support through the quality of his\nmusicianship. Today, after four decades of absorbing operatic\nstyle, his playing has a special vocal quality, Levine said: ``It\nshimmers, it's lyrical. You can imagine putting a text to it\nimmediately.''\n\n   When Gniewek joined the Met, the autocratic Rudolf Bing was in\nhis seventh year as general manager. However Bing's tenure is\nregarded today, he was ``a singer's man,'' Gniewek said. ``To him,\nwe were just an accompanying orchestra.''\n\n   He remembers Levine's 1971 debut as a turning point. ``When\nJimmy came, it was the end of the season, just another `Tosca' for\nus,'' Gniewek recalled. ``But he really lifted us up and carried us\nalong. Afterward I did something I didn't do much. I found him\nbackstage and said, `That was the most phenomenal debut since\nHerbert von Karajan.'''\n\n   The morale in the orchestra, in that next-to-last year of the\nBing era, was not high. Levine's positivism was just the tonic\nneeded, Gniewek said. He sometimes chides jaded friends from the\nNew York Philharmonic who are suspicious of Levine's enthusiasm.\n\n   ``They tell me, `Ah, he's always smiling.'\n\n   ` `What's wrong with that?' I say. `You have to always make\nmusic scowling? Music always has to be done with suffering and\nintensity?'''\n\n   There have been times when Gniewek was so exhilarated after a\nMet performance _ many nights with Birgit Nilsson and Renata\nTebaldi, he said, and Wagner's ``Ring'' with Levine _ that he would\ngo home and stay up until 4 a.m. doing things like tiling the\nbathroom floor. He would have retired years ago, he said, but he\nwanted to be a part of two transforming additions to the\norchestra's musical life introduced by Levine over the last 10\nyears: the Met Orchestra concert series and the founding of the Met\nChamber Ensemble.\n\n   During his tenure Gniewek has witnessed a turnover of orchestra\npersonnel; only three players have been there longer than he.\nNaturally, he was very involved with the auditions for string\nplayers, though he said he was ``not 100 percent happy'' with the\nprocess. To prevent discrimination, the candidates play from behind\na screen, and the musicians on the audition committee write down\ntheir comments without consultation.\n\n   ``I would like to have a little discussion,'' he said.\n``Sometimes you don't completely trust what you are hearing.'' For\nexample, was a violinist's playing exciting, or a bit aggressive?\nDifferent listeners may feel differently. Also, although he accepts\nthe reasons for it, he has been frustrated by the use of the\nscreen.\n\n   ``I like to see a person playing,'' he said. ``Playing an\ninstrument is a very physical thing.'' If there are problems after\nthe fact, the contract allows for a two-year probation period\nduring which a newcomer can be removed.\n\n   Only the concertmaster can be appointed directly by the artistic\ndirector, Levine. The Met orchestra has traditionally had two\nprincipal players of each instrument, but only one concertmaster,\nthough there are several associates. Levine has been seeking to\nchange that policy, and over the last season a second\nconcertmaster, Nick Eanet, 28, whom everyone is excited about, was\nfinally broken in. Gniewek is now taking part in the audition\nprocess to find another concertmaster to share the work with Eanet.\n\n   Gniewek knows that playing in an opera house orchestra involves\na lot of hard, routine work, day after day. But he always had an\nanswer for musicians who found themselves feeling uninspired.\n\n   ``I'd tell people: `You are going to be here for four hours\nanyway. Do you want to walk out feeling: ``Ugh! What a headache!\nThat was not so good''? Or do you want to walk out feeling, ``Wow,\nthat was fantastic'' '? Might as well give it everything.''\n\n   And that explains exactly what a concertmaster does.
