I think of it as\nPC envy. People who have relatively low-powered computers at home\nspend a huge amount of time fretting they don't have a powerful\nenough computer. After all, they're bombarded with ads and articles\nthat discuss the merits of having a super computer.\n\n   This morning's e-mail brought me a note from a reader who uses\nan old Mac Classic computer. She said she was really happy with it\nand wondered if she should buy a new iMac.\n\n   The answer isn't exactly what you might think. There's nothing\nwrong with replacing an old computer, even one you're happy with,\nbecause newer and more powerful computers do things faster (that's\nconvenient and less frustrating) and can run more-powerful programs\n(some of the best new programs won't run on old machines).\n\n   If you have plenty of money and want a new computer, then there\nare good reasons for buying one. But if you are one of those people\nwho have to count pennies, and who have to make decisions between\nbuying a new computer and going to New Orleans on vacation, or\npaying the mortgage, then don't feel blue or compelled to buy just\nbecause you have this vague notion that you need more.\n\n   Among my power-hungry friends, the most common uses for a home\ncomputer (besides games, and we'll get to that by and by) are\ne-mail, using the Web, writing old-fashioned paper letters and\nrunning Quicken or some other money management program. It doesn't\ntake a super computer to do all that. And if the machine you have\nat home now does it all for you, then you won't hurt yourself in\nwaiting.\n\n   Here comes Husted's Rule of Computer Replacement: Unless you\nhave plenty of money to spare, only buy a new machine when the one\nyou own won't run a program you truly need to use, or when it runs\nthe program so slowly you just about can't stand it (put in\nscientific terms).\n\n   The benefit of following that rule is that you're taking\nadvantage of a computer world truth: The computers on sale next\nmonth are always more powerful and cost less than the ones last\nmonth. So, when you do buy, you'll get the very most bang for your\nbuck.\n\n   OK. I said I would come back to the topic of games.\n\n   If playing computer games is a big part of your computing life\n(and it isn't necessarily a sin to actually have fun with that\nexpensive piece of hardware that sits ugly and beige on your desk\nat home), then Husted's Rule still holds true. But you will find\nthe games you most want to play require enormous computing power.\nAnd the demands from the games don't stop there.\n\n   You'll soon find out that games push every component. That\ndesigners _ stretching to get the most realistic video and the most\npowerful sound _ write the games with rich folks in mind. You'll\nfind the latest video card is important to the hottest games and,\nif you want to hear the crunching sound just right when the Alien\nCreature From the Third Grade eats your hero, you'll need a hot\nsound card and the latest in speakers.\n\n   There is one small gleam of hope, however, that I can offer even\nthe game players in the crowd. In a calculated way, I stay two\ngenerations behind on the games I play. That way, I save money\ntwice. I find games that are new to me in the bargain bin at the\nsoftware store, and I also postpone the day when I enrich the\ncredit card people by dropping big money on a new machine.\n\n   E-mail: tecbud(at)ajc.com\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ You'd think _ judging from the computers my friends\nown _ that many people of my personal acquaintance are spending\ntheir evenings designing nuclear submarines and figuring ways to\ncontrol the Hubble Space Telescope from home.\n","\n   It's created a weird sort of modern neurosis.
