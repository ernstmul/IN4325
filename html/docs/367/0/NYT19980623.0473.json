Times News Service   \n\n   SHANGHAI, China _ Accustomed to putting its best face forward\nfor an important guest, China is cleaning itself up for President\nClinton's arrival on Thursday.\n\n   Not only are roads being repaved, buildings whitewashed and\nentrance ways decorated on countless routes where the president is\nexpected to travel during his nine days in China, but the\nauthorities are also cracking down on many of the illegal\nactivities that are ordinarily tolerated these days, like the sale\nof pirated video and music compact disks.\n\n   The fight against piracy of software, music and movies, an issue\nthat loomed large in American-Chinese relations a few years ago,\nhas been pushed into the background and is unlikely to be raised\nseriously during Clinton's visit, even though it remains as rampant\na problem as ever.\n\n   An explosion in the video compact disk industry in China in the\nlast two years has created an enormous demand for cheap videos, and\npirated versions have been openly advertised and sold in cities all\nover China.\n\n   The boom in video compact disks _ ``Titanic'' was sold on\nShanghai street corners for $2, even before the film's theatrical\nrelease in the United States in December _ seemed to signal a\nfailure of a 1995 agreement between the United States and China\nthat promised strict enforcement against both producers and\nsellers.\n\n   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative who\nnegotiated the agreement in 1995, tried to deflect such concern\nwhen she met with reporters in Beijing last week. She expressed\napproval of Beijing's efforts to crack down on producers of\nillegally copied disks and cited a laundry list of numbers: 69\nillegal producers shut down, more than 800 arrests, countless\nmaster tapes destroyed.\n\n   Ms. Barshefsky even argued that China had ceased to be a\nhigh-scale exporter of pirated goods, moving way down the list of\noffending countries.\n\n   ``We have a far bigger problem now with Italy,'' she said.\n\n   But industry experts who follow the situation closely say the\nonly real change is that the pirates, many of them Taiwan\nbusinessmen with histories of organized crime, have moved their\noperations from the Chinese mainland to Macao, the Portuguese\ncolony scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1999. The pirates\ncontinue to export from Macao, both to Southeast Asia and even more\ninto China, where demand remains the strongest.\n\n   The International Federation of Phonographic Industries, by far\nthe best-informed among trade groups monitoring piracy in China,\nestimated that in the first half of this year an average of 500,000\nillegally copied video compact disks were smuggled back into China\nfrom Macao each day, or roughly 15 million disks a month.\n\n   Video compact disks, the same size as audio compact disks,\ntypically contain up to 70 minutes of a movie, often requiring two\ndisks for a Hollywood feature. In China, video cassettes are\nrapidly disappearing, and video compact disk players that cost\nabout $100 have become a staple of virtually any Chinese family\nwith disposable income.\n\n   So while Chinese and American officials are each claiming\nvictory in rooting out pirates, more illegally copied material is\non sale in China than ever before. And until the recent crackdown,\ntemporary or not, it appeared as if the Chinese authorities had\naltogether abandoned efforts to stop the sale of illegal disks.\n\n   Until this month, that is. The current crackdown may wear off in\na cycle, as previous crackdowns have, but last week the authorities\nin several Chinese cities brought out bulldozers to destroy\nmillions of pirated video compact disks, in yet another effort to\nshow they meant business.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
