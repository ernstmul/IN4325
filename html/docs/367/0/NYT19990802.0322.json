Times News Service   \n\n   NEWARK, N.J. _ A routine investigation into cable television\npiracy has evolved into an exploration of the secret world of\noff-shore money laundering, giving investigators what one agent\ncalled an unprecedented insight into banking in the Cayman Islands.\n\n   In a court appearance Monday, federal prosecutors said records\nthey had obtained from a defunct Cayman Island's bank had sparked\ninvestigations involving 1,500 people that could eventually net\nmore than $300 million in unpaid taxes and penalties.\n\n   Federal prosecutors, IRS officials and FBI agents said Monday\nthat the case has already helped them penetrate the veil of secrecy\nthat one prosecutor said has ``been one of the greatest allies of\nindividuals committing crimes in this country.''\n\n   The revelations came at the sentencing Monday of John Mathewson,\na U.S. citizen who once offered his Cayman Island bank as a\none-stop money launderer. He was charged with money laundering in\nthe cable television case and gave prosecutors records from his\nbank as part of a plea bargain.\n\n   Already some $50 million in back taxes and penalties has been\nrecovered as a result of Mathewson's help to prosecutors in seven\nfederal judicial districts, said John J. Carney, an assistant U.S.\nattorney who prosecuted the cable box case.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   In court, Carney had dozens of letters and documents from\nprosecutors detailing some of the criminal cases that have resulted\nfrom Mathewson's bank records: Dr. Jeffrey E. LaVigne, the New York\nproctologist who once advertised his practice on subway posters\n(1-800-MD-TUSCH), has been charged with using the bank to evade\ntaxes on $187,667 in income; Mark Vicini, a New Jersey millionaire\nwho owned a computer company, Micro Rentals and Sales, and who\nadmitted putting $9 million in Mathewson's bank to avoid $2 million\nin taxes; members of the Abboud family in Omaha, Neb., who were\nindicted in May on tax and other fraud charges for allegedly\nfunneling some $27 million into the bank from cable piracy schemes.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   ``His is the most important cooperation for the government in\nthe history of tax haven prosecution,'' said Carney, who is in the\nfederal prosecutor's Fraud and Public Protection division in New\nJersey. ``That is in terms of the complexity of the scheme, the\nnumber of dollars involved and the number of people.''\n\n   Carney and Robert J. Jordan, in charge of the FBI's Newark\noffice, said that the case had seriously damaged the banking\nsecrecy that had helped the Cayman Islands become the fifth-largest\nbanking center in the world.\n\n   The Cayman government had unsuccessfully gone into U.S. courts\nto try to retrieve copies of computerized tapes of bank\ntransactions that Mathewson had kept and to block disclosure of\nother information. The government had also refused to assist FBI\nofficials in decoding the computer records. Without the Cayman\ngovernment's missing part of the code, it took 18 months to be able\nto read the files.\n\n   Jordan said that, to his knowledge, this was the first time that\na U.S. law enforcement agency had gotten such detailed information\nabout the dealings of a Cayman bank. ``The Caymans is no longer the\nsafe haven that they were,'' he said, ``because we have gotten our\nnose in the tent and seen how it works.''\n\n   At his sentencing Monday, Mathewson, who offered his cooperation\nimmediately on the night that FBI investigators arrested him for\nhelping the cable pirates launder and hide profits, delivered a\nlong autobiographical statement detailing his role in the crimes.\nHe finished up by repeating the creed by which he had lived his\nlife: ``Yes, sir, no sir, no excuses sir.''\n\n   ``I have no excuse for what I did in aiding U.S. citizens to\nevade taxes and the fact that every other bank in the Caymans was\ndoing it is no excuse,'' he said. ``But I have cooperated and if\nGuardian Bank and Trust had been a sting operation and I an FBI\nagent, it could not have been more effective.''\n\n   Mathewson's cooperation began in mid-1996, after he had left\nGuardian Bank and Trust and moved with his Caymanian wife and three\nchildren to San Antonio, Texas. FBI agents in Newark came upon his\nname through wiretaps in connection with a then two-year-old\nundercover sting operation aimed at the traffic in illegally\noutfitted cable television decoder boxes, estimated by the National\nCable Television Association to cost up to $7 billion a year.\n\n   What was already a tantalizing prosecution that featured\nhigh-tech industrial espionage, a bribe in the form of a $40,000\nPorche and strong hints of swaggering south Florida ``wiseguys''\nsaid to be part of the Luchese crime family, suddenly became a high\nstakes international dispute. Once Mathewson had been caught\nlaundering money for the cable ring leaders, he volunteered to give\nthe arresting agents the computer tapes. He also offered them his\nown ``electronic Rolodex'' that told him which individuals were\nconnected with the hundreds of ``shelf corporations'' he had set up\nfor the bank's customers.\n\n   ``It all started from very humble beginnings,'' said Jordan, the\nFBI agent, ``but we looked to maximize things.''\n\n   While the four-year cable piracy investigation netted 25\nindictments and closed down $40 million-a-year operations in\nFlorida, New Jersey and California, the motherlode from Mathewson's\nrecords keeps on producing.\n\n   nn\n\n   Mathewson, 71, was once a wealthy construction company owner and\nexecutive in the Chicago area. He moved to the Caymans in\n``semiretirement'' in 1982, and along with some local business\npeople, set up the Guardian Bank and Trust Co. in 1986. He said in\ncourt Monday that he was told that Europeans would be the bulk of\nthe depositors but he came to learn that ``90 percent'' of the\ndepositors in Cayman banks were U.S. citizens.\n\n   When the European investors did not materialize, Mathewson got\ndirectly involved in the bank's operations in an effort to protect\nhis investment, he said Monday in court. He said this included\nusing a little ``Yankee ingenuity'' to promote the bank with\nadvertisements at the British West Indies island's main airport,\nand videotape presentations starring himself with his chiseled\nfeatures, shock of white hair and banker's self-assurance. He would\nexplain the benefits and confidentiality of the Cayman bank's\nservices at special sales sessions in local Grand Cayman hotels. He\ntouted the nearly 700 shelf companies that the bank had\npreregistered on the island as ready conduits for funds.\n\n   He said that the bank eventually acquired deposits totaling $350\nmillion. But in early 1995, he said, he was approached by a\nCaymanian government banking regulator who solicited a $250,000\nbribe. He refused and some months later his bank was the subject of\nan investigation into unspecified irregularities. It was eventually\ntaken over by the Cayman government and liquidated.\n\n   Mathewson, intending to seek new authority as a banker in the\nBahamas, left the Cayman's and temporarily moved to San Antonio.\nFederal agents arrested him in June 1996 as they were closing in on\nothers in the cable piracy scheme.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The tapes Mathewson offered to investigators were encrypted\nusing a specialized software and when U.S. authorities sought the\nhelp of the Royal Cayman Police, the island's government learned of\ntheir existence and demanded their return.\n\n   U.S. District Court Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr., assigned to\nhear the cable piracy case, eventually heard the Cayman's argument\nthat the tapes were the property of the Cayman Islands Monetary\nAuthority and should be returned and not used in any prosecutions.\nHe rejected all those arguments. In a 1997 opinion, he pointed out\nthat, by its own admission, the Cayman Islands was trying to avoid\nthe possible prosecution of the bank's customers and damage to\ntheir reputation for confidentiality that is ``vital to the banking\nindustry.''\n\n   ``The interest of the Cayman Islands in maintaining\nconfidentiality of records protected by the Cayman Confidential\nRelationship Law, while vital, does not overcome the interests of\nthe United States government in investigating violations of its\ncriminal laws,'' wrote the judge.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   With the help of Mathewson, who contacted European sources to\nget the software applications, the entire computer file was decoded\nin 18 months. Most of the tax-evasion and money-laundering cases\nresulting from the tapes are still being investigated.\n\n   But meanwhile, said Eric D. Bernstein, an assistant U.S.\nattorney with the Eastern District in New York, the information\nMathewson provided from his own files has assisted in numerous\nprosecutions.\n\n   ``No financial crime is without a trail even though the banks\nare in Caymans,'' said Carney, the assistant U.S. attorney. ``The\nbottom line is that if you look, you can find the money.\n\n   ``It is the government's expectation that when the entirety of\nthe defendant's cooperation is utilized, the benefits to both the\ncriminal and civil law enforcement authorities of the United States\nwill be immeasurable,'' the prosecutor said.\n\n   Mathewson, who faced a possible five-year prison term, was\nsentenced Monday to five years probation, 500 hours community\nservice and a $30,000 fine.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.

And, the judge noted as he peered down at\nMathewson from the bench, if it had not been for his cooperation,\n``I would have put you in prison for the maximum sentence.''\n\n   But the government of the Cayman Islands was not happy with\nMathewson's cooperation.
