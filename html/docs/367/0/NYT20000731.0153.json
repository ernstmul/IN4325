Now, with 9,000 titles and\ninexpensive players, DVD is on the cusp of replacing audio CD, VHS,\nCD-ROM, and video game discs and cartridges.\n\n   The digital versatile disc or digital video disc _ no one agrees\non what DVD stands for _ has revived the home video market,\nbreathed new life into old movies, given actors and directors the\noption to discuss their work on alternate tracks, and, with\ndeclining prices for both discs and players on the horizon, has\nbecome affordable for the consumer. Players can now be purchased\nfor $150 and the average price of a disc is expected to fall to\n$20-$25 retail before the end of the year. As of last month, more\nthan 2 million players have been sold, according to Jim Taylor,\nauthor of ``Demystifying DVD,'' the definitive book on the format.\n\n   ``Before its third birthday in March, 2000,'' writes Taylor,\n``DVD had become the most successful consumer electronics product\never.''\n\n   Paul Kagan, an industry analyst, expects 172 million discs to be\npurchased\n\n   this year and estimates that, by 2006, the total number will\nreach 623 million.\n\n   ``The sky's the limit,'' says Martin Greenwald, president of\nImage Entertainment, one of the largest distributors and licensees\nof DVD titles. ``I thought the laserdisc would catch on, but people\nweren't ready. Now they are. The only problem with the boom is\ngetting the discs out to the public and keeping the quality high.''\n\n   According to Paul Sweeting, who writes for both Video Business\nand Variety, rental spending is up 3.3 percent at a time when most\nexperts believed the rental market would continue shrinking. And\nit's due to the increased availability of DVD titles.   \n   \nStealing a look   \n  \n\n   But there's a problem. As long as there are products people are\nwilling to buy, there'll be others who are willing to steal them.\nPiracy is a huge issue for the producers. For several years, Steven\nSpielberg refused to release his films in DVD because of piracy\nproblems. Walt Disney Co. chairman and CEO Michael Eisner, who has\nreleased many of the Disney animated films on DVD, is threatening\nto delay ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' until he receives more\nassurances that safeguards will be improved.\n\n   The movie is ``one of the backbones of the company, and it could\nbe lost forever,'' Eisner told a joint committee of Congress\nearlier this summer. ``We're considering not doing it.''\n\n   Eisner, as quoted in Video Business magazine, called the threat\nof digital piracy ``the most devastating thing to happen to the\nentertainment business, I think, in 75 years.''\n\n   Shortly after Eisner's testimony, Congress passed the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act, a law designed to protect the studios\nagainst piracy. The Motion Picture Association of America and\nvarious other groups dedicated to preserving creative property have\nfiled suits against a variety of Web sites accusing them of\nillegally copying DVD movies.\n\n   US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan is currently hearing\ntestimony in New York in the case of Eric Corley, a computer hacker\nwho explained how to decode DVDs on his Internet site. The studios\nare suing Corley to prevent the ``unauthorized distribution of\ntheir copyrighted material.''\n\n   Marsha King, vice president of worldwide business affairs for\nWarner Home Video, testified, ``If the legislation is not upheld,\nthen we've lost our protection for products in the digital\ndomain.''\n\n   While Kaplan issued an injunction preventing Corley from\nunlocking the encryption codes, most industry analysts expect that\nno matter which side wins in New York, the other side will appeal\nand the legal ramifications won't be decided until the case, as\nexpected, gets to the US Supreme Court.\n\n   ``The big issue now is not whether DVD will succeed, but how we\nshould go about our business,'' said consultant Andrew Harrington.   \n   \nClarity begins at home   \n  \n\n   ``Part of the appeal of the DVD, aside from a clearer picture\nand crisper sound, is the additional information and entertainment\nvalue of the ancillary tracks,'' says R O'Donnell, a spokesman for\nCriterion and Home Vision, two major DVD manufacturers and\ndistributors. ``Our staff has also played an important role in film\npreservation.'' Since videotape tends to disintegrate through use\nover time, films last much longer when imprinted on DVD.\n\n   The additional appeal of DVD is that movie producers, directors,\nand actors are beginning to see the new format not as a competitor\nto the theatrical run, but as another step in a movie's\nevolutionary path.\n\n   ``I hope that more people get to see the film,'' says Sigourney\nWeaver, who took time out from a film she's shooting to discuss the\nfate of ``A Map of the World,'' an independent film that didn't\nfind a large audience during its theatrical run last fall and is\nslotted for release on DVD in mid-September.\n\n   ``The big films tend to crush the smaller ones in the\ntheaters,'' says the star of ``The Year of Living Dangerously,''\n``Ghostbusters,'' ``Alien,'' and dozens of other movies with\nbudgets large and small. ``This film came out of the festivals,\nincluding the Boston Film Festival, with great promise, but it's a\ncomplex film and needs good word-of-mouth. Unfortunately, it didn't\nlast long enough in the theaters to get that going. Everyone in the\nmovie business seems to be so impatient. I'm hoping that it'll find\nits audience on DVD.''\n\n   Frankie Muniz, 14, star of ``My Dog Skip,'' believes that the\nadditional commentary tracks on DVD add to the film's entertainment\nvalue. On the alternate track, the young actor talks about bonding\nwith Enzo, the Jack Russell terrier who plays the majority of\nSkip's scenes. Enzo, by the way, is the son of Moose, who plays\nEddie, the pooch on ``Frasier.'' Moose plays the older Skip at the\nend of the film.\n\n   ``I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to do the DVD,''\nsays Muniz, before reporting to work for his successful situation\ncomedy, ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' earlier this week. ``I was just\nhonest. I think the movie's just awesome and I'm not saying that\nbecause I'm in it. I would think it was the best movie even if I\nwasn't in it. I just sat down and talked about the movie. It was\ncool.''\n\n   At last week's Video Software Dealers Association conference in\nLas Vegas, industry professionals no longer debated the acceptance\nof the format but how to proceed in the future.\n\n   While the piracy issue remains unresolved, the DVD titles are\npouring out of the studios as fast as the manufacturers can press\nthe discs. Upcoming releases include ``Men in Black'' with\ncommentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld and star Tommy Lee Jones,\non Sept. 5, ``The Perfect Storm'' on Nov. 14, and ``Gladiator'' on\nNov. 21.\n","Headline":"\nTHE RISE _ AND FALLING PRICE _ OF THE DVD \n","Text":["\n   In March 1997, the DVD format debuted with about 900 titles and\nplayers costing as much as $1,000.
