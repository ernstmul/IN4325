DAVIS  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   ROCKLAND, Maine _ The day is sunny and the wind steady as the\ntwo-masted schooner American Eagle _ one of the fleet of\npassenger-carrying windjammers that ply the Maine coast each summer\n_ sails into the broad expanse of Penobscot Bay.\n\n   Having helped raise the schooner's sails, passengers line the\nrails to wave goodbye to land, other boats in Rockland Harbor,\nfishermen on the breakwater, and maybe to a few of their cares and\nworries as well. Windjammers have no fixed itinerary (that's part\nof their charm) and let prevailing winds set the course and dictate\nspeed.\n\n   Finding a place to anchor is rarely a problem. Penobscot Bay is\ndotted with islands offering sheltered coves and protected harbors,\none of the reasons it's such a popular yachting area.\n\n   John Foss, American Eagle's skipper and owner, brings the\nschooner around and heads up the coast, following the line of the\nCamden Hills that begin just north of Rockland. The ruggedly\nbeautiful Maine coastal scenery is another reason people love to\nsail up here.\n\n   As the hills slip away to the stern, Foss spins the wheel, puts\nAmerican Eagle on a northeasterly course and announces with casual\nauthority, ``I think we'll anchor off Islesboro tonight.'' The next\nnight it could be Deer Isle, Stonington, North Haven, or wherever.\n\n   A windjammer cruise is an old-fashioned, low-tech stress beater,\nwith a different small port to visit each day and constantly\nchanging seascapes to enjoy. What it isn't is a trip on a luxury\nliner.\n\n   Cabins are comfortable but usually cramped. Meals, which are\ncooked on woodstoves, are generous and savory (homemade bread and\nmuffins are the rule) but not gourmet. Entertainment is homegrown.\nFoss reads poems and short stories to his passengers after dinner,\nfor instance, while other captains play the guitar or organize sea\nchantey singalongs.\n\n   All of the dozen or so windjammers in the fleet have a lobster\nbake during each cruise, usually on an uninhabited island. You'll\nnever know just how good a Maine lobster can taste until you've\neaten one cooked in a bucket of seawater on the beach of a\nlupine-speckled island in Penobscot Bay.\n\n   Windjammers themselves are as indigenous to the Maine coast as\nlobsters and a century ago seemed nearly as common. Today, the\nfleet is unique. Nowhere else in the world will you find such a\nconcentration of passenger-carrying sailing ships as along\nmid-coast Maine.\n\n   Most of the windjammers are veterans of the age of sail and\nbegan as coastal cargo carriers. The oldest, the Lewis R. French,\nwas launched in Christmas Cove, Maine, in 1871 and has been\ncarrying timber and passengers along the Maine coast ever since.\nThe Stephen Taber was built as a coastal schooner on Long Island in\nthe same year. Both are listed on the National Historic Register.\n\n   The 132-foot-long Victory Chimes, built in 1900 to carry lumber\naround Chesapeake Bay, accommodates 40 passengers and is the\nlargest passenger sailing vessel under the American flag. It is\nalso the last three-masted schooner on the East Coast.\n\n   It's often difficult, at least for a landlubber, to tell a\nmodern windjammer _ one built to carry passengers, not freight _\nfrom a historic one. For instance, the 30-passenger Heritage,\nlaunched in 1983 at North End shipyard in Rockland, has\ncontemporary comforts but the sturdy lines of a traditional\n19th-century Maine coaster.\n\n   Although banded together in the Maine Windjammer Association,\nschooners are individually owned by their captains (frequently a\nhusband and wife team) and have distinctive characters. Each almost\nalways boasts an eventful history.\n\n   Ask him about American Eagle's background and Foss smiles.\n``She's 70 years old,'' he says, ``and is one of the last\nGloucester fishing schooners.'' Launched in Gloucester, Mass., in\n1930, the American Eagle was a commercial fishing vessel on Georges\nBanks off the New England coast for more than 50 years.\n\n   Foss bought the 24-passenger schooner in 1983 and completely\nrebuilt and restored it at the North End yard. Although most of its\nsailing is around Penobscot Bay, American Eagle is an ocean-going\nvessel, not a coaster, and has cruised as far as New Brunswick and\nNova Scotia.\n\n   The windjammers are based in Rockland, Camden, and Rockport, but\nall of them, along with visiting tall ships, will pass in review\nduring Rockland's Schooner Days and North Atlantic Blues Festival,\nJuly 7-9. Any windjammer under sail is a beautiful sight, but\nwatching a parade of them with all flags flying is an experience.\n\n     \nThe Maine Windjammer Association's website is\nwww.sailmainecoast.com.\n","Headline":"\nSCHOONER VACATIONERS GO WHERE THE WIND TAKES THEM \n","Text":["\n   ROCKLAND, Maine _ The day is sunny and the wind steady as the\ntwo-masted schooner American Eagle _ one of the fleet of\npassenger-carrying windjammers that ply the Maine coast each summer\n_ sails into the broad expanse of Penobscot Bay.\n","\n   Having helped raise the schooner's sails, passengers line the\nrails to wave goodbye to land, other boats in Rockland Harbor,\nfishermen on the breakwater, and maybe to a few of their cares and\nworries as well.
