Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the deficit-plagued 1980s, the Treasury\nDepartment struggled to find novel ways of financing the\ngovernment's ballooning daily expenses even as tax receipts fell\nfurther and further behind.\n\n   Now the Treasury still has a cash-flow crisis, but of a\ndifferent kind: It must figure out what to do with the windfall\ncash generated as tax receipts continue to soar above expenses _ at\nleast until Congress and the White House agree how to spend or\nrefund the riches.\n\n   The answer, outlined on Thursday by Treasury Secretary Lawrence\nH. Summers, is to make the Treasury Department for the first time a\nbuyer as well as a seller of bonds. The Treasury, following some\nstandard Wall Street tactics, will start intervening in the open\nmarket to manage its $3.6 trillion debt. Not unlike a company's use\nof spare cash to buy back its own stock in hopes of propping up the\nshare price, the government hopes to lower its overall debt\ninterest payments as a result.\n\n   The department plans to use up to $30 billion of surplus cash\nthis year to buy back outstanding debt, Summers said. It will try\nto entice investors to sell old bonds on which the government pays\ninterest rates that are much higher than the prevailing rates\ntoday. Using spare cash to play the bond market in this way is\nunprecedented, senior Treasury officials said, though the\ngovernment jumped into the market to swap new debt for old debt in\nthe 1960s.\n\n   ``Buying back old, higher-interest debt allows us to manage the\nfederal debt in a way that saves the American taxpayer money,''\nSummers said in rolling out the debt buyback program, which was\nfirst broached last summer. ``This is a new and welcome debt\nmanagement challenge for the government.''\n\n   The program will not be the main way the government reduces its\noverall debt. That is done more or less automatically by paying off\ninvestors whose bonds come due without issuing lots of new bonds.\nIn the last two years _ when the government started generating\nsurpluses for the first time since the 1960s _ it has reduced debt\nby $140 billion in that way.\n\n   The new intervention is aimed at accelerating the reduction of\ndebt and at increasing the trading of the bonds that remain in the\nmarket. By limiting and simplifying the menu of bonds, the\ngovernment can increase buying or selling of what is on offer. That\nreduces the risk investors take in buying the bonds, and means they\nwill often accept slightly lower interest payments.\n\n   The benefits of such financial wizardry tend to be measured in\nbasis points, or hundredths of percentage points. But when the\ngovernment has $3.6 trillion in publicly traded debt outstanding,\neven a hundredth of a percentage point in savings equals $360\nmillion in taxpayer money that can be used for some other purpose.\n\n   Treasury officials did not predict how much could be saved\nthrough the buyback program, in part because it depends on how the\nmarket reacts. The Treasury would like to buy back bonds paying\nnearly 14 percent interest, as some old government issues do, and\nforce investors to buy newer issues that pay just over 6 percent.\nBut investors might well choose to hold to the higher-paying bonds,\neven if the Treasury offers a nice premium in the open market to\nbuy them back.\n\n   The Treasury looks set to have plenty of extra cash to try its\nhand at market intervention. After the budget surplus reached $69\nbillion in 1998 and $123 billion last year, the Congressional\nBudget Office is predicting a surplus of $161 billion in fiscal\n2000.    \n   \n  \n","Headline":"\nTREASURY PLANS TO BUY SOME BONDS BACK \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ Throughout the deficit-plagued 1980s, the Treasury\nDepartment struggled to find novel ways of financing the\ngovernment's ballooning daily expenses even as tax receipts fell\nfurther and further behind.\n","\n   Now the Treasury still has a cash-flow crisis, but of a\ndifferent kind: It must figure out what to do with the windfall\ncash generated as tax receipts continue to soar above expenses _ at\nleast until Congress and the White House agree how to spend or\nrefund the riches.\n","\n   The answer, outlined on Thursday by Treasury Secretary Lawrence\nH.
