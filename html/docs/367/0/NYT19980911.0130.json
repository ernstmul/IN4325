The Boston Sunday Globe once ran a giant\nlobster on the front page making fun of former      Governor Edward\nKing's taste for lobster salad sandwiches. If a business guy runs\nfor office, you can bet he wants government to operate more like a\nbusiness.\n\n   Getting the inside scoop on the business of business, though,\nisn't easy. Stories about feeding at the government trough are\ncommon because of all the required disclosures. In constrast, the\nfilings even for exchange-listed companies rarely go beyond what a\nfew top executives make. It is, after all, the private sector.\n\n   But New York state offers a rare window on who makes what in the\ninsurance industry. The state's insurance department requires\ncompanies doing business there to list all employees and outside\nvendors that make $60,000 or more a year. That includes\nMassachusetts insurers like John Hancock and Massachusetts Mutual.\nIt's the best $11 of our publisher's money we have spent in a long\ntime.\n\n   Question to John Hancockers: Do you know what the guy in the\noffice next to yours makes? We do.\n\n        Let's start with the Million Dollar Club. Eight Hancock\nexecutives made $1 million or more in salary and bonus last year,\naccording to the New York filing. Chairman Stephen L. Brown was No.\n1, of course, at $2.9 million,      followed by retired president\nWilliam Boyan Jr.      at $1.8 million and vice chairman Foster Aborn\nat $1.6 million. David D'Alessandro, who gets more press than all\nthe other suits combined, was paid $1.3 millionas senior executive\nvice president, but probably got a boost when he became president\nin January.\n\n   Altogether 27      people made $500,000 or more at John Hancock and\nanother 110 people made $200,000 to $500,000. But Hancock's filing,\nwhich includes 19 pages of who got what, understates what Hancock\npays its top people      because the report does not include the\ncompany's money management and other subsidaries. We're willing to\nbet that a number of those at John Hancock Mutual Funds and\nIndependent Investment Associates make $1 million or more a year,\nand some could well top Brown's compensation package.\n\n   The same goes for Massachusetts Mutual. The Springfield, Mass.\ninsurer had six      current or former executives in the Million Dollar\nClub. Chairman Thomas Wheeler topped the list at $3.5 million.      In\nall 15 made $500,000 or more and another 60 made $200,000 to\n$500,000. But those numbers do not include its successful money\nmanagement units like OppenheimerFunds and David L. Babson.\n\n   Both John Hancock and MassMutual say their pay packages reflect\nwhat it costs to attract and retain good people. They also say\ncompensation for top executives is heavily skewed toward\nperformance incentives and reflects the good years the companies\nhave been enjoying recently.\n\n   Hancock had its best year ever in 1997. It reported a net gain,\nor profit, of $506 million, up 41      percent from a year earlier, and\nsaw assets under management grow 11 percent. MassMutual's profits\nwere up 32 percent to $304 million, and assets under management\ngrew 9 percent.\n\n   But there wasn't a lot of talk of record profits or big bonuses\nearlier this year when both companies were pressing Beacon Hill for\ntwo pieces of legislation, one that would provide the industry a\n$50 million tax cut and another that would allow the insurers to\nsell stock to the public without giving up management control.\n\n   Instead, both companies emphasized how the current tax system\nwas unfair to Massachusetts-based insurers and how important it was\nfor the companies to be able to dip into the public markets for new\ncapital to remain competitive. The Legislature approved both bills.\n\n   Hancock says drawing comparisons between its profitability and\nthe tax cut is unfair and misses the point of why the Legislature\nacted. ``The comparisons you're now trying to draw _ that one issue\nsomehow sheds light on the other _ misrepresents the facts and\nborders on the disingenuous,'' Hancock spokesman Stephen Burgay\nsaid Thursday. The tax cut, fully phased in, will save Hancock $12\nmillion to $14 million a year, he said; MassMutual will save about\n$7.7 million.\n\n   Both companies say the pay packages reflect the fact that as\nmutual insurers, owned by their policyholders, they cannot offer\nexecutives the same kind of stock options that publicly held\ncompanies can. Look for that to change: Hancock has already said it\nplans to demutualize and sell stock to the public, and MassMutual\nis also exploring ways to go public.\n\n   Do you think that in a world where they keep score by who has\nthe biggest paycheck that it escaped anyone's attention who was the\nstate's highest paid insurance executive last year? He was John F.\nO'Brien, chief executive of the much smaller but publicly held\nAllmerica Financial Corp., who made $3.6 million.\n\n   The Hancock and MassMutual filings make great reading. Some\nhighlights:\n\n   _Hancock's list is full of familiar names.\n\n   Hill Holliday boss Jack Connors is Hancock's lowest-paid\ndirector at $43,000. On the other hand, $25.5 million in Hancock\nmoney flowed through Connors' advertising agency. Most of that\nrepresented purchases of corporate advertising and fees for\nHancock's sponsorship of the Olympics, but about $3 million      went\nas revenue to Hill Holliday, executives of both companies say.\nConnors said his firm's total revenue will be around $96\nmillion      this year.\n\n   Other familiar names that show up: John Sasso's political\nconsulting firm was paid $222,922; Larry Moulter's      Woolf\nAssociates made $229,167; and former Dukakis adviser Nick\nMitropoulos       got $104,200.\n\n   _Hancock's petty cash drawer is always full.\n\n   Rentokil Tropical Plant Services was paid $273,047.      The Boston\nRed Sox message board cost Hancock $173,334, and a gift shop\nconsultant $62,524.

The median salary for directors at MassMutual is $94,000\nvs. $52,000 for Hancock.\n\n   Some women are making a lot of dough at both companies, but not\nas much as men.
