When that day comes, ``you have ended, in\neffect, the American intellectual strength that we have had,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   Eisner made a pitch for stronger legal protection of\nintellectual property on the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit''\norganized by the congressional Joint Economic Committee.\nIntellectual property includes the movies, music, books, software\nand other copyrighted materials that can be passed around the\nInternet.\n\n   ``With the click of a mouse, pirated copies of intellectual\nproperty can be transmitted around the world,'' Eisner said. ``The\nartists who compose and perform music have already been\nvictimized.''\n\n   As Internet technology improves, ``it will be possible to\ntransmit perfect copies (of movies) without our knowledge,\nparticipation or consent,'' he said.\n\n   This growing piracy could lead to the financial collapse of the\nentertainment industry, which would have a broad economic impact,\nEisner said. ``American copyright industries lead all major\nindustry sectors in foreign sales and exports,'' he said.\n\n   Eisner urged Congress to ``explore with us'' the possibility of\nrequiring computer manufacturers and Internet service providers to\ninstall technologies that could look for digital ``watermarks'' on\ncopyrighted materials. If a consumer tried to download a bootlegged\nmovie without such a mark, the operation would fail.\n\n   Eisner also asked Congress to ``work with governments around the\nworld to respect our rights.'' He said he wants the federal\ngovernment to help educate consumers about piracy, saying many\npeople don't realize the harm they are doing when they download\nstolen materials.\n\n   Eisner wasn't alone in his pleadings Wednesday, At a news\nconference, the Business Software Alliance called upon the\npresumptive presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and\nGov. George W. Bush of Texas, to take strong anti-piracy positions.\n\n   The coalition of top software executives predicted that in the\nnext five years, two-thirds of all software will be distributed\nover the Internet, and this ``makes it more important than ever to\nensure strong copyright protection for computer software.'' The\nexecutives pointed to a new study by the International Planning and\nResearch Corp., which estimated that global software piracy rate\nwas 36 percent in 1999. But in some countries, the piracy rate was\nmore than 90 percent.\n\n   Industry executives at the new conference conceded that software\nmakers could revise their products to better protect them from\npiracy.\n\n   ``From a technical standpoint, it's quite true that we could do\nthat,'' said Carol Bartz, chairman and chief executive of Autodesk\nInc. ``But I'm not at all sure you would like the results. Those\nchanges could create a tremendous inconvenience for consumers.''\n\n   Andrew J.
