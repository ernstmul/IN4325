Chairman Michael Eisner urged Congress\non Wednesday to protect copyrighted intellectual properties by\nenacting tough new curbs against piracy on the Internet, including\nmandating that computer manufacturers produce hardware with\nbuilt-in safeguards against hacking.\n\n   Using clips from the new Disney animated feature ``Dinosaur'' as\na prop, Eisner told an all-star lineup of Senate and House members\nat the Capitol luncheon that ``there is no way around it, theft is\ntheft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard.''\n\n   ``We have created a movie (`Dinosaur') that took four years to\nmake, during which 45 million megabytes were crunched - enough to\nfill 70,000 CD-ROMs - all to generate data for an 80-minute film,''\nEisner said. ``Were it to fall in the wrong hands, it could be\ncompressed onto a single DVD disc in a matter of minutes and put on\nthe Internet while the movie is still in theaters.''\n\n   His announcement came amid growing worries in the entertainment\nindustry over the impact of new broadband Internet technology.\nBroadband, now in an estimated 5 million homes nationwide, allows\nfor much faster transmission and downloading of computer data,\nincluding digitized movies and music.\n\n   Using older Internet technology, it can take up to 24 hours to\ndownload a feature-length film. With broadband, the process can\ntake 15 minutes.\n\n   Eisner specifically asked Congress to mandate that all computer\nand software manufacturers build anti-hacking systems into their\nproducts. He also called for an expanded international crackdown on\npiracy.\n\n   The Disney chief also announced that the entertainment industry\nplans to take a leading role in efforts to develop encryption and\nother security systems ``to stay one step ahead of the hackers.''\n\n   Eisner also called for a campaign to educate the public on the\nevils of copyright infringement. He also advocated a fair pricing\npolicy for movies and music that would make pirated copies less\nattractive to consumers.\n\n   While Eisner expressed confidence that the computer industry\nwould cooperate with the anti-piracy effort, he noted that some\nleaders of the high-tech sector are reluctant to put any access\nrestrictions on the Internet.\n\n   ``I find it disingenuous of computer companies to fight\ncopyright protections,'' said Eisner.\n\n   He warned that failure to curb piracy could lead to the demise\nof the Internet. Eisner said that if intellectual properties and\nincome from such efforts are ``allowed to be pirated away, then the\ncreative risk takers will put their energies elsewhere and the\nInternet will become a wonderful delivery system with nothing\nwonderful to deliver.''\n\n   Eisner told the lawmakers that legislation was the only real\nremedy, adding: ``Would the car companies have put in seat belts\nwithout a law?''\n\n   California Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, the House's\nleading expert on copyright protection, expressed support for\nEisner's proposal. He led the fight in 1998 for passage of the\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the manufacture and\nimport of technology that is specifically designed to facilitate\npiracy.\n\n   Berman is currently pushing a bill that would step up\nenforcement of copyright laws by the Justice Department.\n\n   ``We need to put more resources and a higher priority on this\neffort,'' Berman said. ``I believe a few high-profile prosecutions\ncan have a tremendous effect on piracy.''\n\n   The film industry's effort to shut out pirates will be led by\nthe Motion Picture Association of America. Jack Valenti, MPAA\nchairman and Hollywood's star Washington lobbyist, said Wednesday\nthat he is putting together a team of experts ``to put a\ntechnological armor plate around our properties on the Internet.''\n\n   Valenti and Eisner said piracy of films is still in its infancy,\ngiven the limited access to broadband technology. And many films\nposted on the Internet are of poor quality, including some\nvideotaped off theater screens.\n\n   But both men warned that Hollywood could be in for a pirate\nsiege within 18 months, when both broadband and digital video disc\ntechnology are expected to be in wide use.\n\n   Among the existing gateways to film piracy on the Internet is\nScour.com, which allows users to seek out, exchange and copy\nmovies. On Wednesday, the Web site advertised links to\ndownload-ready copies of ``Gladiator'' and ``Mission: Impossible\n2,'' which are still in theaters.\n\n   Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent and Disney president\nwho received a $130 million golden parachute when he left the\nBurbank-based entertainment giant in 1996, is one of two majority\nowners of Scour.com.\n\n   Asked to comment on Ovitz's Internet venture, Eisner said:\n``He's just one of 30 companies out there involved in this. But I\nbelieve he has more sensitivity to the needs of the artists.''\n\n   Eisner said piracy threatens the nation's overall economic\nhealth, noting that from 1977 to 1997, the combined income of the\nfilm, TV, home video, music, publishing and computer software\nindustries rose from $160 billion per year to $530 billion. He also\nstressed that the value of exports of U.S. intellectual properties\nincreased from $36 billion to $66 billion per year from 1991 to\n1997.\n\n   Eisner, ever the showman, sprinkled his presentation with\nplayful plugs for Disney. In addition to the ``Dinosaur'' clips,\nhis audience - which included Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and\nCalifornia Reps. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, and Henry Waxman,\nD-Los Angeles - was given multimedia reminders of the extent of\nDisney's realm.
