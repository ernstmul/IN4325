The act of incest in ``Cement Garden.'' The father\nlosing his daughter in the supermarket and, later, the slow-motion\ncar crash in ``The Child in Time.'' There's the chopping up of a\nbody in ``The Innocent.'' The haunted house scene in ``Black\nDogs.'' Most breathtaking, there's the wayward balloon at the start\nof ``Enduring Love.'' Finally, there's the hillside rapist and a\nwitness's chilling passivity that marks the turning point of his\nmost recent work, the winner of last year's Booker Prize,\n``Amsterdam'' (published by Doubleday).\n\n   These are terrifying scenes _ McEwan moments, they might be\ncalled _ in which characters move through a dreamlike haze with a\nknife-sharp awareness of detail, time seems palpable and prolonged,\nevents spin out of control, characters are stripped to their core,\nand lives are irreversibly transformed.\n\n   Yet the author of these tales, by all appearances, is a classic\nmild-mannered fellow: 50, soft-spoken, slight of build, with\nglasses, thinning hairline, dry humor. His longtime friend and\nfellow British writer Christopher Hitchens confirms the impression:\n``Ian is the most pleasant guy you'd ever want to know.''\n\n   So what about those scenes that mark all of his novels, those\nmoments of gripping horror? Do they reflect nothing at all in\nMcEwan's own life?\n\n   McEwan, who is passing through New York to promote his new novel\n_ which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for six\nweeks _ considers the question for no more than a second.\n\n   ``The fact that some of these things are horrible,'' he says,\n``is unimportant. I do love to generate a kind of narrative\nintensity. I do like to take my readers to the edge. I like to\ngenerate that sense of danger. I'm interested in finding out how\ncharacters survive, or are shaped by, their destinies.\n\n   ``But _ and it seems odd to say this,'' he goes on, ``but the\nprimary driving force behind these scenes is aesthetic. It's like a\npainter using a certain color. I like novels in which something\nhappens. It's not the only thing one wants in a novel, but I hold\nto quite old-fashioned beliefs in the power of the story, our need\nfor story. Even if we're no longer children, our habits of\nnarrative are very strong. So,'' he restates the point, ``it's\nprimarily aesthetic.''\n\n   He expresses a slight annoyance at the numerous reviews that\ndescribe his work as macabre. ``I see that word `macabre,' '' he\nsays, ``and I sense somewhere inside me a great yawn. It's idle.\nIt's lazy. The last really macabre scene was the cutting up of the\nbody in `The Innocent.' I wrote that in 1988.'' He pauses. ``I've\nwritten plenty of other moods and scenes since.''\n\n   McEwan's ``Amsterdam'' _ about two old friends, a composer who\nthinks he's a genius and a journalist who knows he's a louse, the\nscandals they sire, and the revenge that ensues _ certainly ranks\namong his least macabre, though he takes some nasty jabs at his\ncharacters toward the end.\n\n   ``I had such fun writing it,'' McEwan exclaims, smiling. ``I\nwrote it in a state of glee. It grew out of my love for certain\nkinds of novels in the English comic tradition, the key figure\nbeing Evelyn Waugh. I see it as a version of the comic novel that\ndoes not attempt to be funny at every turn, which I find quite\noppressive, like someone blowing the trumpet in your ear.''\n\n   McEwan has always been the least horn-blowing among the British\nwriters of his generation, a peculiarly cliquish bunch that\nincludes _ most well known on this side of the Atlantic _ novelists\nMartin Amis and Julian Barnes and journalist Hitchens, all of whom\nstudied together at Oxford in the late 1960s and early '70s.\n\n   ``I must be the only writer in Britain who did not go to Oxford\nor Cambridge,'' McEwan cracks. ``Novel writing is such a democratic\nactivity, you don't need a lot of money to get started. So it does\nseem extraordinary to me _ I mean, to write novels, you need to be\nliterate and imaginative, but I can't believe that Oxford and\nCambridge have a monopoly on them.''\n\n   McEwan went to the University of Sussex, and cannot think of\nanother writer who did the same. His mother was a chambermaid. His\nfather joined the army to escape unemployment and ``rose through\nthe ranks slowly.'' Ian was, practically speaking, an only child.\n(He has a half brother and half sister, but they are much older; he\ndidn't grow up with either.) At age 11, he was sent to a state-run\nboarding school, not one of the private institutions that most\nBritish writers attended. The masters who ran it, he recalls, ``had\nthe old-fashioned left view of taking working-class kids and\nturning them into middle-class kids.'' Nearly all his classmates _\npoor bright boys from central London _ went on to university.\n\n   Sussex was a fairly new campus and, as McEwan puts it, ``had a\nwish to redraw the map of learning.'' An English lit major at\nOxford focused on precisely that _ reading English literature, from\n``Beowulf'' on up _ while his counterpart at Sussex delved into the\nrest of European literature as well.\n\n   As a result, at age 21, McEwan read Kafka, and that's when he\nknew he wanted to be a writer. ``It seems odd to say this,'' McEwan\nmuses, ``but Kafka was like freedom to me. It wasn't bogged down in\na documented social world. Knowing nothing about the social world''\n_ by which he means the world of high society _ ``I found it\nliberating that I could be a writer and not know whether that's a\nLouis Quatorze chair you're sitting on.
