Times News Service   \n\n   The title of this very personal story of spiritual quest by\nDavid Klinghoffer comes, we learn by reading his epigraph, from\nPsalm 27: ``Should my father and mother abandon me, the Lord will\ngather me in.'' Well, Klinghoffer's parents, who brought him up in\nan affluent Reform Jewish household in Southern California,\ncertainly did not abandon him. But Klinghoffer, 33 and a senior\neditor at the National Review magazine, was adopted at birth, so in\na way he was abandoned by his biological father and mother. And\nwhen he says that the Lord gathered him in, he means that he sees\nin the pattern of his life a plan for him to find meaning and\nfulfillment in the strict and demanding practice of Orthodox\nJudaism.\n\n   One can be skeptical that Klinghoffer's personal religious\njourney was part of a divine plan and still find ``The Lord Will\nGather Me In'' rewarding. It recounts a transformation from a\nwisecracking California boy born to an unknown Swedish immigrant\ninto an Orthodox New York Jew who wears fringes on his\nundergarments (symbolic of the 613 biblical commandments) and a\nskullcap, and whose most intense joy is to study Torah, the\ndocuments and laws that form the basis of Jewish practice and\nbelief.\n\n   Klinghoffer's account of this rebirth as a Jew is barbed at\ntimes, poignant at others; it is modest in its religious learning,\nbut thoughtful and informed in those few places where Klinghoffer\ndoes tackle theological questions. His brief disquisition on\n``family purity,'' the Orthodox practice whereby spouses maintain\nconjugal separation during the wife's menstruation, is a model of\nclarity. Here and there Klinghoffer's text takes on an annoyed,\nuncharitable, unkindly tone, especially when he speaks of the\nvarieties of the Jewish experience that he does not find authentic.\nBut he writes with integrity and insight, making clear and tough\ndemands on himself, and his story of struggle with God and identity\nis moving.\n\n   Klinghoffer did not come to his Jewish identity easily. He knew\nthat his birth mother was not Jewish and that technically that made\nhim a Gentile. (In his final chapters, he describes how he\ndiscovered the identities of his birth parents and established a\nwarm relationship with his biological mother.)\n\n   His life for years was a briar patch of contradictions. For\nreasons too complicated to explain here but that are fully detailed\nby Klinghoffer, he went through three separate conversion\nceremonies, including three symbolic circumcisions. Even as he\nbecame absorbed by his Jewishness, he formed a serious attachment\nto a young Roman Catholic woman who pleaded with him to accept\nJesus, leading an anguished and confused Klinghoffer to open\nhimself up to some sign of guidance from the Saviour. When no such\nsign came, he took his first major step toward strict Jewish\nobservance.\n\n   ``I would guess,'' he writes, ``that not many Jews have tried to\nstrike up a conversation with Jesus one night and a few nights\nlater commenced observing the Jewish Sabbath for the first time in\ntheir lives.''\n\n   Early on Klinghoffer writes rather bitterly of the spiritual\nthinness of the Reform Judaism in which he was reared, contrasting,\nfor example, the simple dignity of an Orthodox bar mitzvah with the\ngarish and vulgar displays he knew among the Reform Jews of\nSouthern California. He speaks disparagingly of the decision, made\nby Conservative Jewry in 1950, to allow Jews to drive to the\nsynagogue on the Sabbath, something prohibited by the Orthodox.\nConservative observance, as a result, ``died by a hundred small\ncuts,'' Klinghoffer writes in disapproval of what he sees as this\nassimilationist backsliding.\n\n   No doubt many Conservative Jews (including this critic) will\nwant to argue with much of this. Klinghoffer's complaint about\nvulgarity really has to do with the shallow materialism of the\nnouveau riche, not with a variety of Jewish practice. Vulgar\ndisplays of conspicuous consumption have occurred among the\nOrthodox as well as the Reform. And driving on the Sabbath might\nhave done more to save Jewish observance than inflict a death of a\nhundred cuts. Suburban Jews are more likely to give up observance\naltogether than to move back to the city so they can be within\nwalking distance of a synagogue.\n\n   Plainly, there are a lot of Jews who do not inspire\nKlinghoffer's admiration, and, in some instances, his criticism is\nwell directed. (He writes, for example, of Orthodox groups whose\nlack of appreciation for ``the privilege of living in America'' is\nshown by their habit of holding their national conventions on\nThanksgiving.) But Klinghoffer is eloquent and stubborn as he makes\nhis case for orthodoxy as the only authentic Jewish practice and\nidentity. For him, true Judaism must be rooted in knowing Torah,\nobserving the commandments and believing above all that they come\nfrom God.\n\n   The truth is that for many Jews living in America more freely\nand more openly than Jews have ever lived in the Diaspora before,\nJudaism has become an amalgam of things not necessarily dependent\non a belief in God. Judaism is a historical attachment; it is a set\nof values, a music and a poetry, a collection of fables and\ncommentaries that make up a magnificently rich literature on\nvirtually every human situation.\n\n   Not least, Jewish attachment is an unwillingness to forsake an\nidentity for which ancestors were persecuted and murdered.
