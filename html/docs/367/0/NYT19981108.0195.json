Frank\nhad run into software pirates.\n\n   ``This is perceived by criminal enterprises as a much safer\ncrime to commit,'' Frank said. ``There's an incredible amount of\nmoney these people are making doing this kind of stuff, and the\nfeeling is, a lot of it is not getting investigated.''\n\n   Indeed, an estimated four of every 10 business-software\napplications in use worldwide last year were pirated, costing the\nsoftware industry $11.4 billion a year in lost revenue.\n\n   The Westminster case, made public this summer after federal\nindictments were filed, illustrates how police and private\ninvestigators hired by software companies themselves have stepped\nup their campaign to crack down on software pirates.\n\n   Companies like Microsoft Corp. and Autodesk Inc., frequent\ntargets of software counterfeiters, have even assembled their own\nenforcement teams, including former police officers, to go after\npirates. Microsoft alone has a team of 100 chasing software pirates\naround the world.\n\n   ``Software piracy is not a violent crime. There is no blood\nsplattered; there are no bodies; it's not sexy,'' said a\nsoftware-piracy investigator for San Rafael's Autodesk Inc.\n\n   ``It's a financial crime, and people aren't interested in\nhearing about it. But it impacts the industry, and it impacts how\nmuch software costs to everybody,'' said the investigator, who\ndidn't want to be identified for safety reasons.\n\n   Another software investigator, who only would speak anonymously,\nsaid pirates typically manufacture counterfeit software in Southern\nCalifornia and make Northern California a major distribution point.\n\n   Pirated software ends up at flea markets, loaded in new or used\ncomputers, and at smaller software stores. It also can be\ndistributed through mail-order catalogs and advertised on the\nInternet.\n\n   The Business Software Alliance, an industry watchdog group whose\nmembers include Microsoft, Autodesk, Adobe Systems Inc. and Lotus\nDevelopment Inc., hopes to spotlight the problem through political\nlobbying, advertising and churning out statistics that bring the\nproblem home to consumers.\n\n        One BSA study concluded pointed out    that California lost\n18,900 jobs and $2.5 billion in wages and tax revenues due to\npiracy in 1997.\n\n         The BSA and a sister organization, the Software Publishers\nAssociation, both based in Washington D.C., estimate that 27\npercent of the software in use in the United States _ and 90\npercent in parts of Asia and Eastern Europe _ was obtained\nillegally.\n\n   ``Despite all of our efforts to educate and enforce, there's\nstill a big problem out there. It's not just a problem with pirates\ngoing around selling software at flea markets or making it\navailable on the Internet. It's a mainstream problem,'' said Bob\nKruger, the BSA's vice president for enforcement.\n\n   The biggest pirates are not gangsters or flea-market hustlers   ,\n   but businesses.\n\n   The BSA and individual software-makers are receiving an\nincreasing number of tips on their anti-piracy hotlines, typically\nfrom disgruntled employees looking for a way to get back at their\nemployers.\n\n   Some corporate pirates mistakenly install programs on more\ncomputers than they've bought licenses for, while others\nintentionally make and use illegal copies.\n\n   Sandra Boulton, director of Autodesk's Piracy Prevention\nDepartment, said that for every copy of her company's AutoCAD\nprofessional design program sold, investigators are finding seven\nillegal copies in use. One reason is the high price of AutoCAD,\nwhich costs $3,750 per user.\n\n   ``We get a court order, we get a federal marshal, we go in, pull\neveryone away from their computers and go through each machine in\nthe business checking hard drives against records for what's\nsupposed to be there,'' Boulton said. ``In many cases, we're\nfinding 20 or more'' illegal copies at a single company.\n\n   On Thursday, Autodesk announced a settlement with General\nPrecision Inc., a Valencia environmental-control-systems\nmanufacturer. Autodesk sued GPI after it discovered 20 illegal\ncopies of AutoCAD during a raid at the company. GPI agreed to pay\nAutodesk $120,000 in fines plus the cost of new software.\n\n         In five years, the BSA has collected more than $30 million in\nfines from the likes of Budget Rent-a-Car and the Los Angeles\nUnified School District.\n\n   ``They pay their taxes, they obey occupational health and safety\nacts, but they have a blind spot when it comes to software\ncopyright compliance,'' Kruger said.\n\n   Microsoft in particular has become more aggressive in going\nafter corporate pirates.\n\n   Last Monday, the Redmond, Wash., software company announced\nlawsuits against seven Texas firms, alleging infringement of\nMicrosoft copyrights after investigations by the company and law\nenforcement agencies turned up counterfeit copies of Windows 95 and\nOffice Professional 97 at swap meets in the Dallas and Houston\nareas.\n\n   And in the past two months, Microsoft has sued a dozen computer\nfirms and stores in Southern California, North Carolina and Arizona\nfor distributing illegal software.\n\n   In most of those cases, Microsoft alleged that resellers loaded\nillegal copies of software into computers they sold, a process\nknown as hard-drive loading.\n\n   Some targets say Microsoft is overzealous. Ron Carroll and\nKatherine Everett, who own a used-computer franchise in Charlotte,\nN.C., were sued by Microsoft for allegedly loading a laptop with a\ncounterfeit Office 97 program for a Microsoft investigator posing\nas a customer.\n\n   Ron Summa, a Charlotte attorney representing the married couple,\nsaid his clients didn't know the software was counterfeit.\n\n   Summa complained that he was working on a settlement with\nMicrosoft but believes Microsoft publicized its suit last month to\ncoincide with anti-piracy ads the BSA was running in local\nnewspapers.\n\n   But Kruger said the BSA and software companies are only trying\nto protect what rightfully belongs to them.\n\n   ``We're not out there to be cowboys,'' Kruger said. ``A lot of\npeople associate what we're doing with picking on people. We are\nvictims of a rather serious problem that threatens to undermine an\nimportant industry.''\n\n        Microsoft also helped Westminster police Detective Frank crack\nthe counterfeit ring.\n\n   Frank didn't think that he would run into the underworld when he\nreceived the original citizen's tip in May 1997, forwarded from\nMicrosoft's anti-piracy hotline, that someone was trying to print\ncopies of a Windows 95 manual at a Westminster print shop.\n\n   Frank went in with a search warrant and uncovered evidence that\ntwo other shops were printing manuals. The investigators for\nFrank's small, 105-officer Westminster police department kept\nfollowing the leads and were able to penetrate the lower five\nlevels of an eight-level organization designed to keep other levels\nsecret even if one level was exposed.\n\n   The counterfeiting would take place in different locations:\nMicrosoft software was duplicated on CD-ROM replicating machines in\none spot, and some 16,000 operating manuals were copied at print\nshops in Westminster and Garden Grove. Fake registration cards and\ncertificates of authenticity were produced in another location.\n\n   The packages then were assembled, shrink-wrapped and sold in\nsmall retail outlets, but they also were shipped to countries like\nAustralia, Canada, England and the Netherlands.\n\n   Potential buyers sometimes would have to bring an empty truck to\na parking lot and turn the keys over to the software pirates, who\nwould drive the truck to another location, pick up the goods and\nreturn them to the buyer.\n\n   Police also recovered lists with ``hundreds'' of customers,\nFrank said.\n\n   Similar to a narcotics operation, ``there were a lot of\nhand-to-hand buys, lots of cash, lots of moving around, rental\nhouses, changing drivers,'' Frank said.\n\n   Police confiscated about $3 million worth of counterfeit\nsoftware during a raid at one house. Dummy bank accounts and shell\ncompanies hid paper trails, but Frank said police had information\nthat ``people at the highest portions of the organization were\nshipping a half-million dollars a month to banks in Taiwan and the\nPeople's Republic of China.''\n\n   Frank said the counterfeiting was part of a Chinese syndicate\nbut also involved Laotian and Vietnamese immigrants. The\ninvestigation is still open, but so far, 11 people have been\nconvicted on federal counterfeiting charges stemming from the case,\nFrank said. Federal indictments also were returned against three\nother people who are believed to be somewhere in Asia, Frank said.\n\n        Investigators have on rare occasions encountered dangerous\nsituations in software piracy cases. In 1995, investigators joining\npolice looking into a case of counterfeit Microsoft software raided\na home that had an AK-47 rifle and plastic explosives, said\nMicrosoft attorney Anne Murphy, who heads that company's\nanti-piracy unit.\n\n   Other investigations have turned up smaller operations. ``We did\none this year in Indianapolis where an individual was\ncounterfeiting software and selling it at the Indiana state\nfairgrounds,'' the Autodesk investigator said.\n\n   In a case cracked in 1995, a Southern California man sold\npirated Autodesk AutoCAD for as low as $500 by advertising in free\nnewspapers or selling at convenience store parking lots. The man\nonce made a deal out of the back of his old Honda at a shopping\ncenter in Corte Madera.\n\n   Autodesk kept track because some of the customers would try to\nregister the software, which carried the same registration code,\nonly to learn that it was counterfeit.\n\n   ``What did they think they were buying?'' the Autodesk\ninvestigator said. ``Autodesk does not sell products through flea\nmarkets or auctions or 7-Eleven parking lots.''\n\n   Pirates who advertise their wares on the Internet also pose a\nproblem, and some software companies have investigators who\nconstantly are scouring the Web.\n\n   ``We've got a case right now that is driving us to\ndistraction,'' said Sandra Boulton, Autodesk's director of piracy\nprevention. In this case, a pirate in Russia selling through the\nWeb seems to appear ``everywhere'' but may be difficult to\nprosecute because intellectual-property-rights laws aren't as\nstrong there, she said.\n","Headline":"\nPIRATES OF THE CD-ROM \n","Text":["\n   He responded to the scene, a print shop in the Orange County\ntown of Westminster.\n","\n   There, he picked up a trail that led him and his partner,\nDetective Tommy Rackleff, into a seamy underworld involving\ninternational smuggling, money laundering, back-alley deals and\norganized crime.\n","\n   After months of stakeouts and talking to confidential\ninformants, Frank and Rackleff arrested 11 suspects, recovered more\nthan $3 million worth of illegal booty and disrupted an elaborate\ndistribution network that stretched from California to Asia.\n","\n   But these weren't vicious drug dealers or gun smugglers.
