Japanese\nwarships and planes continued to pursue the other early Wednesday.\n\n   There is no proof of where the ships came from. But Japanese\ngovernment officials clearly suspect North Korea of the\ninfiltration.

So the reaction strongly suggested that Japanese\nofficials had intelligence about the vessels that they were not\nsharing.\n\n   The incident underscores Japan's increasing assertiveness in\nsecurity affairs and may complicate relations between the West and\nNorth Korea.

The Japanese\nMaritime Safety Agency, roughly the equivalent of the U.S. Coast\nGuard, said it spotted one ship on Tuesday morning 28 miles east of\nthe Noto Peninsula in central Japan, on the side facing the Korean\npeninsula.\n\n   Then, officials said, the Maritime Self-Defense Forces\ndispatched a destroyer, the first time that it had done so, and the\nsecond vessel was found. The authorities did not explain why they\nfelt compelled to dispatch destroyers to investigate or what they\nfound mysterious about the ships.\n\n   The vessels were about 100 feet long and bore the names of real\nJapanese fishing boats. Transport Minister Jiro Kawasaki told\nreporters that one boat used the name of a vessel that was sailing\nelsewhere and that the other used the name of a boat that was no\nlonger operating.\n\n   Military officials also dispatched three destroyers and an\nairplane to track the ships, and Maritime Safety Agency patrol\nboats joined the chase. The patrol boats fired more than 1,200\nrounds of warning shots from machine guns on two occasions on\nTuesday night, more than 100 miles from Sado Island.\n\n   It was the first time Japan had fired warning shots at sea since\n1953, when a patrol boat fired off the bow of a Soviet spy ship\nnear the northern island of Hokkaido.\n\n   The warning shots were intended to force the two boats to stop\nfor boarding. But they continued at a very high speed that\nsuggested they had been fitted for military purposes rather than\nfishing.
