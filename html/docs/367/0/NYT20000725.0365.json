I remember being asked to\napprove a live recording of the Third Rachmaninoff, which I knew\nhad something good about it, but I couldn't stop feeling upset by\nthe smudges. Recording makes me nervous. It's enough to deal with\nan audience. It was 10 years before I let the tape of the\nRachmaninoff Second Sonata go.'' Which, of course, is now regarded\nas one of his best recordings.\n\n   He describes hearing William Kapell play Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody\non a Theme of Paganini at Lewisohn Stadium in New York in 1953,\njust before Kapell was killed in a plane crash. Cliburn didn't see\nthe point even of learning the piece after that performance,\ndeclining invitations to play it for years, until Eugene Ormandy,\nhis friend, who had conducted Rachmaninoff playing it, finally\ncoaxed him in 1970.\n\n   He did it partly to be accommodating. That has been his problem\nsometimes. When people have clamored to hear him play what he is\nalready famous for, he has. Critics who have heard the Tchaikovsky\nconcerto over and over again may be bored by it, but most people\nrarely hear it live and will get to hear Cliburn play it live only\nonce. And he has known that.\n\n   It's nearly 4 a.m. now, and he is on the sofa, reminiscing,\nwhich can be an uncontrollable phenomenon. Ask him why, after\nwinning in Moscow, he went to study with Bruno Walter and he\nrecalls playing the Prokofiev Third on Dimitri Mitropoulos' piano,\nthen describes what he calls an unremarkable conducting stint in\n1963. The stories, although familiar, are to say the least\nexceptional, but it's not clear by the end exactly what he learned\nfrom Walter.\n\n   Or what he learned from Rosina Lhevinne, which is another\nquestion put to him: ``One of the things I distinctly remember was\nbeing a little early for a lesson and she was playing, and I opened\nthe double doors to the studio and heard her play Chopin's `Aeolian\nHarp' Etude _ oh my, as if from heaven!'' Yes, but about the\nlessons? ``Well, I remember she wanted tempi faster sometimes.''\n\n   So Cliburn gives the impression of being utterly content now and\nnot too inclined to excavate the past afresh. He lets on at one\npoint, as if revealing a deep family secret, that he's thinking\nabout performing Bach again, the E minor Partita, maybe, and he\nfloats a program for a scheduled Chopin recital in Boston that is\nso preposterously long that it sounds like a fantasy of a young\npianist in the first flush of success _ as if, no matter how\nstressful the stage may have been all those years, it is still the\nlocus of his imagination.\n\n   How much is enough for a career?\n\n   Only he has the right to say, of course. His place in history is\nreserved. Cliburn, who spent years living out of a suitcase in\nhotels, a born performer but a private man, having made several\nlandmark albums, now plays when he wants, if not always at the\nlevel he did when he was young and playing all the time. He lives\nin a real house, cooks for pleasure, socializes, does nothing if he\nfeels like it, goes to the opera, travels constantly without\nobligations.\n\n   Among the mementos on the piano is a snapshot of Vladimir\nAshkenazy, the pianist, who once said: ``Van is what he is; he is\nnot pretending to be anything else.
