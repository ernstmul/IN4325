Times News Service   \n\n   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ If you had not visited this city of\ndreamy minarets and dazzling skyscrapers before last week, you\nmight wonder whether the Asian crisis ever happened.\n\n   On Tuesday, Malaysia's leaders dedicated the Petronas Twin\nTowers, a futuristic colossus that is the world's tallest building.\nAs fireworks blazed and laser beams pierced the night skies, the\nprime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, declared, ``We need something to\nexpress our towering ambition.''\n\n   Malaysia did suffer a humbling economic collapse, of course, as\nthe half-empty towers attest. But with the country now showing\nsigns of a robust recovery, Mahathir is exuding victory and\nvindication.\n\n   Unlike its neighbors, Malaysia chose to fend off the Asian\ntyphoon by boarding up its windows. Drawing the wrath of the\nfree-market West, it imposed sweeping controls on its capital\nmarkets _ suspending off-shore trading in its currency and locking\nforeign capital in the country for a year.\n\n   Mahathir says the moves protected Malaysia from the predations\nof foreign currency traders. Without controls, he says, the traders\nwould have caused wild swings in the currency, which could have\ndecimated the economy and ignited social unrest in this multiracial\nsociety. Business people here initially balked, but most now rally\naround the prime minister.\n\n   ``We did not implode as a society. There were no mass riots on\nthe streets, as in Indonesia,'' said Francis Yeoh, an\nethnic-Chinese tycoon who is one of Malaysia's richest men. ``It is\nnot half-vindication, it is full vindication.''\n\n   On Wednesday, Malaysia relaxed its rules on the repatriation of\ncapital. Now, as foreign investors weigh whether to pour money back\ninto Malaysia, Mahathir's policy is getting another hearing.\nEconomists, fund managers, business people and even officials at\nthe International Monetary Fund acknowledge that Mahathir appears\nto have won his risky gamble.\n\n   To be sure, most economists and policy-makers still view capital\ncontrols with deep skepticism. They say that shutting off markets\nand freezing currencies can strangle investment and cause damaging\ndistortions.\n\n   Hubert Neiss, director of Asia-Pacific operations at the IMF,\nsaid at a seminar in Tokyo this week that Malaysia's recovery had\nlittle to do with the controls. But he also said Malaysia should\nnot be condemned for the move.\n\n   Other economists say Mahathir has proved that controls can be\nuseful in dire situations.\n\n   ``There was always a case for capital controls in principle\nduring a crisis,'' said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wrote an influential\narticle defending controls in Fortune magazine on the eve of\nMalaysia's announcement.\n\n   ``The argument was that they were impractical _ that they would\ninevitably screw up the real economy,'' he said. ``What Malaysia\nhas shown is that they are actually more workable than everyone\nclaimed.''\n\n   Certainly, Malaysia's performance has confounded skeptics, who\npredicted the controls would deplete reserves and stop the economy\nin its tracks. After contracting 6.7 percent last year, Malaysia's\ngross domestic product rose 4.1 percent in the second quarter. The\ncountry's reserves, far from diminishing, have shot up 60 percent,\nto $32 billion, since August 1998.\n\n   ``If you do not like or trust statistics, just visit the shops\nand restaurants,'' said a defiant Mahathir in a speech here this\nweek. ``Only, give yourself a little extra time _ because I am\nafraid the traffic jams have come back.''\n\n   The prime minister also noted that relatively little capital has\nflowed out of the country since the controls were relaxed _ defying\nthose who had said that Malaysia would be hit by wholesale capital\nflight on Sept. 1.\n\n   Critics say, however, that his arguments have a few holes.\nThailand and Korea are rebounding even more quickly than Malaysia,\ndespite leaving their markets open and allowing their currencies to\nfluctuate. And while billions of dollars of foreign capital have\nnot stampeded out of the country, that is partly because most of it\nhad fled before Malaysia imposed the controls.\n\n   So the question remains: Was Malaysia smart or lucky?\n\n   ``They got lucky because they put the controls on just as\npressure lifted off the other regional currencies,'' said David\nDevine, a director at Overlook, an investment fund based in Hong\nKong.\n\n   If the currencies in Thailand, Korea and Indonesia had continued\nto fall after Malaysia had imposed its controls, Devine said,\nMalaysia's currency, the ringgit, would have been overvalued. That\nwould have undercut the country's exports and created a black\nmarket in ringgit.\n\n   In fact, the opposite happened. Because the Thai baht and the\nIndonesian rupiah rose while the ringgit was fixed to the U.S.\ndollar at 3.8 to the dollar, Malaysia's currency became relatively\ncheap. That made Malaysia's exports _ led by computers and\nperipherals _ extremely competitive.\n\n   ``The country's exports were plummeting until August 1998,''\nsaid P.K. Basu, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in\nSingapore. ``They stabilized in August and started roaring in\nSeptember.''\n\n   Critics said Malaysia had permanently alienated foreign funds _\nthe same people who bankrolled its economic development by pouring\nmoney into the country for much of the 1990s. And there are some\ninvestors who say they plan to steer clear of Malaysia, regardless\nof its newly relaxed rules.\n\n   ``Essentially, you've got a government that makes its own\nrules,'' said Henry Lee, the managing director of Hendale Asia, an\ninvestment fund in Hong Kong. ``We've exited because we see a lot\nof problems there.''\n\n   But an informal survey of regional money managers in Asia\nindicates that more people may think like Devine of Overlook. He\nsaid he would put money back in Malaysia, provided he could earn a\ndecent return. ``My view is that the investment community has a\nshort memory,'' he said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   In any event, it is not clear that Malaysia even wants\nshort-term capital to return. As part of its new rules, it\ninstituted a tax on investment profits that heavily favors\nforeigners who leave their money in the country for at least a\nyear. And Mahathir is hardly putting out the welcome mat.\n\n   ``I know some foreign fund managers are pessimistic, but to me,\nit doesn't matter very much,'' he said after his speech.\n\n   Foreign companies with operations in Malaysia, like Intel and\nDell Computer, have not been harmed by the controls. They were\nexempt from the bans on moving money in and out of the country. In\nfact, some executives say the ringgit's fixed-exchange rate made it\na bit easier to do planning.\n\n   When Mahathir imposed the controls, he said they would give the\ncountry desperately needed breathing space to repair its economy.\nThere was, and is, plenty to do: Many of Malaysia's banks are\ninsolvent. And its corporations are a catalog of dubious business\npractices, prospering on their connections to politicians and\nplowing billions of dollars into reckless projects.\n\n   The state oil company, Petronas, spent $800 million to build the\nPetronas Twin Towers. Although they were completed in 1996, they\nare only now attracting tenants. Petronas is also the lead investor\nin Putrajaya, Malaysia's new capital city. A pet project of\nMahathir, the city is being built from scratch for $5.2 billion in\na palm plantation south of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n   While Malaysia has made a few strides _ whittling down the\nnumber of bad loans in its banks to a creditable 12.8 percent of\nthe total loan portfolio _ analysts here said Mahathir's record as\na reformer is paltry.\n\n   ``He has abused this window of opportunity to save his cronies,\nrather than undertaking the reforms that are necessary,'' said K.S.\nJomo, a political economist at the University of Malaya.\n\n   Jomo is particularly critical of a recently announced plan to\nconsolidate Malaysia's 21 commercial banks, 25 finance companies\nand 12 merchant banks into six large banking groups. The mergers\nfavor bankers allied with Daim Zainuddin, the powerful finance\nminister, while punishing those friendly with the ousted deputy\nprime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.\n\n   Malaysia's economic policy has been accompanied by Draconian\npolitical moves from the beginning. Mahathir dismissed Anwar, his\nheir apparent, the day after he announced the controls. Anwar, who\nhad opposed the measures, was subsequently sentenced to six years\nin jail on corruption charges that his defenders say were trumped\nup. He is now standing trial on a charge of sodomy, which he\ndenies.\n\n   Mahathir's heavy-handed treatment of his former protege\nunleashed a storm of protest in this normally placid country. While\nthe street protests were not deadly as in Indonesia, they gave\nbirth to the most serious opposition movement the prime minister\nhas faced in his 18 years in power.\n\n   The protests also echoed abroad. In a report issued this week,\nAmnesty International, the human rights group, said, ``Step by\nstep, the Malaysian government has undermined constitutional\nprotection, weakened key institutions and put in place an array of\nrestrictive laws that stifle public debate and dissent.''\n\n   Mahathir responded by asking why Amnesty International did not\ninvestigate the behavior of currency traders. Such sarcasm is\ntypical of the 73-year-old prime minister, who seems to delight in\nthumbing his nose at the global political and financial\nestablishment.\n\n   In his speech, Mahathir reserved his most acerbic lines for the\nIMF. He said the fund had worsened the crisis in Thailand, Korea\nand Indonesia by insisting on high interest rates and deep cuts in\ngovernment spending. By shunning the IMF, he said Malaysia had\navoided impoverishing its people and handing over its corporate\ncrown jewels to foreigners.\n\n   ``We have been able to achieve what others have achieved,''\nMahathir said, ``without having to sell our family silver and\nprecious heirlooms, without having to auction off our precious\ncorporations to foreigners at fire-sale prices, and without having\nto bend or bow to anyone.''\n\n   For all of Mahathir's claims, he has not swayed his neighbors.\nThailand, Korea and Indonesia have left their markets open. Few\nAsian leaders even seem in the mood to debate the issue. The\nInstitute of Strategic and International Studies, a research group\nhere, had hoped to draw top officials from around the region to a\nsymposium this week on capital controls. Most declined the\ninvitation.\n\n   If Mahathir was trying to be the pied piper of the emerging\nmarkets, however, it was scarcely evident in his remarks.\n\n   ``We were and are fortunate that no one has followed or said\nthey intend to follow Malaysia's example,'' he declared. ``A\nheretic can be tolerated. But a heresy cannot.''\n","Headline":"\nMALAYSIA WINS ITS ECONOMIC GAMBLE \n","Text":["\n   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ If you had not visited this city of\ndreamy minarets and dazzling skyscrapers before last week, you\nmight wonder whether the Asian crisis ever happened.\n","\n   On Tuesday, Malaysia's leaders dedicated the Petronas Twin\nTowers, a futuristic colossus that is the world's tallest building.\nAs fireworks blazed and laser beams pierced the night skies, the\nprime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, declared, ``We need something to\nexpress our towering ambition.''\n","\n   Malaysia did suffer a humbling economic collapse, of course, as\nthe half-empty towers attest.
