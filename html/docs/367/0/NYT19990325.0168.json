NICHOLS   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   DVD Showing Its Strength\n\n   Late last year, signs in store windows summed it up: DVD is\nhere. After a sputtering start in 1997, more than 2,500 films were\navailable on the compact digital video disk and more than 1 million\nplayers had been sold. Where do things stand?\n\n   ``There's been safe growth _ the key word is safe,'' said Martin\nGreenwald, president of Image Entertainment, a large distributor of\nthe disks. Safe is defined in two ways: The public is taking to the\nnew format in promising numbers, and the studios are not flooding\nthe market with too many disks.\n\n   Suppliers like Greenwald measure success by returns from\nretailers, which are low. ``That's the sign of a very healthy\nmarketplace,'' he said.\n\n   Industry sources say that DVD is adding 80,000 to 90,000\nhouseholds a month. The format is making particularly large strides\nin chains like Tower and West Coast Video, a predominantly East\nCoast chain that has a reputation for innovation. Steven Apple, a\nvice president, said that 10 percent of West Coast inventory was\nDVD, a high figure for such a new line.\n\n   Dealers everywhere report keen consumer interest in new and\nolder films on DVD and an increasingly strong inclination to rent\ndisks as one would videocassettes. ``Initially, DVD is a sales item\nbecause people want to immediately build a little library when they\nbuy the player,'' Apple said. ``Now that they have owned the\nplayers for a year in some cases, they're interested in renting as\nthey would traditionally.''\n\n   Heroism Amid the Flak\n\n   Before World War II, William Wyler directed films like\n``Wuthering Heights'' and ``The Westerner.'' During the conflict,\nhe jumped on a B-17 called the Memphis Belle and made a documentary\nthat stirred the country and brought tears to the eyes of Franklin\nD. Roosevelt.\n\n   The Belle was flying its 25th and last mission into Germany\nbefore the crew would return to the United States. Wyler crawled\naround the aircraft with a hand-held camera recording a\nheart-stopping and often strangely beautiful drama, ``The Memphis\nBelle,'' that stands up very well today on a tape from Antiquary\nVideo.\n\n   The mission was to bomb naval installations at Wilhelmshaven on\nthe North Sea. ``The Hun is expecting us,'' rumbles the rhetorical\nnarration written for the folks at home. Bombers climb to freezing\nheights and are strung across clear azure skies. Flak starts\narriving in black puffs and gradually fills the sky.\n\n   The hardest part is the flight back to England. German fighters\ncome from everywhere. A 19-year-old waist gunner blazes away in all\ndirections. An engine is on fire. At the airfield, ground crews\ncount the returning planes. Colored flares signal ambulances from\nB-17s carrying wounded. ``It's lost its nose,'' the narrator says\nof one craft. ``The navigator is dead. The pilot is wounded. The\nbombardier is wounded. There are no brakes, no flaps. The hydraulic\nsystem is shot out.''\n\n   Not on the Memphis Belle, however, which returns safely. Wyler's\nfilm was reviewed on Page 1 of The New York Times on April 14,\n1944.\n\n   Information: (800) 225-0208.\n\n   New Releases\n\n   ``Everest''\n\n   Removed from the eight-story-high Imax theater screen, David\nBreashears' and Greg MacGillivray's account of the storied 1996\nclimb loses visual grandeur but still stands up as an account of a\nbrutal experience even for those who made it to the summit. Everest\ntakes everything to extremes. One climber is so badly wracked by\ncoughing fits that she cracks ribs. With the wind chill at minus\n100 degrees, another climber is rendered temporarily blind and\nlater will have both hands amputated. At 20,000 feet rescue\nhelicopters lose control because their blades don't have enough air\nto bite. Eight people from one party die. Others reach the summit,\nhowever, including the production team who, Lawrence Van Gelder\nwrote in The New York Times, shot an ``absorbing film and a story\nof hope and hubris.''  \n\n   1995. Miramax. $19.99. 48 minutes. No rating. Release date:\nMarch 30.\n\n   ``The Rugrats Movie''\n\n   The talking babies of the Nickelodeon series try to get used to\nthe newborn addition in their midst, Dylan Preston (Dil) Pickles,\nbut find him unacceptably assertive right off the starting block.\nAttempting to turn him back in, the Rugrats hop a ride in a\nmattress truck, which crashes and spills them into a forest full of\ndanger. As in any such woodlands, there's a ravenous wolf, and in\nthis case a crazy bunch of circus monkeys who make off with Dil.\nGiven the popularity of the series, it's a movie that had to\nhappen. ``The pleasant surprise is that the film is a delight''\n(Anita Gates).\n\n   1998. Paramount. $26.95. 80 minutes. Closed captioned. G.\nRelease date: March 30.\n\n   ``Home Fries''\n\n   Serving as a reminder of how much Hollywood could use some good\nscrewball comedy, Dean Parisot's film at least reaches for a\nbizarre situation. Sally (Drew Barrymore) is a waitress at the\nlocal Burger-Matic and pregnant with the baby of a married man. The\nwife of the father-to-be gets his two stepsons to buzz him in a\nhelicopter in order to scare him into mending his ways. Instead he\ndies of fright. Suspecting that Sally can implicate them, one of\nthe stepsons (Luke Wilson) takes a job at the Burger-Matic and\nfalls in love with her. Well, the story ``at least has the right\nattitude. It just isn't funny enough in its particulars'' (Stephen\nHolden).\n\n   1998. Warner. $107.37. 93 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.\nRelease date: March 30.\n\n   ``Safe Men''\n\n   Two failed singers (Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn) from\nProvidence, R.I., are mistaken for a pair of safecrackers (Mark\nRuffalo and Josh Pais) and are conned into grabbing an easy\n$300,000 from an old man's safe. But that puts them under the thumb\nof a local mob boss (Michael Lerner), which leads to their\nparticipation in other jobs. Unfortunately, nothing grabs the\nattention in a film that ``is far longer on dull talk than\ninventively comic action'' (Van Gelder).\n\n   1998. Universal. $99.36. 94 minutes. Closed captioned. R.\n\n   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a\ntheater release at one time, appeared on television or been on\nvideocassette in earlier editions:\n\n   ``TERROR 2000.'' Christoph Schlingensief's punk expressionist\nfable lampoons neo-Nazism and xenophobia in contemporary Germany.\nLooking into the disappearance of a social worker who was escorting\nPolish immigrants to a refugee camp, a husband-and-wife detective\nteam run into one crazy adventure after another. Imagine, Stephen\nHolden wrote in The New York Times, a Keystone Kops film ``written\nby ``William S. Burroughs, peopled with characters from George\nGrosz by way of Russ Meyer and directed in a style that suggests\nJean-Luc Godard on speed.'' 1994. Water Bearer. $29.95. 79 minutes.\nGerman with English subtitles. Release date: March 30. Information:\n(800) 551-8304.\n\n   ``THE BLACK HOLE.'' It took ``Star Wars'' to launch Gary\nNelson's film about a madman who tries to fly a space ship into a\nblack hole. Accomplished special effects are the story here.
