Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ It's a Saturday evening in the East Village, and the\nstreets are pulsing with bar-hopping young people. But Candace\nWalsh and her posse of girlfriends _ most of them artists and\nwriters in their 20s and 30s, mostly single _ have gathered in her\none-bedroom apartment for Beauty Parlor Night.\n\n   The coffee table is scattered with powder puffs, nail files and\nhot-pink Hard Candy nail polish. A mix tape of '80s pop songs\nblasts in the background, as Shelby Gates, a freelance\nphotographer, describes how a police officer recently ejected her\nfrom a subway station for conducting a photo shoot without a\npermit.\n\n   ``Isn't that annoying,'' she says, smearing a mask of\nmoisterizing lotion on the face of Tiffany Licorish, a production\nartist at an advertizing agency.\n\n   The talk ricochets from bad bosses to recent books to body hair.\nAlthough the monthly Beauty Parlor Nights are distant descendants\nof consciousness-raising groups, Ms. Walsh, a writer, drew on an\naltogether different inspiration when organizing the gatherings:\nthe slumber parties of her adolescence. Surveying the roomful of\nwet toe nails and masked faces, someone asks skeptically, ``Has\nfeminism taught us anything?''\n\n   ``Yes,'' replies Barbara Stone, a make-up artist who works for\nBobbi Brown. ``It's taught us to take care of ourselves. It's the\nnew `Our Bodies Ourselves.' ''\n\n   Part career and romance support group, part retro coffee klatch,\na new genre of women's group has been emerging, one that emphasizes\nthe role of gossip and ``girl talk'' as much as weightier subjects\nin the life of the '90s woman. The gatherings draw from such\npost-feminist touchstones as ``The View,'' the all-woman daytime\ntalk show with Barbara Walters that mixes serious news with\noff-color sex chat, and ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,''\nthe best-selling novel that tells of a 40-year-old career woman who\nlongs for the female friendships that her mother enjoyed.\n\n   The new groups meet in Brooklyn lofts and at the Cosmos Club in\nWashington, a bastion of inside-the-Beltway power. Not all meet in\nperson. Web-based women's communities have sprung up like iVillage\nand Chickclick, where recent discussion topics included Madeline\nAlbright and one titled ``Underwear: granny style, bikini or\nthong?''\n\n   ``I live in an all-men's world so I never get to do girl talk,''\nsaid Dr. Florence Haseltine, 56, the director of the Center for\nPopulation Research, who started the monthly Cosmos Club dinners\nfor high-ranking women in the Clinton administration in 1992. ``In\na group with men, women tend to feel they have to talk about more\nweighty topics. But one of the biggest weighty topics is that women\nin Washington don't gossip enough. What I mean is exchange\ninformation about the unwritten rules and about who you can and\ncannot trust.''\n\n   ``Divine Secrets of The Ya Ya Sisterhood'' by Rebecca Wells has\ninspired close to 35 Ya-Ya groups across the country, patterned on\nthe sisterhood portrayed in the 1996 novel, which has more than two\nmillion copies in print.\n\n   Leighanne Bramlett, 26, an aspiring actress from Louisiana who\nmoved to New York a year ago, formed a Ya-Ya group with two other\nNew Yorkers she met through a Web site devoted to the book. ``New\nYork is so cutthroat, and there are so many distractions,'' Ms.\nBramlett said. ``It's hard to establish the level of friendship\nthat you had with girls when you were a kid. Our group is about\nunconditional friendship.''\n\n   A nostalgia for the bonding and values of early and\npre-adolescence, when girls have been shown by some studies to\nexhibit self-confidence they later loose, flavors many of the new\nwomen's groups. It is the same sensibility that spawned the ``girl\npower'' slogan of the Spice Girls and post-feminist zines like\nSmile and Act Nice, Wench and Bust (``the voice of the new girl\norder,'' it calls itself), all of whose Web sites are linked to\nChickClick.\n\n   Nikol Lore, 28, the editor in chief of Smile and Act Nice, is\nplanning a group of women's slumber parties around the country this\nsummer that will be connected through her Web site. ``It's an\neducated return to those girly gatherings of our adolescence'' she\nsaid. ``As we get older, women get away from that kind of\nbonding.''\n\n   Meanwhile, Abby Weintraub, 28, a book jacket designer at Random\nHouse and a graduate of Brown University, has been hosting a\nregular Ladies Night at her apartment in the West Village for the\npast two years. ``In college, we were together all the time in\ngroups, but now that we're older and more people are pairing up, so\nit's important to set aside a time to be alone with the girls,''\nMs. Weintraub said.\n\n   And recently Belinda Miller, 33, a deejay at WFMU radio in New\nJersey, organized an all-women clothing swap for 40 friends at\nMaxwells in Hoboken. She plans to make it a yearly tradition.\n``It's not that we want to be our grandmothers and go back to\nsingle-sex activities,'' Ms. Miller said. ``It's just that it's\nimportant to be with the girls and talk about goofy stuff and walk\naround in your bra and underwear.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n     \nnn\n\n   Claiming a right to such indulgences without being accused of\nbeing reactionary is a typical stance in this post-feminist moment.\nThe agenda of the new groups is a mix of the everyday and the\nfrivolous _ parenting advice and beauty tips _ but almost never the\npolitical. ``It's used to be about getting angry, now it's much\nmore practical,'' says Nancy Evans, the editor in chief of\niVillage, a popular Web site for women that recently sold stock to\nthe public for the first time and saw its founders become paper\nmillionaires. ``Women don't have time to gab at the beauty parlor\nanymore and they can't meet over the backyard fence because the\nperson on the other side is at work,'' Ms. Evans added.\n\n   Marla Walker, 30, a children's television producer, and Caroline\nSchutz, also 30, a musician, have convened the Williamsburg Ladies\nClub in Brooklyn for two and one-half years. They chose their\nold-fashioned name to distance themselves from doctrinaire\nfeminists who spell ``women'' with a ``y.'' They insist they are\nnot a consciousness-raising group. ``Our consciousness is already\nraised,'' Ms. Schutz, a graduate of the Spence School and Oberlin\nCollege, said. ``We know there is still inequality, but this is\nmore about just being with each other alone.''\n\n   At the same time, the Williamsburg Ladies Club _ five of whose\nmembers met recently for conversation that ranged from Monica\nLewinsky to venereal diseases to foot ailments _ insists it is not\njust a modern-day canasta club or tea party. ``If you asked any of\nus if we were feminists we would all say yes, but we would just\nnever call it a group with a women's agenda,'' Ms. Schutz said.\n``Of course we do talk about important women's issues such as\ntrading health information. We're much more connected to\nconsciousness raising groups than we are to Tupperware parties.''\n\n   Ms. Walker said: ``Now that we have our jobs and our freedom to\ndo anything, we're learning that it's impossible to have it all. So\ntalking among ourselves is a way of choosing other roles. There's a\ncertain amount of intimacy in our girl time that let's you talk\nabout anything.''\n\n   ``Girl'' and ``girl talk'' are still loaded phrases for many\nwomen, of course, especially those over 35 who remember the\ndemeaning use of the words in the past. Feminists of the '60s and\n'70s campaigned to banish ``girl'' as a term for adult women. But\nmany younger women embrace it and its constellation of associations\n_ from the power of women's sexuality to dominate men through\nhistory, as argued by Camille Paglia, to the warm and fuzzy\nmemories of girlhood friendships.\n\n   ``Girl-talk is a way of measuring your own experience. It's\nabout letting your hair down in a place where you're not taking on\na role as a worker or a wife or a mother,'' said Peggy Orenstein,\nthe author of the 1994 book ``School Girls: Young Women, Self\nEsteem and the Confidence Gap.'' Last year she began interviewing\nsmall groups of women for a book about women's life choices from\ntheir mid-20s to mid-40s.\n\n   ``I saw in these groups that women have a yearning to connect\nwith other women,'' she said. ``And whether women believe it or\nnot, girl talk is also inherently political, and inherently\nsubversive because historically there's been so little value placed\non what t means to be a caretaker, or a wife or a female worker.''\n\n   Whether as inspiration or mirror of a trend already underway,\n``The View'' with five women hosts of different generations has\nbuilt a strong following. The show was inspired by an early-1960s\nnews show called ``Girl Talk'' starring Virginia Graham. ``The\nshow's format is somewhat old-fashioned,'' Bill Geddie, a\nco-executive producer, said. ``But I think it's a sign that women\nhave come full circle. Now that women have proved that they can\nhold their own in a man's world, it's safe and there is a need to\nhave a show where women act like women. It's okay to use the word\n`girl-talk' again.''\n\n   ``It's is a sign of progress that women can do a serious story\nabout women in Afghanistan and then talk about nail polish in the\nsame show,'' he added.\n\n   Five or 10 years ago, the format might have made serious\nnewswomen worry about appearing too frivolous. But now even Barbara\nWalters lets her hair down with ``the girls.'' The day before she\ninterviewed Monica Lewinsky for ``20/20,'' Ms. Walters' ``View''\nco-host Meredith Vieira handed out thongs to the other women on the\nshow. Ms. Walters placed hers on her head. ``Does it have a look?''\nshe joked.\n\n   Even traditional feminists are embracing the shift. For a brunch\nto celebrate the relaunch of Ms. magazine under new ownership\nMonday, an invitation asks women to gather to discuss ``money,\npower, liberty, politics, facts 'n' facelifts.''\n\n   Gloria Steinem, Ms.'s founder, maintains that '70s-era women's\ngroups had plenty in common with today's. ``The early\nconsciousness-raising groups were fun and full of jokes and bawdy\nand crazy and serious,'' she said. ``They were everything.
