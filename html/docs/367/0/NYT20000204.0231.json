EDITORS: FOR THOSE DESIRING A SHORTER VERSION, THIS ARTICLE\nOFFERS TWO EDITOR-FRIENDLY OPTIONAL TRIMS, TOTALING 575 WORDS.\nTOTAL UNCUT IS 1,400.)  \n  \n (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted into the ``f''\nfinancial news, ``a'' domestic/general news and ``k'' commentary\nnews files.)  \n  \n c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  \n (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  \n\n   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 28 Europe's air-traffic control\nbosses met some 38 transport ministers to unblock the continent's\ngridlocked skies.\n\n   Europe's antiquated air-traffic control is fragmented into 49\ncenters and 31 national systems. Its hardware uses 30 programming\nlanguages and 22 operating systems.\n\n   A third of all flights are delayed by more than 15 minutes, at a\ncost to airlines and passengers of some $10 billion a year.\n\n   This latest summit was the sixth since the summer of 1989, when\ndelays in southern Europe almost brought the entire system to a\nhalt. But if past efforts are anything to go by, the talks are\nlikely to make about as much progress as a jumbo stacked up over\nHeathrow.\n\n   Fragmentation is not the only problem facing air-traffic\ncontrollers. Although America has a single system of air-traffic\ncontrol, it too has seen delays climb steadily for five years.\n\n   The cause is, simply, a booming market in air travel. Europe and\nAmerica may see a doubling of air travel over the next 10-15 years.\n\n   According to Xavier Fron of Eurocontrol, which tries to\ncoordinate European air-traffic control, if capacity stays\nconstant, every 1 percent rise in traffic produces a 5 percent\nincrease in delays. So, unless air-traffic control improves hugely,\ndelays will grow longer and more frequent _ until demand is choked\noff by the sheer hassle of flying.\n\n   Safety is also at stake. So far, although the public-sector\nmentality of air-traffic control has failed to respond to demand,\ncaution has at least ensured safety.\n\n   Yet controllers reckon that the risk of a collision rises as a\nsquare of any increase in traffic. This means that, if air traffic\ndoubles, a collision becomes four times as likely. If the number of\ndeaths from flying is not to rise dramatically, some way will have\nto be found to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n   All this spells a need for overhaul and investment for which\nneither Europe nor America show any sign of preparedness.   \n     \n\n     (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350)      \n     \n\n   Take Europe first. Europe's airlines were excluded from last\nweek's meeting, even though passengers tend to blame them for\ndelays. An earlier meeting, on Jan. 12, between airline bosses and\nair-traffic controllers turned into a dogfight as the businessmen\nstacked up to aim salvoes at the bureaucrats.\n\n   To the airlines' fury, controllers were promising merely to try\nto make this summer's delays no worse than those of 1997.\n\n   Airline bosses such as Xavier de Irala of Iberia, who heads the\nAssociation of European Airlines, and Jurgen Weber of Lufthansa,\nweighed in with calls for a zero-defect approach to air-traffic\ncontrol, the standard that airlines expect from their other\nsuppliers.\n\n   Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, accused\nEurocontrol of a Soviet-style attitude, with its calls for\ncollaboration in ``strategic planning of demand.''\n\n   In theory the current mess should never have started. Forty\nyears ago, Europe planned to run air-traffic control through only\nthree centers, Shannon in western Ireland, Karlsruhe in Germany and\nMaastricht, where Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany meet.\n\n   The entire continent was to be overseen by Eurocontrol. But\nEuropean governments refused to compromise their own airspace\n(about as acceptable as a European army, comments one controller).\n\n   Thus Europe's air-traffic control is condemned to work at the\nspeed of its slowest member, as pilots are handed over from one\ncountry's system to another every 30-60 minutes.\n\n   Eurocontrol runs only the Maastricht center, doing its pitiful\nbest to choreograph the other parts of the system. The rest of the\ntime it is little more than a talking-shop.   \n     \n\n     (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM)      \n     \n\n   The European Commission is trying to bash heads together, but\nEurope's single market does not yet show much sign of becoming a\nsingle sky.\n\n   Demands for change are growing in America, too. Congestion is\nespecially bad in the northeastern corner of the United States,\nwhere it is approaching European levels.\n\n   Making matters worse in America is the growing use of small\nregional jet aircraft to feed from small towns into airport hubs.\n\n   Although these aircraft fly faster and higher in the busy jet\nlanes than did their turbo-prop predecessors, they are still slower\nthan big jets. They act, in effect, like caravans holding up road\ntraffic.\n\n   Last summer, the entire country was in chaos. The trouble\nstarted in April when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nbegan installing new display monitors in control towers, beginning\nwith Seattle and working eastwards.\n\n   By the time the overhaul had reached the busy airspace between\nIndianapolis and Detroit, confusion was growing, as controllers\nwanted to feel their way with the new color displays.\n\n   To the surprise of the airlines, control towers began\nunilaterally to impose a separation of 60 nautical miles between\naircraft, irrespective of their altitude. Normally, safety dictates\nthat flights be separated by five nautical miles or 2,000 feet\nvertically.\n\n   Then the summer thunderstorms arrived. In busy airports, such as\nDetroit, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago's O'Hare, the number and\nduration of flight delays doubled. On average, 1,500 out of some\n22,000 scheduled airline flights a day were held up, leaving\n100,000 passengers fuming in lounges or sweltering on the hot\ntarmac.\n\n   The public outcry was bitter. The cost, according to the\nairlines, was about $5 billion for the industry and its customers.\n\n   By autumn, the air was thicker with accusations than aircraft.\nThe airlines blamed the FAA and the air-traffic controllers; the\nFAA blamed the sheer weight of traffic and federal-budget caps;\nand, for their part, the controllers (revealingly) blamed the\nairlines for scheduling so many flights at peak hours, when people\nactually want to fly.\n\n   ``We cannot afford to have that kind of summer again,'' says\nRodney Slater, America's transportation secretary.\n\n   His idea is to boost investment in America by getting airlines\nto pay user charges. Others were less restrained. There were calls\nfor an air passengers' ``bill of rights'' and, briefly, even some\ncongressional proposals for re-regulating air travel.\n\n   In successfully seeing off these threats, the airlines have\npromised to treat their delayed passengers better, by following a\nvoluntary code of conduct.\n\n   For its part, the FAA has admitted that it uses airspace\ninefficiently, responds slowly and clumsily to bad weather, and\nsuffers from procedures that vary from one region to the next. It\nhas also ordered an internal inquiry into air-traffic control.   \n      \n\n      (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,100. SECOND TRIM FOLLOWS TO 1,400)      \n\n     \n\n   What to do? Technology might help somewhat. The Americans are\ntrying to use e-mail for routine ground-to-air communication,\nfreeing voice channels and lightening the load for controllers.\n\n   Precise satellite navigation could remove the need for aircraft\nto fly longer routes that were partly designed around the old\nsystem of ground-radio beacons.\n\n   David Barrett, of Gemini Consulting in London, thinks that,\neventually, a solution would be to replace human air-traffic\ncontrollers with computers. It would also help if the controllers\nand airlines would learn to collaborate with each other.\n\n   From March 12, airline and FAA officials working from the FAA's\nnational control center at Herndon, Va., will work out how to react\nto the coming weather. They will update their plans every two\nhours, taking advantage of improvements to lift ground-holding\norders.\n\n   But administrative reforms are also needed. The priority in\nEurope should be a unified system. After 40 years of failure,\ngovernments and the EU are unlikely to achieve this quickly. But\nmaking air-traffic control more commercial might.\n\n   One possible way is to encourage successful air-traffic-control\nagencies to bid for the franchise to run national systems. Another\nidea is to create different levels of service, so that a business\nairline could pay to avoid delays that cheaper airlines might\ntolerate.\n\n   Nor should full privatization be taboo, so long as the\nresponsibility for safety is handed to an independent regulator.\n\n   Germany has followed Canada and New Zealand in making its\nair-traffic control commercial. Britain plans to go further by\nselling half the shares in its National Air Traffic Service to\nprivate investors. Yet such reforms remain the exception.\n\n   American airline bosses, such as Gordon Bethune of Continental\nAirlines and Don Carty of American Airlines, have called for\nAmerica's service to be privatized. But that is still a political\nnon-starter.\n\n   Although everyone accepts there is a problem, they are not yet\nready to accept the solution.   \n   ___________________      \n   (To publish this 825-word (trimmed) ECONOMIST article, it must be\npurchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times\nSyndicate sales representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or\nfax her at 732-390-4697.
