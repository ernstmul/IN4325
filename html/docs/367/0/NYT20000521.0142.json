Times News Service   \n\n   Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made\nhis name _ and a considerable fortune _ aggressively securing\nhundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for\nartists and studios that he represents. But his latest endeavor, a\npop-culture hub on the World Wide Web, has the potential to drain\nincome from some of those same clients by enabling users of the\nsite to copy music, media and other files from one another.\n\n   Last year, Ovitz and a business partner bought 51 percent of\nScour.com, an entertainment site and search engine used to find\nmusic and movie files. Last month, though, the site added a\nfeature, Scour Exchange, that lets users exchange multimedia files\nonline with one another, including copyrighted material by some of\nthe world's leading artists, some of them clients of Ovitz's talent\nmanagement agency, Artists Management Group.\n\n   The involvement of Ovitz in Scour.com would seem to be at cross\npurposes with his role in Artists Management. But his backing of\nScour.com also marks a significant shift in the roiling battle over\ncopyright protection in the digital age.\n\n   Until now, the archnemeses of the recording industry have been\n20-something entrepreneurs creating Web sites that make it easy to\nexchange copyrighted files over the Internet.\n\n   Ovitz's backing for Scour.com's file-exchange mechanism suggests\nthat opposition may be eroding to technology that, by many\naccounts, will force the development of new business models for the\nentertainment industry, changing how artists are compensated for\ntheir work and how their work is protected.\n\n   Ovitz declined to comment. But James Ellis, general counsel for\nArtists Management Group and a director of Scour Inc., said it\nmakes more sense to embrace the technology than to fight it. ``In\nthe face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond,\nto maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted,''\nhe said.\n\n   Ellis said that Scour hoped to find ways to make file sharing\nlucrative for artists. And he said Scour was vigilant about kicking\ncopyright infringers off the site if Scour was informed of the\nproblem.\n\n   Dan Rodrigues, 24, co-founder and president of Scour.com, said\nScour Exchange could not be held accountable if some people used\nthe service to pirate copyrighted material. ``It's impossible for\nus to screen, censor or review,'' he said. ``It's not our job to\nknow what is, or is not, infringing.''\n\n   The Scour.com Web site does include a copyright notice but,\npractically speaking, it is simple to obtain copyrighted material\nby entering the search term for the desired song or movie.\n\n   Some Internet music industry analysts say Ovitz has a\npotentially serious conflict of interest in holding a stake in\nScour.com and managing artists whose music and movies may be traded\nfreely on Scour Exchange. The works of several of the artists\nrepresented by Ovitz's agency are exchanged on Scour Exchange,\nincluding music from the group Blues Traveler and the singer Liz\nPhair.\n\n   ``There is a significant potential for conflict,'' said Kevin\nHause, an Internet music analyst with IDG, a market research group.\n``He is someone entrusted to look out for the best interest of\nartists.''\n\n   But Rodrigues said that Ovitz is actually building a bridge\nbetween the old-world media companies and the new business models\nof the Internet. ``He understands both sides of the equation,''\nRodrigues said. ``He understands what entertainment companies need\nand what's important to copyright holders and what works on the\nWeb.''\n\n   Scour.com was founded in a two-bedroom apartment near the campus\nof the University of California at Los Angeles. Traffic to the site\ngrew quickly, and the company eventually attracted the interest of\nOvitz, who read about Scour.com in the school newspaper, and the\ngrocery billionaire Ron Burkle. For $4 million, the pair took a\nmajority stake in the business, said Rodrigues.\n\n   The company reached deals with a number of Internet start-ups\nand media companies to provide content to include with the search\nfunction. Scour is now contemplating a variety of business models,\nincluding taking advertisements, selling subscriptions and selling\nmultimedia content.\n\n   It now features movie trailers and music promotions provided\nlegitimately by movie and record companies, along with some items\nfor sale, like music available for download. The site now receives\n2 million visitors each month.\n\n   As with Napster, the controversial site offering a service that\nlets users share and trade their music files online, users of Scour\ndownload software over the Internet that allows them to store and\ncatalog multimedia files on their own computers.\n\n   Scour Exchange posts those catalogs and then enables users of\nthe service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and\nshare and download one another's music, movies, and other holdings.\nThe service does not provide the content, but facilitates the\nexchange.\n\n   Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., has been sued by the\nRecording Industry Association of America for reportedly\nfacilitating music piracy in a pending case that many expect to set\na precedent. The association and the five major record labels it\nrepresents say its artists are losing tens of millions of dollars a\nyear because of rampant music piracy on the Internet, a practice\nthat the trade group says threatens to undermine the very economics\nof the creation of music.\n\n   Hilary Rosen, the president of the recording industry\nassociation, said the group was aware of Scour Exchange's\nactivities and was considering its options. But she said the\norganization did not want to rush to file lawsuits against each\nNapster-like service, hoping the decision in that case case might\ndissuade copycats. ``We don't have any interest in litigating our\nway through the Internet,'' she said.\n\n   But in reality the industry association might simply lack the\nresources to file enough lawsuits, given the boom in these services\nand the complexity of the attendant technology. Most recently, a\n23-year-old Irish programmer created Freenet, which would enable\npeople to share files online directly with one another in a way\nthat would make it virtually impossible for copyright holders to\nfind a central database or hub to blame for the interaction.\n\n   Therein lies a key argument of Rodrigues and Scour Exchange.\nThey contend that the free exchange of files online may be\ninevitable, so media companies might as well get on board. ``Were\ntrying to work with entertainment companies to help them use it,''\nRodrigues said, adding, ``Ovitz has been instrumental to us in\nleveraging entertainment relationships he has.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Scour has some agreements with other companies aimed at helping\nusers to download multimedia files in a way that protects\ncopyright. For instance, Liquid Audio, a company that makes\ntechnology to enable digital distribution of music in a way that\nprotects copyright and that is a partner of some of the major\nrecord labels has a deal with Scour to enable it to sell several\nencrypted songs on the site.\n\n   Andrea Cook Fleming, vice president of marketing for Liquid\nAudio, said Liquid Audio is providing an alternative to people who\nmight otherwise pirate music rather than pay for it.\n\n   Another company that has signed a deal with Scour is Nettwerk\nProductions, an independent record label aiming to promote one of\nits up-and-coming artists, a musician named Brian Transeau who\nrecords as BT, on Scour.\n\n   Cathy Barrett, director of strategic marketing for Nettwerk,\nsaid the deal puts the label in an awkward position because the\nsite is promoting the music of BT, but with a single click of the\nmouse, users can get pirated versions of BT's songs free through\nScour.\n\n   But BT said people will inevitably trade copyrighted music on\nthe Web, so artists might as well try to figure out how to\ncapitalize on the sites making that possible. ``It's an\nuncontrollable situation,'' BT said. ``You might as well embrace it\nand make the best of it, or you're going to go insane trying to\nprevent it.''\n\n   Still, some musicians and their agents disagree. Howard King, a\nLos Angeles attorney who is representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in\nlawsuits against Napster, said that Ovitz and Scour have an\nobligation to stand up to piracy. ``Just because some kid in the\nPhilippines knows how to create a devastating virus, doesn't mean\nwe say, `Oh it'll happen again,' and not do something about it,''\nhe said.\n","Headline":"\nAGENT'S ROLE IN MUSIC SITE CHANGES WAR OVER RIGHTS \n","Text":["\n   Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made\nhis name _ and a considerable fortune _ aggressively securing\nhundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for\nartists and studios that he represents.
