The morning Holden boards\nthe Konkar Star, a Panama City newspaper carries a front-page story\nabout a ship that had collided with a canal dredge.\n\n   Some vessels carry nuclear waste in their holds. Others are what\nshippers call ``drugstore tankers,'' vessels packed with liquid\npropane, ammonia and other chemicals. A fully loaded petroleum\ntanker contains more potential energy than the atomic bomb that\ndetonated over Hiroshima in 1945.\n\n   What's more, ships don't have brakes and may require 10 minutes\nto stop by reversing the engines, calling in tugboats or, as a last\nresort, dragging their anchors. On the high seas, captains like to\nstay miles away from other vessels. On the Panama Canal, the leeway\ncan be a few hundred feet.\n\n   ``It's four or five hours of boredom followed by five minutes of\nsheer terror,'' says Holden, who is perched on a red vinyl stool in\nthe Konkar Star's wheelhouse and wearing sunglasses and a black\nbaseball cap.\n\n   Holden always gives passing ships the widest possible berth. He\nlearned that lesson a decade ago when an oncoming vessel carrying\nautomobiles lost power and slammed into Holden's vessel, ripping a\n200-foot hole in the hull.\n\n   Speaking of a passing ship, he says, ``You have to bend to her,\nbecause she's not going to bend to you.''\n\n   From day one, Panama Canal pilots are indoctrinated with safety\nregulations. They train and work for eight years on smaller vessels\nbefore earning ``senior pilot'' status, which allows them to handle\nso-called ``panamax'' ships, such as the Konkar Star. These are the\nlargest ships that can fit through the canal's locks.\n\n   Training includes tests in a multimillion-dollar pilot\nsimulator, which re-creates the conditions inside a ship's\nwheelhouse during a transit. By twisting a few knobs, technicians\ncan add rainstorms, oncoming tankers and a shifting floor. It's so\nrealistic that students in the simulator, which is located near the\ncanal, have become seasick and vomited.\n\n   ``We have all the dynamics of real life,'' says David Constable,\na pilot-training coordinator. ``Over here is the place to make a\nmistake, not in the canal.''\n\n   Delays may be frowned upon, but, in the name of safe passage,\nthey are unavoidable. At the Panama Canal pilots union hall,\nsomeone has posted a sign reminding members: ``Your schedule is\nmore flexible than your ship.''\n\n   In his training manual, Markham, the transit operations\ndirector, warns rookies against getting self-righteous about their\nship's course with this verse by an anonymous scribe:\n\n   ``This is the grave of Mike O'Day,\n\n   Who died maintaining his right of way.\n\n   His right was clear, his will was strong,\n\n   But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong.``\n\n     \n   \nA DANGEROUS JOURNEY   \n  \n\n   Leaving Gatun Lake, the Konkar Star enters a narrow ribbon of\nwater.\n\n   This 8-mile passageway is known as the Gaillard Cut, but those\nwho built it called it Hell's Gorge. Their job amounted to removing\na tropical mountain of rock, shale and mud. It took seven years and\nmillions of pounds of dynamite to complete the task. Avalanches and\naccidental explosions killed hundreds of people.\n\n   ``The flesh of men flew in the air like birds many days,''\naccording to a West Indian laborer quoted by McCullough in ``The\nPath Between the Seas.''\n\n   This is where the sensation of the equatorial wilderness being\nrolled back is the strongest, where the canal resembles an immense,\nman-made culvert.\n\n   Dirt hills rise sharply out of the water and tower over the\nship. Due to landslides and erosion, bulldozers, dredges and\nsappers work continuously to keep the cut more than 50 feet deep,\nwhich allows the passage of the panamax ships. The nearly nonstop\nexcavations have stained the canal's sparkling blue-green water a\nchalky gray.\n\n   The trip through the cut is a squeeze for the Konkar Star, but\nfinessing the vessel into the canal's three sets of locks seems\nalmost impossible. The ship is 106 feet wide; lock chambers are\njust 110 feet wide.\n\n   ``It's like trying to force an olive into a full wine bottle\nwithout spilling,'' Holden says.\n\n   On this transit, the chore of entering the canal's second set of\nlocks will be left to another pilot, because Holden is ready for a\nbreather. It's 1 p.m., and he's been up since 3 a.m., sipping\ncoffee all the while to stay alert. He drinks 12 to 14 cups a day.\n\n   Panamax vessels require two pilots on board during a voyage\nthrough the canal, and Holden is relieved by Jose Lin Young, a\n30-something Panamanian outfitted in pressed Tommy Hilfiger khaki.\nHolden trots down the metal staircase to the officers' mess, which\nis decorated with Greek tourism posters, and digs into a plate of\nspaghetti.\n\n   As Young guides the Konkar Star into the Pedro Miguel locks,\nwhere the ship will begin its descent to sea level, Spiridon, the\nGreek captain, inhales deeply on a Dunhill cigarette and studies\nthe new pilot's every move.\n\n   After a ship moves into a lock, the water beneath the vessel is\nforced out, creating pressures and currents that can push the ship\noff course. Stability is provided by tugboats, which nudge the\nstern of the Konkar Star, and by land-based locomotives with cables\nthat are attached to the port and starboard sides of the ship.\n\n   Asked how close the ship is to the lock wall, Holden, who has\nreturned to the wheelhouse to watch the ship's progress, looks down\nand replies: ``Right now? About 9 inches.``\n\n   But Young makes it in, and the lock gates close behind the ship.\nAs water drains from the chamber, the Konkar Star slowly sinks 31\nfeet. By the time the ship reaches the Pacific, 52 million gallons\nof fresh water will have been flushed from the canal out to sea _\nthe equivalent of a two-day water supply for a large city.\n\n   When the front gate opens, the Konkar Star struggles forward.
