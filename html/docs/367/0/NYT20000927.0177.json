Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ At first glance, the scene at MTV's Times Square\nstudio on a recent Monday afternoon was familiar to anyone who has\never watched even a few minutes of the channel. There were music,\ndancers, DJs, guest appearances and, of course, music videos. But\nthis show, called Direct Effect, may be anything but typical. Its\nproducers say that it offers a glimpse into the near future of\ntelevision for all viewers, even those who can't hold a beat in a\nbasket.\n\n   Direct Effect's primary distinction from regular television fare\nis that it offers viewers to not only watch it on cable television,\nbut to help direct it through computers wired to MTV.com. Well, at\nleast, they can help select _ interacting in real time _ what music\nvideos will be featured on the live hourlong hip-hop music show.\n\n   ``This is perfect for our audience,'' said Sara R. Cohen, vice\npresident of programming for MTV.com. She described MTV's young\ncore audience as being ``convergent people,'' as comfortable with\ntheir computers and cell phones as they are with their televisions.\n\n   Once logged on to MTV.com, viewers can follow a link to Direct\nEffect, where they will find three thumbnail pictures and\ndescriptions of the artists and videos. To vote for the next video\nto be played on Direct Effect, viewers click once on a spot under\nthe description of the video. The vote is sent to the network's\ncontrol room in New York, where it is rapidly tabulated with\nothers. A running tally of the vote is posted on the live\ntelevision screen almost up to the last minute before the next\nvideo is shown.\n\n   ``I think the presence of this sort of show is really\nreassuring,'' said Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of\nSouthern California's School of Cinema and Television and an expert\non hip-hop culture, ``especially when you hear so much about the\n`digital divide' and large numbers of black people and minorities\nbeing left out of the digital revolution.''\n\n   But, he added, when one considers how increasingly comfortable\nyoung people, all kinds of young people, are with cutting edge,\ncomputer-based technologies like computer games and digital music,\n``it's not surprising that we have reached a point where the\nconnection of television and the Internet is so direct.''\n\n   Even without a computer, what viewers see on their television\nscreens is a blend of old-fashioned television dating back to the\ndays of American Bandstand and Soul Train and Web-inspired multiple\nscreens and banner text. In some instances as many as five screens\nmay compete for the viewer's attention at once.\n\n   MTV producers and executives said that they are encouraged by\ntheir own studies of their audience.\n\n   ``Our audience demonstrates that it is very willing to\nparticipate in multi-screen programs here and now,'' said Nicholas\nButterworth, president and chief executive of MTVi, the interactive\narm of MTV Networks.\n\n   As high-speed, broadband Internet service is slowly\nproliferating the United States, television and Internet executives\nare increasingly promising that PC-smart, set-top boxes will one\nday soon start transforming television, making much of it\ninteractive. Brian Graden, president of programming for MTV, said\nhis viewers were not willing to wait.\n\n   ``Our audience is probably not like any other,'' added Brian\nGraden, president of programming for MTV. ``About 70 percent of\nthem have computers and TV in the same room and use them at the\nsame time. They have come up with a crude two-box solution to\ninteractivity.''\n\n   The MTV Networks/Viacom Study of Media, Entertainment and\nLeisure Time found last summer that there has been a significant\nswell in the numbers of people owning and using personal computers\nin their homes.
