He said passengers are required\nto walk a gangplank from the cruise ship to a smaller vessel,\ncalled a tender, that can dock.\n\n   The lawsuit said that on Jan. 2, 1999, ``while (Perlmutter) was\nattempting to get from the ship to the tender, (Perlmutter) fell\ninto the water up to his armpits and sustained serious and\npermanent injuries to his body.''\n\n   Branch said Perlmutter did not require immediate medical\nattention, but he will likely need surgery on his right knee\nbecause of damage caused by the fall. He said Perlmutter will seek\nless than $75,000 but declined to say exactly how much.\n\n   The attorney said the waters were choppy at the time because of\nan approaching front, and the smaller vessel was moving around\nbecause it was not properly anchored. He said Perlmutter did not\nfall off the side of the the gangplank, which was about 8 feet wide\nand 15 feet long with no handrails. The accident occurred as\nPerlmutter stepped off the gangplank to get on the tender.\n\n   ``He (Perlmutter) went to step on the tender, and all of a\nsudden there was no tender,'' Branch said, explaining the smaller\nship was moved by the rough seas.\n\n   Branch said the cruise line should have had employees assist\nPerlmutter off the gangplank in the choppy waters, and it should\nhave made sure the smaller ship was stable.\n\n   Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Lynn Martenstein said it is the\ncompany's understanding that Perlmutter sustained minor injuries.\nShe declined to comment further on the lawsuit because of the\npending litigation.\n\n   She said gangplanks are safe and are commonly used to get\npassengers to ports where large cruise ships cannot dock.\n\n   ``I don't know of any other incidents when this has happened,''\nMartenstein said. ``It's a routine procedure, and we have staff\nassisting people.''\n\n   Branch said he would not equate the dangers of walking the\ngangplank with ``walking the plank'' on pirate ships.\n\n   ``But if it conjures up piracy, that's fine,'' he said.\n\n     \nXXXX END OF STORY  \n","Headline":"\nTEXAS MAN SUES CRUISE LINE OVER FALL \n\n","Text":["\n   HOUSTON _ A Houston man has sued Miami-based Royal Caribbean\ncruise line over an unexpected splash he received during a Hawaiian\nvacation earlier this year.\n","\n   Bernard Perlmutter, 79, says in the state district lawsuit he\nfiled Monday that while on the trip, he discovered that he and\nother passengers would have to ``negotiate a wooden gangplank'' to\nenjoy the beauty of the Hawaiian islands.\n","\n   Victor Branch, Perlmutter's attorney, said the cruise ship\nLegend of the Seas is too large to dock at the port of Lahaina,\nMaui, where the incident happened.
