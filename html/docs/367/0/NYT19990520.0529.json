Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ By a vote of 73-25, the Senate Thursday night\npassed a broad juvenile crime bill that contained an array of new\ngun-control measures, the fruit of the most significant debate over\ngun control in Congress in half a decade.\n\n   Those measures ranged from a requirement that licensed dealers\nsell child safety devices with every handgun to mandatory\nbackground checks on all people who buy firearms at gun shows. The\namendments to the juvenile crime bill also restricted the access\nthat children under 18 have to semi-automatic assault weapons and\nbanned the import of high-capacity ammunition clips.\n\n   But more significant than any of these measures was the fact\nthat they came up for consideration _ and, in some cases, drew\nbipartisan support _ at all. That fact reflected an undeniable\nshift in the political climate.\n\n   Although surprising momentum has grown in the Senate in recent\nweeks for gun control measures, they are still relatively modest\nand fall short of proposals for more stringent regulation. Yet the\nprogress represents the biggest victory for the gun control\nadvocates in five years, and they come as a new political center is\ndeveloping on guns and violence.\n\n   Democrats, who had once chalked up the loss of their majority in\nCongress in 1994 to their advocacy for gun control, suddenly sensed\nthat the issue had turned in their favor and pressed forward with\ngun-control proposals. Many Republicans acquiesced, more skittish\nabout seeming soft on gun control than alienating the gun lobby or\ntheir most conservative, rural constituents.\n\n   But the most charged moment of the day came hours before the\nbill's passage, when Vice President Al Gore made a rare Senate\nappearance and cast a tie-breaking vote that enabled a Democratic\ngun-control amendment to prevail over a less stringent Republican\nversion.\n\n   The 51-50 vote on the amendment, which would require background\nchecks with the sale of firearms at gun shows, reversed the outcome\nof a similar vote last week and was easily the most stunning of a\nstring of Democratic victories on gun control in the Senate over\nthe last eight days.\n\n   It also provided Gore, whose campaign for the Democratic\npresidential nomination has yet to catch fire, with a heady\ntriumph. Democrats believe that American sentiment about firearms\nhas turned toward their party's advocacy of tighter restrictions,\nand Gore got to carry that banner by playing the knight who arrived\nin the nick of time to save a teetering cause.\n\n   Gore voted less than four hours after bullets ripped through yet\nanother high school, in Conyers, Ga. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said\nthe shooting was a factor in his decision to switch his vote in\nfavor of his party's measure.\n\n   President Clinton, for his part, was visiting Littleton, Colo.,\nwhere the shooting deaths of 15 people at a high school last month\naltered the political climate enough to make Thursday's events in\nthe Senate possible. The legislation faces uncertain odds in the\nHouse, where there have been conflicting signals about lawmakers'\nreceptiveness to gun control.\n\n   ``This is a turning point for our country,'' said Gore, a\nradiant smile glued to his face, at a news conference after he left\nthe Senate floor.\n\n   More somberly, Gore added, ``Now I personally would like to\ndedicate my tie-breaking vote to all of the families that have\nsuffered from gun violence.''\n\n   Eight hours later, after debates and votes on less heavily\nfreighted amendments, the Senate passed the juvenile crime bill,\n73-25. The core of the bill, which became a vehicle for several\ngun-control amendments and the most significant gun-control debate\nin Congress in half a decade, calls for $1 billion in federal\ngrants to toughen prosecution of juvenile crime and enhance efforts\nto prevent it.\n\n   A similar bill before the House Judiciary Committee does not\nhave gun-control measures in it. But the committee's chairman, Rep.\nHenry Hyde, R-Ill., announced Thursday that such amendments would\nbe considered when the committee met to reshape the bill in two\nweeks.\n\n   It was only the fourth time in Gore's vice presidency that he\nbroke a tie in the Senate, over which the vce president technically\npresides.\n\n   As votes on the last of several gun-control amendments trickled\nin around midday, Gore took a seat at the head of the chamber. When\nit became clear that a tie was likely, Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\nD-Calif., giggled and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the vice\npresident. Other Senate Democrats rushed over to shake his hand.\n\n   Although Republicans have a 55-to-45 advantage in the Senate,\nsix Republicans who have repeatedly broken party ranks on gun\ncontrol sided with Democrats Thursday, while only one Democrat, Max\nBaucus of Montana, sided with Republicans. That created the tie.\n\n   On the final bill, 31 Republicans and 42 Democrats voted in\nfavor of passage, while 23 Republicans and two Democrats voted\nagainst.\n\n   Those Republicans who opposed it did so largely on ground that\nDemocrats had succeeded in amending the bill to include both new\ngun-control measures and a greater emphasis on prevention.\n\n   A few hours after the Senate voted on the gun show amendment,\nSen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, called a news conference to\nraise a different issue: the leaking of nuclear secrets during the\nClinton administration to the Chinese.\n\n   Asked about the success of the Democratic gun-show amendment,\nwhich he opposed, Lott said that the Democrats' campaign for gun\ncontrol was largely political preening.\n\n   ``Guns don't cause people to do these things,'' Lott said.\n``Something in their beings is doing it. When do we put the\nresponsibility on the individuals?''\n\n   But Clinton, in a statement released in Littleton, said, ``I\napplaud the Senate for today's historic vote.''\n\n   And a White House official described the Lott news conference as\nan attempt to divert attention away from his party's gun-control\n``debacle.''\n\n   The Democratic gun-show amendment, which would mandate\nbackground checks on all people buying weapons at these shows,\njoined a series of a half dozen gun-control measures that have\npassed as amendments to the juvenile crime bill. Many of the\nmeasures garnered broad Republican support, an unmistakable sign of\nchanged times.\n\n   The vote on the Democratic gun-show amendment was the last\nstrange twist in a bizarre chain of gun-show votes that had\nRepublicans switching their course or tweaking their position from\none day to the next.\n\n   When the Democratic gun-show amendment first came up for a vote\na week ago, Senate Republicans defeated it, 51-47, in a largely\nparty-line vote. Instead, they approved a rival Republican\namendment that called for voluntary background checks at gun shows.\n\n   Two days later, Senate Republicans rethought their position and\npassed a new gun-show amendment that they said made background\nchecks mandatory.\n\n   But Democrats noted that the combined Republican amendments\nactually relaxed existing gun-control regulations in other areas.\nSo the Republicans came back with a third amendment, intended to\naddress concerns about the first two.\n\n   That amendment passed Thursday. But only minutes later, the\noriginal Democratic amendment, modified slightly and reintroduced,\nsupplanted it.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The new outcome was explained in part by the presence of two\nDemocrats _ Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Daniel\nInouye of Hawaii _ who had been absent last week but voted in favor\nof the amendment Thursday.\n\n   Just as critically, Sen. Cleland of Georgia, one of only two\nDemocrats who had opposed the measure last week, changed his vote\nThursday.\n\n   Cleland said that, because of subtle revisions to the original\nDemocratic amendment, he had almost firmly decided to switch his\nvote on Wednesday.\n\n   But he said that awaking Thursday morning to news of the\nshooting in his home state erased any tiny, lingering doubts.\n\n   ``For that to occur in my own state, in my own back yard,\nreinforced and steeled my commitment,'' Cleland said. ``It pushed\nme over the edge.''\n\n   The only Democrat to vote against his party Thursday was Max\nBaucus of Montana, whose position suggested the degree to which\ngeography trumps party affiliation on gun-control issues.\n\n   Four of the six Republicans who joined Democrats last week and\nagain Thursday were from the Midwest, where support for easy access\nto firearms is not as fierce as in the South and West.\n\n   They were Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Peter Fitzgerald of\nIllinois, Richard Lugar of Indiana and George Voinovich of Ohio.\nSens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator John Warner of\nVirginia also voted for the Democratic amendment.\n\n   These senators said they had problems with several aspects of\nthe Republican gun-show measures that even a third amendment did\nnot fix. The measures, for example, would have made it less\ncumbersome for licensed gun dealers to sell weapons in other\nstates.\n\n   The measures also would have shortened from three business days\nto 24 hours the amount of time given to vendors at gun shows to\nconduct background checks.\n\n   ``That was a big loophole,'' DeWine said.\n\n   The National Rifle Association had lobbied against the\nDemocratic gun-show amendment and, after the vote, said that the\nSenate had not addressed a larger problem: lax enforcement of\nexisting gun laws.\n\n   Democrats said that the association's influence was clearly\nwaning.\n\n   ``What we have seen today now is, for the first time in a major\nkind of gun-control issue, rejection of the National Rifle\nAssociation and a vote for common sense,'' said Sen.
