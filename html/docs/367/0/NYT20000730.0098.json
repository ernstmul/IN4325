Times News Service   \n\n   During the age of the sailing ship, Spain built a global empire\nstretching from Havana to Potosi in the Andes to Manila _ the first\nempire on which the sun never set. But it paid dearly for its\nachievement. Thousands of Spanish ships went down over the\ncenturies, many heavy with gold and silver, emeralds and diamonds,\nporcelains and fine steels.\n\n   In modern times, Spain has taken little action as treasure\nhunters and marine archaeologists raised its sunken riches. It\nwatched as Mel Fisher found the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a galleon\nthat sank off the Florida Keys in 1622. He eventually hauled up\nabout $400 million in treasure, and gave Queen Sofia of Spain one\nof the ship's cannons.\n\n   Now, for the first time, Spain is laying claim to its lost\nships, and it has won a legal battle over the issue.\n\n   On July 21, a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that Spain\nowned the remains of two warships lost off the Virginia coast two\ncenturies ago. The ruling snatched the ships away from Ben Benson,\na treasure hunter who had estimated that the shipwrecks bear more\nthan a half-billion dollars in lost coins and precious metals.\n\n   The shift in Spain's stance, experts said, could mark an end to\nthe glory days of treasure hunting and the beginning of a time when\nSpain oversees the recovery of its lost fleets in pursuit not only\nof doubloons but of cultural riches, historical insights and new\nrespect for Spanish graves.\n\n   But Benson, president of Sea Hunt, a salvage company named after\nan old television show, may fight the ruling. Having spent nearly\n$2 million on preliminary recovery work and legal fees, he is\nsailing to the Bahamas, he said in an interview last week, to\nmeditate on whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.\n\n   ``I was shocked,'' Benson said of the ruling. ``There's no case\nlaw to support their conclusion. It's uncharted waters for the\nshipwreck industry as a whole.''\n\n   James A. Goold of Covington & Burling in Washington, who led\nSpain's legal fight, said the victory was sound and long in\ndeveloping. ``I'm sure a lot of treasure hunters view this decision\nwith alarm,'' he said, ``but they should have known it was\ncoming.''\n\n   Spain said the victory marked the start of an aggressive effort\non its part to look after its old interests and, probably, to team\nup for recovery work with coastal nations whose waters harbor its\nsunken ships.\n\n   ``It's a turning point,'' said Rafael Rodriguez Ponga, director\nof cultural affairs in the Foreign Ministry in Madrid. ``It's a\nvery important step in the recognition of the rights of Spain all\nover the world.''\n\n   He added that he hoped Spain's recovery of vanished ships and\nartifacts, and their display in public museums and analysis by\nscholars, would illuminate and deepen public appreciation of\nSpain's past.\n\n   David Beltran, legal adviser to the Spanish Embassy in\nWashington, said the victory in Virginia would have major\nrepercussions. ``We need to fix the rules about shipwrecks all\naround the world,'' he said. ``This ruling sets a strong\nprecedent.''\n\n   Over the ages, Spain lost whole armadas of tall ships to gales,\nmishaps and piracy because it started its conquests so early and\nacquired so many distant lands, especially in the Americas and the\nPhilippines. Near the peak of its influence, from 1580 to 1640, it\nalso ruled Portugal and that country's colonial possessions in\nAfrica and Asia.\n\n   The recent battle over the lost ships _ La Galga (the name is\nSpanish for ``the greyhound''), which went down in 1750, and Juno,\nwhich sank in 1802 _ was joined not only by Spain but also by\nBritain and the United States, which sided with Spain.\n\n   Legal experts said those nations, and others with long maritime\ntraditions, are increasingly eager to assert ownership of their old\nshipwrecks now that technology is fast opening the seas to\nexploration and recovery.\n\n   In backing Spain, the Justice Department argued that the United\nStates owned thousands of lost vessels and sought to ensure that\nthey were ``treated as sovereign ships and honored graves and are\nnot subject to exploration, or exploitation.''\n\n   The appellate court, in its ruling, noted the government's\nstance favorably. The courts, it added, ``cannot just turn over''\nsovereign wrecks to commercial salvors when all the nations\ninvolved agree that ``title to the shipwreck remains with the\noriginal owner.''\n\n   Legal scholars said the strong opinion was likely to affect\nshipwreck claims in many territorial seas and by nations other than\nSpain. It might, they added, strengthen state claims to high-seas\nwrecks. Previously, the traditional rule was ``finders keepers,''\nas when French and American salvors laid claim to the Titanic, the\nsunken British luxury liner.\n\n   Based in Norfolk, Va., the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals covers\nMaryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina. Its opinion\nweighs heavily in shipwreck law because hundreds of lost hulks lie\nin coastal waters off those states. The area off Cape Hatteras,\nN.C., is known as the graveyard of the Atlantic, so numerous are\nits shipwrecks.\n\n   Spanish officials estimate that Spain lost 600 ships in American\nwaters alone.\n\n   In the Sea Hunt case, which involved dozens of lawyers, the\nstate of Virginia sided with Sea Hunt, citing a 1987 federal law\ngiving states jurisdiction over abandoned ships in coastal waters.\nSignificantly, Benson had agreed to give Virginia some of the\nrecovered loot and 25 percent of any profits from treasure that he\nsold.\n\n   Barry L. Clifford of Provincetown, Mass., who found a famous\npirate ship off Cape Cod and helped Benson hunt for Spanish wrecks,\ndeplored the appellate court's ruling and Spain's ownership claims.\n\n   ``Every ounce of that silver and gold was stolen,'' he said,\nreferring to theft from the indigenous peoples of Central and South\nAmerica. He added that the people were ``forced into slavery'' to\nmine the precious metals.\n\n   If Spain recovers its lost booty, Clifford added, it will raise\nquestions of whether it should pay compensation, just as Germany\nhas agreed to make financial amends to victims of the Nazis.\n\n   Spain, playing down the treasure issue, portrayed the two lost\nships in the case as military grave sites and avoided any hint that\nit was interested in lost gold, contending that Juno and La Galga\nat the time of their sinking carried no riches of any significance.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The case began in 1996, when Benson won Virginia permits to\nexplore coastal waters off Assateague Island. He soon said he had\nfound the remains of Juno, a 34-gun frigate whose sinking took more\nthan 400 lives, and of La Galga, a 50-gun frigate, most of whose\ncrew and passengers are said to have reached land safely.\n\n   But in 1998, Spain sued for ownership and possession, contending\nthat it had never abandoned the ships, the issue at the heart of\nthe case under common law. In 1999, a federal district judge, J.\nCalvitt Clarke Jr., awarded La Galga to Virginia and Juno to Spain.\nHe cited distinctions in international treaties of 1763 and 1819 as\nlegal rationales.\n\n   But writing for the appellate court, Chief Judge J. Harvie\nWilkinson III gave both ships to Spain, arguing that any\nabandonment of sovereign shipwrecks had to be explicit, not\nimplied.\n\n   David J. Bederman, an Emory University law professor who helped\nrepresent Sea Hunt, said the court's opinion would be influential\nbut disputatious. ``We're going to get into historical arguments\nover what is sovereign and private,'' he said in an interview,\nadding that ``the meaning of that has changed over 500 years,''\nwith private ships more common in modern times.\n\n   Rodriguez Ponga of the Foreign Ministry disagreed and said\nownership in those days was usually unambiguous, with the crown\noften in charge. Spain, he said, had very good shipping records,\nand ownership issues would be settled case by case.\n\n   ``It doesn't matter for us if there is treasure or money,'' he\nadded. ``It's a question of sovereignty.''\n","Headline":"\nSPAIN FIGHTS FOR RIGHTS TO TREASURE-LADEN SHIPWRECKS \n","Text":["\n   During the age of the sailing ship, Spain built a global empire\nstretching from Havana to Potosi in the Andes to Manila _ the first\nempire on which the sun never set.
