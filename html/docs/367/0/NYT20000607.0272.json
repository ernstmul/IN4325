Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ If copyright laws are not more broadly and\naggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be\nforced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that\nconsumers will not like, an industry leader warned Wednesday.\n\n   ``You're going to have a piece of music that will only play on\none Walkman,'' John E. Warnock, the chairman and chief executive of\nAdobe Systems, said during a panel discussion on Capitol Hill\ninvolving 10 key software executives. ``You're going to have a\npiece of software that will only work on one machine. It will\nprovide enormous inconvenience.''\n\n   The industry officials were in Washington as part of an annual\nlobbying trip organized by the Business Software Alliance. They\nsaid they were not asking for new copyright laws, just better\nprosecution of the fast-growing number of digital piracy cases.\n\n   ``We need more cases brought to the court system,'' said Carol\nBartz, chairwoman and chief executive of Autodesk Inc.\n\n   Warnock also urged the government to educate young people who\nthink that piracy and breaking into computers are no big deal.\n\n   ``We would like government to set an example, to send a message\nthat this is breaking the law and the law will be enforced,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   In a survey released by the alliance in conjunction with the\nvisit, software executives estimated that by 2005, 66 percent of\nsoftware will be distributed over the Internet, compared with 12\npercent today.\n\n   ``The increase in Internet distribution and the growing number\nof users raises the possibility of even greater losses due to\npiracy in the coming years,'' said the survey, which cited an\nestimate that 36 percent of all software in use last year was\npirated.\n\n   Bartz urged Congress to encourage more copyright enforcement\nefforts by federal authorities.\n\n   In addition to meeting with administration officials and\ncongressional leaders over the last two days, the executives sent\nletters to the major presidential candidates asking for their\ndedication to three top policy goals outlined in the survey.\n\n   In addition to broader copyright enforcement, the executives are\nurging continued adoption of free-trade policies. The House\nrecently voted to establish free trade with China and a vote is\npending in the Senate.\n\n   The executives are also pushing for more visas for skilled\nforeign workers, saying that without more visas, 9 percent of\nAmerica's high-skilled, high-wage jobs will go unfilled.\n\n   ``How you respond to these issues will have a vital impact on\nthe next phase of the Internet economy, with tremendous\nconsequences for American jobs, standard of living and\ncompetitiveness,'' the executives wrote in the letters to the\ncandidates. ``We ask for your full support and your commitment to\nmake these an integral part of your policy agenda.''\n\n   Other software executives in Washington on Wednesday were Andrew\nS. Grove of Intel, Eric E. Schmidt of Novell and Stephen M. Bennett\nof Intuit. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, was in town on\nTuesday for meetings and a congressional hearing, but returned to\nSeattle on Tuesday night.\n","Headline":"\nSOFTWARE EXECUTIVES CALL FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT LAWS \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ If copyright laws are not more broadly and\naggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be\nforced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that\nconsumers will not like, an industry leader warned Wednesday.\n","\n   ``You're going to have a piece of music that will only play on\none Walkman,'' John E.
