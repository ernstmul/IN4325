(js) \n By LARRY ROHTER   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   MIAMI _ A cruise ship with more than 3,495 people on board\ncaught fire shortly after leaving the port of Miami Monday\nafternoon, generating huge clouds of dark smoke before U.S. Coast\nGuard vessels came to the rescue and doused the flames.\n\n   No injuries were reported on board the Carnival Cruise line\nvessel Ecstasy, which was scheduled to sail first to Key West, Fla.\nand then to Cozumel, Mexico, on a four-day trip. The giant ship,\n855-feet long and with nine passenger decks, halted less than two\nmiles off Miami Beach, where it remained until Coast Guard tugboats\ntowed it back to port this evening.\n\n   ``There are no plans to evacuate anyone,'' said Jeff Murphy, a\nspokesman for the Coast Guard.\n\n   Local television stations spoke by cellular telephone with\nseveral people on board, who reported that after some initial\nalarm, passengers put on life jackets and lined up in an orderly\nfashion on upper decks at the front of the vessel. As one passenger\nspoke to reporters, a voice over a loudspeaker could be heard\nwarning that ``no one is allowed to leave the lounge.''\n\n   Passengers said that the aft area of the vessel caught fire\nalmost as soon as the ship, which is registered in Liberia, left\nport. The affected area, several decks high and about four porthole\nwindows deep, was said to house the ship's main laundry room and to\nbe full of towels and flammable cleaning substances.\n\n   The blaze was visible both from buildings in downtown Miami and\nfrom the beach, drawing curious onlookers to the balconies of\napartment buildings and out of chic South Beach restaurants onto\nthe sand. Powerful jets of water could be seen pouring from the\nhalf-dozen or so tugboats that were sent to put out the blaze and\nremained on the scene for more than two hours.\n\n   Members of the vessel's crew of more than 900 initially\nattempted to douse the fire, but were driven back by the intensity\nof the flames. According to local news reports, they closed thick\nfiredoors as they withdrew, an action that prevented the fire from\nspreading to the heart of the ship.\n\n   The fire aboard the Ecstasy is not the first one. On July 25,\n1995, the Ecstasy had an electrical fire while sailing home to\nMiami. One of its two engines was shut down, but there were no\ninjuries.\n\n   Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines, said\npassengers could stay on board until they made other travel\narrangements, but those who wanted to leave would be helped with\nhotel and air plans, according to The Associated Press.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Dickinson said the cost of the cruise would be refunded and\npassengers could take a free cruise in the future.\n\n   Because the Ecstasy was within two miles of shore, it was still\nunder the jurisdiction of the captain of the port, who ordered the\nship to anchorage, said Lt. Cmdr. Pat Philbin, at Coast Guard\nheadquarters in Washington.\n\n   The Coast Guard inspects cruise ships like the Ecstasy every six\nmonths or so, Philbin said. ``During the course of those\ninspections, we actually require them to go through fire drills and\nboat-lowering drills,'' he said. ``We also check for structural\nintegrity, to make sure in the event that they have a fire, they're\nable to contain it.''\n\n   Standard procedure, he said, is to seal off the area with a fire\nto stop it from spreading, and then figure out how to fight it.\n\n   Philbin said, ``The thing that sailors fear most at sea is a\nfire, because there's just no where to go.'' Engine rooms, galleys\nand ``anywhere where there is a source of heat'' are vulnerable to\nfires, he said.\n","Headline":"\nCRUISE SHIP CATCHES FIRE OFF FLORIDA COAST \n","Text":["\n   MIAMI _ A cruise ship with more than 3,495 people on board\ncaught fire shortly after leaving the port of Miami Monday\nafternoon, generating huge clouds of dark smoke before U.S. Coast\nGuard vessels came to the rescue and doused the flames.\n","\n   No injuries were reported on board the Carnival Cruise line\nvessel Ecstasy, which was scheduled to sail first to Key West, Fla.\nand then to Cozumel, Mexico, on a four-day trip.
