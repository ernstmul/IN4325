OESTREICH   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   When the New York Philharmonic released ``The Historic\nBroadcasts, 1923-87,'' a remarkable archival set of 10 CDs, a year\nago, an obvious question arose: Among the 26 composers represented,\nwhy no Mahler? The Mahler tradition of the orchestra is, after all,\nuniquely rich. Like those of the Vienna Philharmonic and the Royal\nConcertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, it was set in motion by\nGustav Mahler himself as conductor, but unlike those others, it was\nnot short-circuited in the 1930s and 40s by the anti-Semitic\nfallout from Nazi annexation or occupation.\n\n   The Philharmonic, the answer came back, was holding the big gun\nin reserve, hoping to follow with a set consisting entirely of\nMahler's music. Now that release has impressively materialized on\n12 CDs as ``The Mahler Broadcasts, 1948-82'' (NYP 9801/12), and the\nobvious question becomes: Among the 10 conductors represented, why\nno Bernstein? Leonard Bernstein, after all, though he did not\nsingle-handedly revive the Philharmonic's Mahler tradition, as is\noften supposed, certainly took it to its loftiest heights in a\nseries of performances throughout his tenure as music director,\nfrom 1958 to 1969, and beyond.\n\n   Again, the Philharmonic is quick to reply. Bernstein's omission,\nit turns out, is not for lack of trying. Sedgwick Clark, the set's\nproducer, explains in booklet notes that of all the Mahler works\nthe maestro performed with the Philharmonic, all but two are\nrepresented among Bernstein's commercial recordings with the\norchestra, which remain in more or less continual circulation.\n\n   One of those absentees, the Eighth Symphony, was not broadcast,\nand the orchestra's hopes to release the other, ``Das Lied von der\nErde,'' from 1967, foundered, Clark writes, when it was discovered\nthat ``rights for the release of Bernstein's Mahler broadcasts are\nnot available at this time.''\n\n   As it is, the set's conductors are all Mahlerians of substantial\nachievement, including notable like John Barbirolli, Dimitri\nMitropoulos, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Klaus Tennstedt and\nBruno Walter. And some of the performances are certified classics,\nof particular value for the light they shed on that murky\npre-Bernstein era of Mahler performance at the Philharmonic, even\nif that light is not entirely new.\n\n   It is good, for example, to have authorized and excellently\nrestored issues of Mitropoulos's Sixth Symphony, of 1955, and\nStokowski's Eighth, of 1950, which were previously represented only\nby unauthorized or ancient releases of almost identical vintage.\n\n   And the ``Lied von der Erde'' finally included, conducted by\nWalter in 1948, differs most tellingly from his other indispensable\nPhilharmonic recordings of the work by including the great English\nMahler contralto Kathleen Ferrier, as she made her American debut,\nat 35.\n\n   Other landmarks in the orchestra's Mahler history are\nrepresented as well. From its first Mahler festival at Carnegie\nHall, in 1959 and 1960, which commemorated the composer's\ncentenary, comes the Andante of the unfinished 10th Symphony,\nconducted by Mitropoulos; from its second such festival, in 1976,\ncomes a Third Symphony conducted by Pierre Boulez, with Yvonne\nMinton as the mezzo-soprano.\n\n   Zubin Mehta's performance of the ``Resurrection'' Symphony, with\nKathleen Battle and Maureen Forrester as soloists, celebrated the\norchestra's 10,000th concert, in 1982.\n\n   What's more, the set offers a wealth of valuable information,\nboth on disk and in print. William Malloch's two-hour collection of\ninterviews ``I Remember Mahler,'' originally produced in 1964 for\nKPFK radio in Los Angeles, is presented complete, alongside spoken\nrecollections by Walter, Stokowski and Barbirolli.\n\n   Two lavish booklets offer program notes, artist biographies, a\nguide to the shifting orchestral roster, lists of Mahler's own\nperformances with the orchestra and of the orchestra's Mahler\nrecordings, and groups of essays on Mahler's work as conductor and\ncomposer and on the orchestra's relation to both.\n\n   Most fascinating perhaps is the complete list of Mahler\nperformances by the orchestra (as Philharmonic or New York Symphony\nSociety, with which it merged in 1928). They range from the\nSymphony Society's American premiere of the Fourth Symphony,\nconducted by Walter Damrosch in 1904, to the First Symphony\nconducted last July by Kurt Masur.\n\n   Mahler himself led the American premieres of his\n``Resurrection'' Symphony in 1908 with the Symphony Society and of\nthe First Symphony in 1909 with the Philharmonic, among other\nperformances. Bernstein took up the cause in 1959 with the funereal\nthird movement of the First Symphony in a televised Young People's\nConcert, and he gave his last Mahler performances with the\norchestra in the ``Resurrection'' Symphony in 1989.\n\n   In all, this set may well be a model of its kind. But in the\nwake of all the Bernstein explanations, the question remains, Just\nwhat kind is that? Without Bernstein, the collection cannot\nremotely be said to represent the Philharmonic's Mahler tradition\nin full or even at its best. It can only vaguely be called\nhistoric, on the strength of those few older recordings. There was\nevidently not a great deal of pre-Bernstein material from which to\nchoose.\n\n   (According to the performance list, radio broadcasts of Mahler's\nmusic began in 1925, with the second movement of the\n``Resurrection'' Symphony conducted at a students' concert by\nWillem Mengelberg, but the earliest surviving copy is from 1941, a\nFirst Symphony led by Mitropoulos. In addition to that Mitropoulos\nFirst and the early material in the set, there exist 12 other\ncopies of pre-Bernstein performances, of whatever quality,\nconducted by Walter, Mitropoulos, Artur Rodzinski and Efrem Kurtz.)\n\n   What the set amounts to is a collection of good, in some cases\nexcellent, performances, which are mostly not otherwise available,\nat least in reproductions of such high quality. That is no small\nthing, and in truth the set does not pretend to be more. Both\nMahler specialists and inveterate fans of the Philharmonic can only\nbe grateful.\n\n   nn\n\n   But the casual listener would do well to consider the package in\na broader context. (It is available only from the New York\nPhilharmonic at 800-557-8268 or on line at\nwww.newyorkphilharmonic.org, for $225 plus handling and shipping,\nand at Tower Records stores.)\n\n   For this motley armada, with elements both antique and modern,\nsets out in perilous waters, crowded with well-organized fleets and\nsleek vessels. At a time when classical-recording companies have\nlargely given up on new projects and fallen back on reissues of\nvenerable recordings, American orchestras have tried to make up\ntheir losses by mining their archives to claim a share of the\n``historical'' market.\n\n   And they have had some success, as the Philharmonic did with its\nwildly mixed package last year. But in the case of Mahler, the\nmajor labels offer strenuous competition, with a steady diet of\nreissues as well as occasional new recordings.\n\n   Among the conductors in the Philharmonic package, two were\nrecently featured in major Mahler reissues. Walter's classic 1954\nColumbia recording of the First Symphony with the Philharmonic was\njust released in Sony Classical's Masterworks Heritage series (MHK\n63328; CD). And EMI has repackaged Tennstedt's complete survey of\nthe symphonies and ``Das Lied von der Erde'' with the London\nPhilharmonic in a box commemorating the conductor's death this year\n(EMI Classics 5 72799 2; 12 CDs).\n\n   When it comes to Bernstein, the commercial labels have the\ngoods. Deutsche Grammophon has just reissued Bernstein's\nmagisterial late survey of the symphonies and other works with the\nVienna Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the New\nYork Philharmonic in a digitally remastered edition (459 080-2; 16\nCDs).\n\n   Sony, meanwhile, is embarked on its latest reissue of\nBernstein's 1960s Columbia cycle of the symphonies, mostly with the\nNew York Philharmonic, in its Bernstein Century series.\n\n   Just the other day, in fact, Bernstein's 1966 recording of the\nFirst Symphony arrived (Sony Classical SMK 60732; CD), and a\nlistener who was long ago weaned on this version of the work, as on\nother Mahler recordings by Bernstein and the Philharmonic, returned\nto it for the first time in many years.\n\n   The experience was utterly refreshing, revealing a remarkably\ndetailed approach to rhythm and articulation and a mercurial relish\nfor contrasts, all of which had been eroded in the memory by\ndecades of routine performances of the work in lesser hands and by\nBernstein's own later tendency toward grand visions. Now as then,\nthose lively qualities contrast fascinatingly with the ineffable\nwarmth and mystery of that Walter First, another early favorite\ngiven new life.\n\n   But between those two benchmarks in the Philharmonic\ndiscography, the orchestra's new set inserts a relatively bland\nversion of the First Symphony, conducted by Barbirolli in 1959,\nshortly before Bernstein's televised analysis of the work's third\nmovement.\n\n   The Barbirolli account is by no means bad, despite a sluggish\ntempo in the scherzo and some tenuous intonation in the funeral\nmarch. (Through glasses of a different color, Clark, the producer,\nsees ``rustic weight'' in the scherzo and ``deliciously seedy\ntone'' in the march.) Yet even without relentless coughing from an\naudience ridden with flu or boredom, this version would pale\nbetween its inspired neighbors.\n\n   Not every case is so clear-cut. Barbirolli's version of the\nNinth Symphony, from 1962, is better than his First, admirable\nespecially in the intensity of the finale, if still no match for\nthe eloquent Ninths of Bernstein and Herbert von Karajan with the\nBerlin Philharmonic, both on Deutsche Grammophon.\n\n   And some comparisons fall in favor of the Philharmonic set. The\nTennstedt recording of the Fifth Symphony, from 1980, carrying the\nexcitement of live performance in full measure, surpasses the 1978\naccount in the Tennstedt EMI set, though it is similarly marred by\na maddening inconsistency of focus from this intermittently\nbrilliant interpreter.\n\n   The remaining items in the Philharmonic set are a surprisingly\ngenial Fourth Symphony from Solti in 1962, with Irmgard Seefried as\nsoprano soloist; a vibrant Seventh from Rafael Kubelik in 1981; the\n``Purgatorio'' from the 10th Symphony, led by Mitropoulos in 1958,\nand the ``Songs of a Wayfarer,'' conducted by William Steinberg and\ninimitably sung by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in 1964.\n\n   This is all worthwhile material that will thrill any serious\nMahlerian, as on many levels it did this one. But it should not be\nanyone's only experience of these works. A Bernstein set, either\nDeutsche Grammophon's or Sony's, would be the perfect complement.\nBut if, on the level of these hefty investments, it must be one or\nthe other, it should probably be Bernstein, with hope kept alive to\nadd the Philharmonic set later.\n\n   Meanwhile, it should be fascinating to see what the\nPhilharmonic, with this inevitable mission satisfactorily if not\nideally accomplished, and with lessons learned in dealing with\nrecalcitrant record companies and estates of dead maestros, dreams\nup next.\n","Headline":"\nA RICH MAHLER TRADITION IN A PHILHARMONIC SET  \n (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 20) \n","Text":["\n   When the New York Philharmonic released ``The Historic\nBroadcasts, 1923-87,'' a remarkable archival set of 10 CDs, a year\nago, an obvious question arose: Among the 26 composers represented,\nwhy no Mahler?
