Times News Service   \n\n   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The good life is gobbling up the old life in\nevery direction around here. Where not too long ago there was\nprairie and small-town America in the shadow of the foothills, now\nthere are new and expensive houses, lush golf courses, shopping\nmalls, multiplex movie theaters and modern walled communities with\nbygone names like Country Farms and Grant Ranch.\n\n   But Wednesday, 24 hours after two teen-age boys turned nearby\nColumbine High School into a killing field, many people here are\nmourning not just the sons and daughters who were cut down but also\nthe area's old-fashioned sense of safety and maybe even its\nold-fashioned faith in the future.\n\n   ``This used to be one of the quietest places in the state,''\nsaid Kay Chambers, the box officer manager of the Town Hall Arts\nCenter. ``Now, it just feels like the world is out of control, that\nit is a much more violent and dangerous place. When I look at\nwhat's going on in Kosovo and Africa and now here, it breaks my\nheart.''\n\n   Still, people here say they leave their doors unlocked and most\nsaid they had no plans to lock them _ yet. There are dozens of\nhomeowner associations, ball fields, tennis courts, a new nature\npath and three or four forests worth of new houses going up.\n\n   Downtown Denver is about 10 miles away and it seems as though\nevery one of those miles is filled with strip malls, fast-food\nrestaurants and commuters.\n\n   ``There's been so much growth, we can't even get across the\nstreet any more,'' said Marion Nygren, who has lived here for 40\nyears.\n\n   And every summer, this middle- to upper-middle-class city of\n40,000 residents holds its Western Welcome Week with hand-cart\nraces, a firemen's tug-of-war and square dancing in the streets.\n\n   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' said Jared Smith, 18, after\nhe left flowers outside the high school to remember the dead and\nwounded. ``This is the last community you'd think something like\nthis would happen.''\n\n   Littleton was founded in 1890, and its early residents were\nmostly farmers and gold prospectors. The first industry in town was\nthe Rough and Ready grain mill on the South Platte River, where\nbaptisms were sometimes performed.\n\n   After World War II, ranching and farming gave way to electronics\nand the aerospace industry, still a factor today, and Littleton's\npopulation began to skyrocket, making longtime residents like Marty\nGarcia a little worried that perhaps Littleton was moving too fast.\n\n   ``It's still nice, but it used to be a whole lot nicer,'' said\nGarcia, the owner of a barber shop in the older downtown section of\nLittleton. ``Today, people are moving so fast that they just don't\nseem to take the time to pass the time of day with their neighbors.\nMaybe if we did, maybe if we looked out more for each other, we\ncould prevent some of these tragedies.''\n\n   Columbine High's mailing address is in Littleton, but the school\nis actually in unincorporated Jefferson County. The school accepts\nstudents from around the area, and almost everyone refers to its\nlocation as Littleton. Wednesday here and in Denver almost everyone\nwas in mourning as school sessions were canceled, sporting events\nrescheduled and flags lowered to half staff.\n\n   ``We will get through this,'' said Rich Couris, who has lived in\nLittleton for just a few years after his employer transferred him\nhere from Southern California. His daughter, Kristin, is on the\nColumbine lacrosse team.\n\n   ``It's a real hodgepodge of incomes, talents, education,''\nCouris said of Littleton. ``It's a great mix and we love it.''\n\n   There is little racial diversity. The area is overwhelmingly\nwhite and heavily Republican, said Bill Babcock, the director of\nthe Town Hall center, who grew up in Denver and has lived here\nsince last July. ``It's a very conservative area,'' Babcock said.\n``I used to think that I was the only Democrat in town.''\n\n   Tony Amaro, who is Hispanic, moved to the area from California\nin 1992 after being transferred by the Union Pacific Railroad.\nAlthough Amaro said there had been a few times when he felt hostile\nstares from white residents, by and large, he said he and his\nfamily had not encountered racism here. That is why he was a little\nsurprised at some reports _ still not confirmed _ that the teen-age\ngunmen wanted to shoot the few black and Hispanic students who\nattend Columbine High.\n\n   ``This whole thing is mind boggling,'' Amaro said. ``I can't\nbelieve that somebody didn't see this coming, that somebody didn't\nsee that these kids were so troubled.''\n\n   Amaro came back to the school Wednesday with his daughter,\nCrystal, 17, who attends Columbine and saw a friend get shot.\n\n   ``She was helping a girl who was shot,'' he said. ``When she got\nhome, she found blood on her boots, her pants. We just tossed\neverything in the garbage. We're going to take her to counseling in\na few minutes. She just wanted to come by for another look. None of\nus can believe this happened.''\n\n   The police were still collecting evidence at Columbine\nWednesday. But once the school reopens, Andrea Grimm, 17, a senior,\nsaid she would be one of the first in line to go back to class.\nMiss Grimm was also there when the killing spree began and watched\nin horror as one victim staggered and then fell bleeding on the\nfloor.\n\n   ``I'm going back to graduate,'' she said. ``That's my main\ngoal.''\n","Headline":"\nDAY OF VIOLENCE THREATENS RESIDENTS' SENSE OF SAFETY AND FAITH IN\nTHE FUTURE \n","Text":["\n   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The good life is gobbling up the old life in\nevery direction around here.
