Times News Service   \n\n   The major record companies BMG and Sony Music Entertainment\nrecently announced long-awaited plans to sell their music online\nvia digital downloads. But the fine print suggests that mainstream\nInternet users are not going to buy their music digitally any time\nsoon.\n\n   Despite the promise of digital downloads for the masses, the\ntechnical challenges could continue to confine the audience mainly\nto that breed of technology-minded, time-wealthy human known as the\ncollege student.\n\n   Take the statement from BMG, which focused on the fact that the\ncompany had selected a half-dozen _ count 'em, six _ different\ntechnology partners to put its music online and to protect it from\npirates.\n\n   Even describing BMG's approach is rather complicated. But if you\ncan imagine having to download a different piece of software,\ndepending on whether you want to buy a digital single by Christina\nAguilera, Dave Matthews or Carlos Santana, then you begin to get a\nsense of the friction-free digital economy, BMG-style. (By the way,\nthe portable devices for playing the music in the various\nanti-piracy formats are not yet widely available.)\n\n   The record companies, though, say they have no choice but to\nconcede such complications if they want to start making music\navailable online. ``We want to make sure our artists' music is\nwidely available, accessible and protected,'' said Kevin Conroy,\nsenior vice president of new technology for BMG. ``We don't believe\nthat any single technology can deliver on that.''\n\n   Ready or not, the record companies are under pressure to make\ntheir music available over the Internet. They need to be responsive\nto investors, to take advantage of a potentially huge market\nopportunity, and to head off the persistent problem of online music\npiracy.\n\n   Forcing the issue are some Internet users who are freely\ntrafficking in copyrighted music online, seemingly oblivious to the\nconcept of theft. The music labels say that such trafficking _\noften involving copyrighted music that is digitally copied and\ndistributed via the Internet's infiniteness _ costs the labels and\nthe recording artists tens of millions of dollars a year in lost\nsales and royalties.\n\n   College students, while not the only ones to blame, have become\npiracy's poster children. They have motive: an abiding interest in\nrecorded music. And they have the opportunity: the time and\ntechnical skills to navigate the Net for music, download it and\n``rip'' their own CDs to place on the Net for others in an easily\ntraded software format called MP3.\n\n   The challenge for the record industry has been to find a way to\nencode its own intellectual property so that, once paid for and\ndownloaded by a buyer, the music can be stored and listened to only\nby the buyer. In other words, it cannot be easily pirated.\n\n   Developing this copyright protection turns out to be no small\ntechnological challenge. The record industry, in concert with\nelectronics makers in a forum called the Secure Digital Music\nInitiative, has spent over a year working out technical standards\nto achieve such a goal. The real fruits of that effort are\nscheduled to be on the market in the next six months in the form of\nportable devices that will not play songs that have been pirated.\n\n   So it represents no small victory for record labels and fans of\ntheir mainstream music that Sony and BMG have decided that they are\nready to start selling music online. Sony Music, home to Pearl Jam\nand Lauryn Hill, among others, plans to start selling singles from\nits Web site later this month. The songs will cost $2.49 to $3.49,\nroughly equivalent to prices of singles on CD or tape.\n\n   For its part, BMG says it plans to sell singles online by this\nsummer, with entire albums to be available later in the year. BMG\nhas not disclosed pricing, but in its tests and promotions in\nrecent months singles have sold for $1.99.\n\n   But for customers, at least in the early going, the psychic\ncosts could be much higher. BMG announced that it would make music\navailable in three different copyright-protecting formats from\nthree competing companies: IBM, InterTrust Technologies and\nMicrosoft. To process secure sales transactions, BMG chose to\nlicense competing technologies from Reciprocal and Digital World\nServices.\n\n   The BMG announcement drew criticism from operators of Web sites\nthat both sell songs and offer them free in the MP3 format. These\nsites do not traffic in pirated material but in music from\nindependent artists who are worried more about building an audience\nthan about preventing piracy. Operators of these sites contend that\nthe record labels are trying to treat consumers as guinea pigs for\ntesting different secure formats.\n\n   ``Do you want to support three different word-processor programs\non your computer?'' said Gene Hoffman, president and chief\nexecutive of e-music, a Web site that sells MP3 songs for 99 cents\na song and $2.99 an album. ``It's great they're entering the\nmarket,'' Hoffman said. ``But they make it very confusing.''\n\n   Conroy of BMG conceded that, for the near term, consumers might\nneed to have software capable of processing more than one format,\ndepending on which one any given song is encoded in. But longer\nterm, he said, ``we want to move as quickly as possible into\nnarrowing the choices.''\n\n   Indeed, he said the consumer could win, because the keepers of\nthe different formats will be forced to compete to prove they offer\nthe most user-friendly and secure way of downloading and buying\nmusic.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   ``It's a bit of a bake-off,'' said Andrea Cook Fleming, vice\npresident of Liquid Audio, the sixth of BMG's technology partners\nin digital music. BMG has licensed Liquid Audio to merge the\ndifferent digital rights systems under a single umbrella system to\nmake it easier for BMG to coordinate the various formats. ``They\nwant to create a competitive marketplace.''\n\n   All this raises the question of what Sony's technical plans are.\nFor its part, Sony chose to go with a single digital rights\nmanagement system, Microsoft Windows Media, and a single\ntransaction company, Reciprocal. Sony's rationale is that the\nWindows Media system is the only one now supported by a portable\ndevice that complies with the Secure Digital Music Initiative\napproach. Incidentally, that device is made by Sony.\n\n   To its credit, the prototype that Sony is showing off seems\nrelatively simple to use. Consumers so inclined can point and click\ntheir way to music downloads as easily as they might order a book\non Amazon.\n\n   Yet Sony Music officials said that as more devices emerge, they\nwould support other secure formats favored by the various\nmanufacturers, potentially creating confusion for consumers and\nonline retailers.\n\n   Sony's promise to publish music in other formats may sound more\nlike a threat. But Al Smith, a senior vice president at Sony Music\nEntertainment, predicted that before long, users will not care\nabout the type of format in which music is digitally compressed and\nencoded, because the devices will probably have a common interface.\n\n   Consumers can only hope he is right. Otherwise the music\nindustry can expect to continue to do business mainly on that\nbastion of time-wealthy, technology-wise, format-forgiving\nhumanity: the college campus.\n","Headline":"\nNEW ECONOMY COLUMN: DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNET MUSIC\nSALES \n","Text":["\n   The major record companies BMG and Sony Music Entertainment\nrecently announced long-awaited plans to sell their music online\nvia digital downloads.
