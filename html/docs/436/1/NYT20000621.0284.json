Echegoyen was transporting the\nsteel to Lufkin Industries, but turned the wrong way off Loop 287\nin Lufkin, the trooper said.\n\n   Malone said witnesses to the accident claimed Echegoyen pulled\nhis truck across the tracks ``and just kind of sat there'' until\nthe train struck the trailer.\n\n   ``If he'd backed up and kept backing, he'd have been OK,''\nMalone said.\n\n   No one was seriously injured in the accident, although\n47-year-old engineer Larry G. Cullins and 34-year-old conductor\nJoseph T. Debruhl, both of Houston, were taken to the Memorial\nHealth System of East Texas for precautionary measures. Also, DPS\ntroopers said Echegoyen complained of back pains at the scene.\n\n   The train's eight locomotives piled up after they struck the\ntruck trailer, while Malone said the steel from the trailer ``kind\nof looks like a roller coaster'' after it was bent in all different\ndirections from the impact. Sections of the railroad tracks also\nwere pushed aside.\n\n   Cullins said he was standing when he saw the 18-wheeler across\nthe railroad tracks in front of him, but that he and Debruhl hit\nthe floor of the locomotive and looked for something to hold onto\nbefore impact. Cullins said the estimated 15 seconds of the crash\nfelt more like a million.\n\n   ``When they tell you that your life flashes before your eyes _\nit does,'' the engineer said. ``It scared me, because I did not\nknow whether we were going to go sideways or stay upright or what.\nIt was scary. I feel very fortunate to have survived.''\n\n   There are no railroad crossing signals or gates at Neyland Road\nwhere it crosses the railroad tracks. But Smith said the truck\ndriver had at least a small amount of warning.\n\n   ``The train was blowing his horn,'' she said. ``I mean, he was\nsitting on that horn.''\n\n   No chemicals were being transported by the train, although the\nLufkin Fire Department was called to spray foam on a large amount\nof diesel fuel that spilled from the train's engines. The types of\nrail cars being pulled behind the locomotives included box cars,\ncovered hoppers, gondolas and auto racks, but it was not\nimmediately known if any new cars were being transported.\n\n   A railroad official at the scene said he could not comment on\nthe accident, but DPS Senior Trooper Bo Dunkin estimated that the\ntrain was traveling upwards of 50 mph when it hit the trailer. He\nsaid he believes locomotives have something that is similar to\nblack boxes in airplanes, and that railroad officials should be\nable to determine train speed, its horn usage and other data about\nthe wreck.\n\n   The DPS troopers said Union Pacific officials were expected to\nmove some of the wreckage aside and fix the tracks as soon as\npossible, since a high level of train traffic uses the rail line.\nBy early afternoon Wednesday, more than 100 employees of the\nrailroad and private companies were already working to clean up the\nscene.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   LUFKIN, Texas _ A Union Pacific train derailed between Lufkin\nand Burke on Wednesday morning after colliding with the trailer of\nan 18-wheeler that was loaded with steel beams.\n","\n   The truck's driver, 31-year-old Herbert Orlando Echegoyen of\nHouston, had pulled across the small Neyland Road railroad crossing\nto turn the truck around, according to Texas Department of Public\nSafety Senior Trooper Kevin Malone.
