One of the trains involved in Tuesday's crash was operated\nby Great Western Trains, which was fined $2.5 million for\nnegligence in the 1997 crash in the town of Southall.\n\n   Critics said Tuesday's crash was just the latest case of safety\ntaking a back seat to profit in the decade since Britain's rail\nservice was privatized.\n\n   Some claimed that Tuesday's disaster could have been averted if\nauthorities had implemented recommendations that followed a 1988\ncrash in Clapham that killed 35 and injured 500. Others noted that\nthe long delayed public inquiry into the Southall accident got\nunder way just two weeks ago, and wondered if a quicker review\nmight have yielded measures to prevent the latest wreck, just a few\nmiles west on the same tracks.\n\n   Preliminary investigation indicated that the smaller commuter\ntrain ran a red signal light, officials said.\n\n   The crash occurred at 8:11 on a crisp, sunny autumn morning, as\na Great Western train with up to 500 passengers headed east toward\nPaddington Station, one of the busiest in London. A Thames Trains\ncommuter service with about 150 people on board had pulled out of\nPaddington five minutes earlier and was heading west when it\ncollided with the eastbound train at an intersection about 2 miles\nwest of Paddington.\n\n   Investigators said the collision was nearly head-on and sent one\nof the Thames cars somersaulting over the Great Western train,\nshearing off the side of one car. Although the Great Western train\ntravels at up to 125 miles per hour and the Thames train at up to\n90 miles per hour, officials said both were traveling slower\nbecause of their promixity to Paddington.\n\n   Diesel fuel from the engines burst into flame, which officials\nblamed for causing many of the deaths and serious injuries. Most\npassengers on the express had boarded in western and central\nEngland and were heading to work in London.\n\n   One passenger, Dennis Colak, his suit jacket splattered with\nblood, said he and other passengers tried to break a window to free\nthose trapped in one blazing car.\n\n   ``There was one lady, screaming for help. We tried to get to\nher,'' he said, before he was overcome with emotion. He said the\nwoman perished.\n\n   Another passenger, Patrick Welcome, said he was in a Thames\nTrain car that was thrown onto its side by the impact. Just two\nweeks ago, he said, he was on a flight that overshot a runway in\nBangkok, Thailand. He survived that mishap without a scratch but\nfared worse Tuesday, suffering a gash to his forehead and a swollen\nknee. Welcome, who appeared dazed, was led away by police who said\nhe needed medical attention more than he needed to give media\ninterviews.\n\n   A makeshift medical triage unit was set up in a supermarket\nadjacent to the accident site. Dozens of the less seriously injured\nwere wrapped in powder blue blankets and offered tea.
