The jurors today will hear arguments in the\npunitive damages phase in the trial.\n\n   Railroad attorneys declined to comment Monday.\n\n   In closing arguments, plaintiff's lawyers accused Union Pacific\nof doing nothing to install lights and gates at the crossing a\nquarter-mile south of U.S. 50 near Warrensburg, Mo.\n\n   Plaintiff lawyer Grant L. Davis told jurors that 34-year-old\nKimberly Alcorn lived with pain ``like a window into hell'' because\nUnion Pacific waited instead of paying $200,000 for lights and\ngates.\n\n   ``This case is about corporate greed,'' Davis said, ``It's about\nputting dollars ahead of lives.''\n\n   State officials had told the company 11 months before the Aug.\n29, 1997, accident that the crossing was dangerous.\n\n   Union Pacific waited for government subsidies to pay for\ninstalling lights and gates, plaintiff lawyers argued. And the\nrailroad kept waiting, even after an Amtrak train hit a vehicle\nthere four months before the accident that disabled Alcorn.\n\n   Lawyers also cited testimony that Amtrak engineers did not apply\nbrakes until after the train hit the car Alcorn was in. The train\nwas traveling at 65 to 70 mph. The mother of two teen-agers\nsuffered brain damage, broken bones and disfiguring injuries, her\nlawyers said.\n\n   Ted Williams, an attorney for the railroad companies, told\njurors: ``You can see a train if you look.'' Williams told them to\nblame the accident on defendant Curtis Edwards, the driver of the\ncar hit by the train.\n\n   Davis, however, told jurors to remember the state report that\nsaid the view of the train was 90 percent blocked by brush and\nterrain. He said to remember, too, the testimony of an assistant\nAmtrak engineer who said he had narrowly missed several vehicles at\nthe crossing, including a propane truck.\n\n   Attorney John Rollins represented Edwards, a friend of Alcorn's,\nwho was driving her back to Sedalia after they visited an\nIndependence mall.\n\n   Rollins said that a sign which warned of a railway crossing was\nin a ditch and that Edwards did not know he was approaching the\ncrossing, which had a faded crossbuck sign. Rollins cited the\ntestimony of several area residents who said that it was hard to\nsee a train even if they stopped and looked.\n\n   Rollins said Union Pacific's attitude was ``we run the trains,\nwe make the money...but we're not responsible for safety.''\n\n   The jury found that Edwards was not at fault, but that Union\nPacific had acted ``with complete indifference to or conscious\ndisregard for the safety of others.''\n","Headline":"\nJURY AWARDS MORE THAN $40 MILLION TO WOMAN INJURED IN RAILROAD\nCROSSING COLLISION \n","Text":["\n   A Jackson County jury on Monday awarded more than $40 million to\na Sedalia, Mo., woman who suffered brain damage and more than 20\nbroken bones in a 1997 train-crossing accident.\n","\n   Jurors also found Union Pacific Railroad Co. liable for punitive\ndamages, which could add millions more to what lawyers say already\nis Missouri's largest rail-crossing-accident verdict.\n","\n   Union Pacific is 75 percent at fault, the jury decided, and\nAmtrak 25 percent as the jurors awarded actual damages of nearly\n$40.37 million.
