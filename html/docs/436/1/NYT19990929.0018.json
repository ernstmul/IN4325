The railroad knew\nthat the crossing on a gravel county road was dangerous, they\nargued.\n\n   Eleven months before Alcorn was injured in August 1997, state\nofficials had told the railroad that the view at the crossing was\n90 percent blocked by brush and terrain. The company and state\nofficials started the long process to get a government subsidy to\npay Union Pacific about $200,000 to install lights and gates.\n\n   In April 1997, four months before Alcorn's accident, an Amtrak\ntrain struck a truck at that intersection, killing a 22-year-old\nman. The railroad still did nothing, contending that such crossing\nupgrades were the state's responsibility.\n\n   On Aug. 29, 1997, an Amtrak train going 65-70 mph struck the car\nin which Alcorn was riding. She suffered brain damage, more than 20\nbroken bones and other injuries. One of her two teenage daughters\ntestified at trial that their mother no longer took care of them,\nbut that they took care of her.\n\n   The jury found Amtrak at fault for 25 percent of the $40.4\nmillion in actual damages but not liable for punitive damages.\n\n   On Tuesday, Union Pacific lawyer Ted Williams told jurors that\nhis company had properly been working with the state to upgrade the\ncrossing signal. Such upgrades are a state responsibility, he said,\nand railroads pay to maintain them after they are installed.\n\n   Union Pacific nationwide pays $26 million a year to maintain\ncrossings and $14 million a year for safety training programs such\nas Operation Lifesaver, Williams said.\n\n   ``This is not a company that doesn't care about crossing\nsafety,'' he said, and he asked jurors to assess no punitive\ndamages.\n\n   Plaintiff lawyer Grant L. Davis told jurors Tuesday that Union\nPacific had a net worth of $6.9 billion, but not even one employee\nto study whether crossings needed to be upgraded.\n\n   They do pay for crossing-signal upgrades in certain situations,\nDavis noted: ``They do it when there's something in it for them.''\n\n   They knew the crossing where Alcorn was injured was deadly, but\nthey did not think that was their problem, and they don't like to\npay to maintain upgraded crossings, Davis said.\n\n   All railroads stopped paying for upgrades after federal and\nstate subsidies for them were introduced in 1973, Davis told\njurors.\n\n   He summarized the railroad's attitude since: ``It's not our\ndeal; it's not our duty; we don't have to do it.''\n\n   Tell them otherwise, Davis asked jurors, and he requested a\npunitive damage award of up to $689 million.\n\n   After the verdict, several jurors told Davis in unison that\nsomething has to be done about the railroads before others are\nmaimed or killed in crossing accidents. ``Today!'' one juror\nshouted.\n\n   Mark Davis, a Union Pacific spokesman, declined to comment on\nthe verdict.\n","Headline":"\nJURY AWARDS $120 MILLION TO WOMAN INJURED AT RAIL CROSSING \n","Text":["\n   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Jackson County jury on Tuesday decided that\nthe nation's largest railroad company should pay $120 million in\npunitive damages to a Sedalia, Mo., woman severely injured in a\n1997 train crossing accident.\n","\n   Jurors said they wanted to force Union Pacific Railroad Co. and\nother railroads to pay to upgrade crossing signals.\n","\n   The punitive award is on top of the $40.4 million in actual\ndamages awarded a day earlier to plaintiff Kimberly Alcorn.\n","\n   Juror Vicky Willers of Independence said Tuesday that railroads\nmust pay for the signal improvements, rather than wait for\ngovernment agencies to do it.\n","\n   ``It's their railroads; it's their tracks _ they're\nresponsible,'' she said.\n","\n   Plaintiff lawyers hammered Union Pacific in the trial for not\nhaving paid to quickly install lights and gates on a crossing just\nsouth of U.S. 50 and east of Warrensburg, Mo.
