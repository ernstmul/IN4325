Later, the passengers were taken by Arlington\nschool buses to the Ramada Inn in downtown Fort Worth, where 175\nrooms were reserved for them.\n\n   John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington, said Sunday night\nthere was no indication of what caused the derailment.\n\n   The Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation\nSafety Board are investigating. Union Pacific Railroad crews were\ndispatched to help clear the tracks.\n\n   The train's silver cars sat crookedly off the tracks. Medical\ncrews stood by with stretchers, blankets and other equipment.\n\n   Passenger Bionica Mullins, 16, walked out of the wreckage\ncarrying her baggage to a truck belonging to a friend who came to\npick her up. She was on her way to Fort Worth from Benton, Ark.,\nwhen the train derailed.\n\n   ``It just came off the track,'' she said. ``I was sitting there\nand we felt a jerk and then it tipped over. I thought we were dead.\nI was waiting the whole time for the thing to cave in. I held on. I\nwas still in the chair. It was dark, and everybody was\nscrambling.''\n\n   Passenger Brian O'Brien, who was headed to Tucson, Ariz., said\nhe had just finished dinner when he felt the train come to a halt.\n\n   ``We hit the brakes hard,'' O'Brien said. ``You could feel him\nput on the emergency brakes. It chattered a bit, and then you could\nfeel it go on the ground.''\n\n   The derailment closed Division Street between Six Flags Drive\nand Stadium Drive. Arlington fire Lt. Pat English said it may be up\nto two days before Division is reopened while the wreckage is\ncleared and investigators try to determine the derailment's cause.\nHeavy equipment will be needed to clear wreckage, which also is\nnear power lines, English said.\n\n   The superliner originated in Chicago, where passengers said an\nelectrical problem caused a 11/2-hour delay, and was headed for Los\nAngeles via San Antonio.\n\n   The speed limit was recently raised to 60 mph on the Union\nPacific tracks used by up to 25 trains a day through Arlington,\nportions of Fort Worth and Grand Prairie in North Texas.\n\n   Several passengers said the train was traveling very fast, but\nEnglish said the passenger train was going ``much slower'' than 60\nmph.\n\n   ``We had just had that two- or three-hour delay, so I figured he\nwas making up for lost time,'' said Bob Toney of Nappanee, Ind.\n\n   The 15 injured were treated mostly for neck and back pain,\nEnglish said. One person was trapped in the train, but only because\na door was stuck, he said.\n\n   ``This could have been much, much worse,'' English said.\n\n   Six people were taken to Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center in\nGrand Prairie. Six others went to Arlington Memorial Hospital.\n\n   About two hours after the wreck, 150 passengers remained in\ntheir seats on the train, as tow trucks and ambulances lined\nDivision Street.\n\n   The same train ran over and killed a deaf woman earlier in the\nday near Jim Miller Road and Redbud Street in Pleasant Grove, the\nDallas County Medical Examiner's Office said.\n\n   Nancy Martinez, 33, was killed about 3:25 p.m. as she was\nwalking on the tracks, officials said. The death appeared to be\naccidental, but an autopsy was not scheduled to be complete until\nMonday.\n\n   The train was delayed in Pleasant Grove for about three hours\nfor the medical examiner's investigation and to remove the woman's\nbody from beneath the train.\n\n   (Jennifer Autrey, Kimberly Durnan, Jeanne Graham and Angie\nSummers contributed to this report, which includes material from\nThe Associated Press.)\n","Headline":"\nTRAIN INVOLVED IN EARLIER FATALITY DERAILS IN NORTH TEXAS, 15 HURT\n","Text":["\n   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Amtrak's Texas Eagle, bound from Chicago to\nLos Angeles with 199 holiday travelers, derailed near Six Flags\nOver Texas in Arlington Sunday night, injuring at least 15 people.\n","\n   Nine cars of the 13-car train left the tracks about 7 p.m., 31/2\nhours after the same train had hit and killed a deaf woman in\nDallas.\n","\n   Fifteen of the 199 passengers were taken to area hospitals with\nwhat were reported as minor injuries, and uninjured passengers were\nevacuated to the Meadowbrook Recreation Center in Arlington, blocks\nfrom the derailment.
