Times News Service   \n\n   ESCHEDE, Germany _ A high-speed passenger train roaring through\nnorthern Germany crashed into a concrete bridge pillar at 125 mph\nWednesday, spun from the tracks and killed at least 80 people,\npossibly including children on a school excursion. Hundreds more\nwere injured.\n\n   German Railways officials called it the worst crash in post-war\nGerman history and the worst in Europe in decades. The crash\nstunned Germany, which prides itself on the safety and speed of the\naerodynamic silver-and-red Inter-City-Express system.\n\n   Rail officials said the final toll could exceed 100. Wednesday\nnight, huge cranes were still trying to lift debris from two\ncrushed railroad cars in which anyone still living, a medical\nofficial said, had only a ``minimal'' chance of surviving.\n\n   Inter-City-Express 884 crashed just south of the small station\nin Eschede, a town of 6,000, 35 miles north of Hanover. As it\napproached the station, on its 500-mile journey from Munich to\nHamburg, it had been right on time at 10:59 a.m. The bullet-nosed\nlocomotive pulling a 13-car train sped under a road-bridge as the\ncarriages behind it twisted out of control, according to accounts\nby rescue workers, police and railway officials.\n\n   ``I saw nothing on the tracks as I went under the bridge,'' said\nthe driver, who survived unharmed. His name was not immediately\nreleased. ``Then there was a vibration. Then the automatic brakes\ncame on,'' he told German television.\n\n   The brakes came on, railway officials said, because the\nlocomotive had been severed from the rest of the 1,200-foot-long\ntrain. It sped alone unscathed for hundreds of yards along the\ntracks until it came to a halt. Only at that point, said Gisel\nLunig, an official investigator, did the driver realize what had\nhappened.\n\n   The first two carriages immediately behind the locomotive seemed\nto have remained crookedly on the tracks. But others behind them\ncareened over a leafy embankment, leaving their iron wheels in\nplace as the carriages sheared away.\n\n   Then, the bridge came crashing down, burying two cars full of\npeople as five or six more cars folded together like playing-cards,\ncreating a sculpture of horror that rose up where the road-bridge\nhad once been.\n\n   ``There was a loud noise, like a helicopter, a crashing, and\nthen there were railway carriages in front of my door,'' said a\nwoman living near the tracks, who asked not to be identified by\nname.\n\n   Then, for a moment, all was quiet. ``There was the silence of\nthe dead,'' said Gerhard Bleyl, a former mineworker, who said he\nwas among the first to arrive at the wreck. ``Then we saw about 20\nor 30 people who had managed to escape. Noone said anything. Then\nwe heard whimpering and screams.''\n\n   ``There were legs, arms, from adults and children, men and\nwomen,'' said one rescue worker who lives near the tracks and who\nasked not to be identified by name.\n\n   ``You could hear children crying for their mothers,'' said\nBleyl, whose home is also close to the tracks. ``This is the worst\nthing I have ever seen,'' said a fire service officer, Andreas\nKoch. ``It is the worst thing anyone has seen.''\n\n   Seats and suitcases had been thrown clear of the train along\nwith splinters of metal and chunks of concrete from the bridge.\nSome passengers smashed their way out of the windows.\n\n   Railway officials and police said they believed two groups of\nschool-children may have been been aboard the train and were\npossibly in the cars trapped under the debris of the collapsed\nroad-bridge.\n\n   Medical workers set up a field-hospital to perform emergency\nsurgery on survivors while others were taken by helicopter to\nhospitals in Hamburg, Hanover, Bremen and elsewhere. Hearses queued\nto take the dead away.\n\n   All in all, around 1,200 rescue workers _ both civilian and\nmilitary _ were drafted into the battle to locate survivors from\nthe 759-seat train. ``There was one woman. She was injured herself.\nBut all she could do was scream for her three-year-old child,''\nsaid Barbel Joachim, a rescue helper, ``So I went to look for the\nchild and she was injured.''\n\n   Railways officials and police originally said around 300 people\nwere injured in Wednesday's crash. By Wednesday evening, nine hours\nafter crash, German television said that more than 100 bodies had\nbeen pulled from the wreckage, but police did not confirm this\nfigure.\n\n   The ICE trains can travel at speeds of up 175 mph on special\ntracks and routinely travel at 125 mph on the stretch where the\naccident happened, railway officials said.\n\n   ''The train is regarded as the safest in Germany,'' a German\nRailways spokesman said. Since the ICE trains came into service in\n1991, none of the 104 trains in the fleet had been involved in a\nfatal accident, he said. The ICE trains have airline type seats,\nrestaurants and telephones.\n\n   By Wednesday night, there was no clear explanation of why the\ntrain had derailed and struck the central pillar supporting the\nroad-bridge. Police and railways officials said they could not\nconfirm early reports that a car atop the road-bridge had somehow\nswerved through safety barriers to land on the tracks in the path\nof the train or on the train itself.\n\n   ``As far as the cause of this accident is concerned, we are\nstill in the area of speculation,'' said Joachim Lindenberg, a\npolice spokesman. He confirmed, however, that the ruins of a car\nhad been found in the wreckage, but said it was unclear whether the\ncar finished up there after the bridge collapsed when the train\nploughed into it.\n\n   Chancellor Helmut Kohl cut short a visit to Italy to return to\nGermany. His challenger in September's election, Gerhard Schroder,\ncalled off a political rally in Hanover. The authorities in Bonn\nordered that flags be flown at half-staff on public buildings. ``I\nam lost for words to comfort the bereaved,'' Kohl said.\n\n   The worst previous rail disaster in western Germany in the past\n53 years was just after World War II when a U.S. transport train\nloaded with tanks collided with a trainload of German war\nprisoners.
