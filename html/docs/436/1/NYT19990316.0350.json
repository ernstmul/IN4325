WALD   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   WASHINGTON _ The federal government says it has been working\nhard since 1991 to reduce the chances of train-vehicle collisions\nlike the one Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill., but the railroad\ncrossing there was one the government said had already been fixed.\n\n   ``It had the best we've got,'' said Jolene Molitoris,\nadministrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\n   Ms. Molitoris said the Bourbonnais crossing had gates, lights\nand a computerized system designed to ensure that warning lights\nflash and the gates come down 25 to 30 seconds before a train\narrives, regardless of its speed. If gates come down more than 30\nseconds in advance, drivers may gradually become convinced that the\nwarning system is crying wolf and that they have time to go around.\n\n   The improvements in Bourbonnais cost about $150,000 five years\nago, making it one of the best-equipped of the approximately\n260,000 grade-level railroad crossings in the country, Ms.\nMolitoris said. Only about 62,000 crossings, fewer than 40 percent,\nhave any active warning system _ gates, lights or bells.\n\n   The federal Transportation Department is testing systems that\nare more difficult to circumvent. One, in Mystic, Conn., has gates\nthat come down over all four lanes of the road, so a driver cannot\ncross the double yellow line and drive around them.\n\n   In this fiscal year, the Transportation Department is providing\n$154.8 million to states to improve crossings. A flashing signal\nsystem can cost $60,000, and a gate across a single lane can cost\n$15,000. An overpass or tunnel costs millions of dollars.\nImprovements are made by local or state highway departments, or the\nrailroads themselves, not the federal government.\n\n   The Transportation Department is trying to reduce the number of\ncrossings so that improvements can be concentrated on those that\nremain.\n\n   ``The best crossing is the one that doesn't exist,'' said Warren\nFlateau, a department spokesman.\n\n   When the federal government began its campaign in 1991, there\nwere more than 290,000 grade-level crossings, but by this year,\n33,000 of them had been closed. The goal is to eliminate at least\nanother 30,000.\n\n   The strategy is working, officials say. Last year there were 422\ndeaths in crossing accidents, down one-third from five years ago.\n\n   The small towns around Chicago, long a railroad hub, are ground\nzero for such accidents. Seven high school students died in 1995 in\nFox River Grove when a train plowed into the back of their school\nbus while it was stopped for a traffic light, its rear hanging over\nthe tracks.\n\n   Of the 3,030 accidents at public railroad crossings counted by\nthe Federal Railroad Administration in 1998, 175 were in Illinois.\nOnly two states had more, Texas, with 282, and Indiana, with 178.\nAmtrak was involved in 139.\n\n   The numbers are gradually improving; in 1995, there were 4,154\nsuch accidents, more than a third more than in 1998.\n\n   According to the Federal Railroad Administration, the number of\ntrain-vehicle collisions is falling in Illinois, too, down 15\npercent since 1996.\n\n   The agency has tried a variety of tactics to reduce collisions.\nIn an effort to improve law enforcement, it has arranged for police\nofficers to ride in the cabs of freight trains, so they can see how\nmany drivers or pedestrians dash across the tracks in front of\nthem.\n\n   After the Fox River Grove collision, the Illinois Legislature\nset a minimum fine of $500 or 50 hours of community service for\ndrivers or pedestrians who cross in front of trains.\n\n   Passenger trains running at 79 mph can take more than a mile to\nstop; freight trains travel at slower speeds but they typically\nhave more cars, and can take just as long or longer to stop.
