Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Eighty-four people were hurt, three of them\ncritically, when a subway train derailed as it pulled out of a\nstation in downtown Brooklyn on Tuesday night, hurling passengers\ninto one another and against the train's windows, causing many head\ninjuries, the authorities said.\n\n   As the southbound B train left the DeKalb Avenue station at 9:57\np.m., the third car of the silver eight-car train slid off the\ntrack, pulling the second car with it, said Al O'Leary, a spokesman\nfor New York City Transit. The cars landed upright, but with a\nnoise that passengers said sounded like an explosion.\n\n   ``It was total chaos,'' said Tanya Acevedo, a passenger who was\nnursing a golfball-sized knob on her forehead. ``There were people\nyelling `Oh my God.' They were crying, they were screaming, they\nwere praying.''\n\n   Transit officials said they expected service on several subway\nlines to be disrupted at least through Wednesday morning rush hour\nand reshuffled the routes of those trains.\n\n   To clear the way for other trains, workers must lift three\n40-ton cars back onto the track, an operation which takes two hours\nper car under ideal conditions, O'Leary said. Damage to the tracks\nthemselves would cause further delay, he said.\n\n   The DeKalb Avenue station is one of several main transit hubs in\ndowntown Brooklyn. The B train was traveling on tracks normally\nused by the D train because there was a work train blocking the B's\ntracks, transit officials said.\n\n   The derailment occurred just a few carlengths out of the\nstation, where the track divides, O'Leary said.\n\n   ``The first two cars went to the left like they're supposed\nto,'' he said, ``but the third car went into the dividing wall''\nbetween the left and right tracks.\n\n   The derailment's cause was not immediately clear.\n\n   Marina Gerkerova, 22, a school counselor from Bay Ridge,\nBrooklyn, said the train started to jerk as it pulled out of the\nstation. Then there was a huge noise.\n\n   ``The train was off the track,'' she said. ``I saw us next to an\nN train and I thought we crashed into it.''\n\n   Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion , she said.\n\n   ``There were several people screaming,'' she said. ``A couple of\npeople were bleeding badly from their faces. When it happened I saw\nsmoke. The woman next to me grabbed my hand and we went flying into\nthe window.''\n\n   The woman looked over at her. ``There was blood coming down her\nface because she smashed in the window and broke it,'' Gerkerova\nsaid.\n\n   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that 10 people were taken to\nBrooklyn Hospital Center or to Bellevue Hospital Center in\nManhattan. One critically injured passenger had suffered a heart\nattack, he said, possibly caused in part by the 100-degree heat in\nthe subway tunnel.\n\n   ``People got shook up pretty badly,'' Giuliani said at the\nscene. ``Heads were injured and they bounced back and forth.''\n\n   Outside the station, at Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues, the scene\nwas one of controlled chaos on Tuesday night, with dozens of\nemergency vehicles swarming around the normally busy intersection\nand about 30 passengers waiting on a triage line as the police\nbarked orders at them.\n\n   Nearby, emergency medical technicians commandeered a city bus\nand turned it into a makeshift clinic, tying slings around injured\narms, wrapping knees in bandages, and applying ice packs. At 12:05\na.m., the bus carried 24 subway passengers the five blocks from the\nDeKalb station to Brooklyn Hospital Center.\n\n   Marsha Charles, who was on her way home after work, said it felt\nlike someone had pulled the emergency brake. Passengers fell to the\nfloor and skidded toward the front of their cars.\n\n   She said the conductor spoke over the loudspeaker, telling\npassengers he had been injured, and to wait where they were for\nparamedics to arrive.
