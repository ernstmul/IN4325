Times News Service   \n\n   NEW DELHI, India _ Two crowded trains hurtled head-on into each\nother early Monday morning, killing at least 210 people _ many of\nthem soldiers _ at a railroad station in eastern India near the\nborder of West Bengal and Assam, railway authorities said.\n\n   Throughout the day, rescue workers attempted to cut through the\nvast tangle of crushed coaches, trying to make their way to\nhundreds of bodies still trapped in the smoking wreckage.\n\n   The death toll was expected to rise sharply in what was already\none of the worst accidents in the history of India's rail system,\nwhich is the second biggest in the world after China's, and to a\nlarge extent a dilapidated relic of the colonial era. More than\n2,000 people were said to have been aboard the two trains.\n\n   The accident occurred at 1:55 a.m. at Gaisal station, about 250\nmiles north of Calcutta. It involved the Awadh-Assam Express, which\nwas bound for Guwahati, Assam's commercial capital, and the\nBrahmaputra Mail, which was headed for New Delhi carrying a large\nnumber of soldiers from the Border Security Force and the Central\nReserve Police Force.\n\n   While early reports indicated that the accident may have been\ncaused by a bomb, officials said later that an initial\ninvestigation pointed instead to a signal failure.\n\n   ``It is not an explosion or a bomb blast,'' M.G. Arora, a\nspokesman for Indian Railways, told Reuters. ``It is a collision of\ntwo trains.''\n\n   If a faulty signal was indeed the cause, it is likely to lead to\nrenewed criticism of the rail system, a public behemoth that each\nday transports 13 million people _ a good many of whom hang out the\ndoorways or cling to the roofs of stuffed cars _ and is notorious\nfor being a slipshod, uncomfortable and starved for funds.\n\n   Accidents are epidemic. Recent analyses of the system, a\nsprawling network with 37,000 miles of track, have attributed 70\npercent of the accidents to human error and 11 percent to failing\nequipment. The trains in Monday's crash were traveling along the\nsame track.\n\n   In the past four years, there have been eight major accidents in\nIndia, with death tolls ranging from 52 to 302. The worst railroad\ndisaster took place in 1981 when a cyclone blew a train into a\nriver in Bihar state, killing more than 800.\n\n   Monday's crash left coaches piled atop each other like logs on a\ncampfire. Survivors described being hurled through the air and\ndumped upside down. The dead, covered by white sheets, were laid\nout in long rows near the side of the tracks. Rescue operations\nwere slowed by the lack of a crane to lift one collapsed heap from\nanother.\n\n   ``I've never seen such a thing before,'' said Sameer Banarjee, a\ndistrict official reached near the scene by telephone. ``I can\nnever forget it. It was too terrible, in every way too terrible.''\n\n   Suitcases, broken glass and bedrolls were strewn across a large\narea. The injured wandered about, with pieces of torn clothing\nwrapped around their limbs to stop the bleeding or cover their\nburns. Medical students from a nearby college tended dazed and\nwounded passengers, most of whom had been asleep when the hulks of\nsteel hurtled into each other.\n\n   Weeping relatives attempted to identify the dead. ``Many bodies\ncould not be recognized,'' Banarjee said. ``They were burned and\nbattered beyond recognition.''\n","Headline":"\nMORE THAN 200 KNOWN DEAD IN COLLISION OF TRAINS IN INDIA \n","Text":["\n   NEW DELHI, India _ Two crowded trains hurtled head-on into each\nother early Monday morning, killing at least 210 people _ many of\nthem soldiers _ at a railroad station in eastern India near the\nborder of West Bengal and Assam, railway authorities said.\n","\n   Throughout the day, rescue workers attempted to cut through the\nvast tangle of crushed coaches, trying to make their way to\nhundreds of bodies still trapped in the smoking wreckage.\n","\n   The death toll was expected to rise sharply in what was already\none of the worst accidents in the history of India's rail system,\nwhich is the second biggest in the world after China's, and to a\nlarge extent a dilapidated relic of the colonial era.
