(See also TRAIN-VICTIMS) \n(mk) \n By PAM BELLUCK   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   CHICAGO _ Federal safety investigators on Wednesday began trying\nto identify the source of a set of tire tracks inside the crossing\ngate at the site of a deadly crash between an Amtrak train and a\nsemi-trailer truck Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill.\n\n   The tracks ``would indicate somebody tried to go around the\ngates,'' said John Goglia, a member of the National Transportation\nSafety Board. Investigators were trying to determine whether the\ntracks matched those of the truck, which would suggest that the\ntruck driver had tried to cross the tracks after being warned that\nthe train was coming.\n\n   On Wednesday night, at the exact time the crash occurred,\ninvestigators were using another locomotive and truck in the\npositions of the vehicles to determine when and if the truck driver\ncould have seen the oncoming train.\n\n   As the investigation continued, forensic pathologists were\ntrying to determine how many people had died, and who they were.\n\n   ``They were all mangled and burned,'' said Bill Cotter, a deputy\ncoroner with the Kankakee County coroner's office. ``They are so\nbadly damaged there is no way we can visually identify the bodies\nthat we do have.''\n\n   On Tuesday night, National Transportation Safety Board officials\nsaid that 13 people were dead and that three or four others were\nmissing. On Wednesday they said the number of dead had been lowered\nto 11. Based on updated Amtrak figures that indicated only 11\npeople on the train were unaccounted for, the officials said they\nbelieved there were no others missing. Amtrak officials said they\noriginally thought that 13 people were unaccounted for but\ndiscovered that two of those people had walked away from the crash.\n\n   But officials from the coroner's office said they still did not\nknow how many people died and they criticized the safety board for\nreleasing any figures. Cotter said he believed the confusion might\nhave arisen because the coroner's office had 13 body bags, although\nit was not clear that that meant there were 13 bodies.\n\n   ``We have body bags, but some of the body bags may contain body\nparts,'' Cotter said. ``And they may contain other body parts from\nthe people who survived the wreck.''\n\n   A federal team of 20 forensic pathologists, forensic dentists\nand FBI fingerprint experts drove in from Washington Wednesday with\na van packed with equipment and began working in a makeshift morgue\nin an abandoned lumber company.\n\n   They were gathering dental and medical records from families of\nthe missing.\n\n   ``Since most of the people are out of this area, this is going\nto take some time,'' Cotter said. ``We've got dental records coming\nfrom Mississippi and all over the United States, and Japan, too.''\n\n   Among those presumed dead, according to relatives, were three\nyoung girls and the grandmother of one of the girls, who were\nreturning home to Nesbit, Miss., after a trip to Chicago to see the\naquarium and shop at the American Girl doll store. They were\ntraveling with two children and two adults, some of whom were\ninjured. One of the relatives, Max Bonnin, who believes his wife\nand granddaughter are among the dead, said Wednesday that the\nconfusion about the number of victims has been frustrating.\n\n   Cotter said each family was assigned a representative from the\ncoroner's office and a local minister to help them through the\nordeal of waiting. He said the coroner, James Orrison, has been\nmeeting with the families twice a day.\n\n   The train, the City of New Orleans, left Chicago shortly after 8\np.m. Monday bound for New Orleans. Traveling 79 mph, it struck the\ntruck, which was packed full of heavy steel bars from a nearby\nsteel plant, at a railroad crossing in Bourbonnais, a rural\ncommunity about 55 miles south of Chicago.\n\n   The crash crumpled the train's two locomotives and the first\nthree of its 14 cars, smashing them together like an accordion. One\ncar flipped on its side and another, a double-decker sleeper car,\ncrashed into a locomotive, split in half and caught fire, burning\nthe passengers inside. Officials said Wednesday that all of the\ndead were in the sleeper car.\n\n   Of the 216 passengers and crew on board, 116 were injured, 49 of\nthem hospitalized.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.
