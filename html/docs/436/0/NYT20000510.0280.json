More trains would\ncarry travelers along two other corridors _ Miami to Tampa and\nTampa to Orlando. And new stations would pop up in Daytona Beach,\nStuart and other towns between Jacksonville and Miami.\n\n   Amtrak's plan, submitted at the request of the state Department\nof Transportation, would cost an estimated $354 million to $485\nmillion by 2005. The rail agency wants the state to split that bill\nfor track, station and crossing improvements and extra locomotives\nand coach cars. DOT administrators are expected to review the plan\nnext month.\n\n   The intercity passenger rail proposal comes a year after Gov.\nJob Bush derailed a proposed $6.3 billion bullet train connecting\nMiami, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa.\n\n   The extra service depends on Amtrak negotiating agreements with\nthe state and freight carriers CSX Transportation and Florida East\nCoast Railway, and commuter rail agency Tri-Rail.\n\n   ``It's doable,'' Amtrak spokesman Kevin Johnson said. ``It's\ngoing to take a lot of work, especially with getting the equipment\nto provide additional service, but we feel we can do it.''\n\n   Amtrak has already struck partnerships with nine other states,\nincluding New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, to expand passenger\nrail service as a way to reduce highway congestion, increase\neconomic development and provide another alternative for commuters.\n\n   The plan for Florida outlines improvements in four phases.\n\n   In the next three years, Amtrak will restructure its\nlong-distance passenger service to the Northeast. Three Silver line\ntrains now run once a day between New York and Miami. Between West\nPalm Beach and Jacksonville, the trains travel through Orlando and\nOcala and bypass some cities along the coast.\n\n   Under the new plan, one of the trains would switch to the FEC\nrail in Jacksonville and continue south along the east coast to\nSouth Florida. The train would make six or seven stops, including\nSt. Augustine, Daytona Beach and Stuart.\n\n   Amtrak has been negotiating for years with the FEC Railway about\nsharing its line with freight carriers. FEC officials said\nWednesday they remain hopeful an agreement can be reached.\n\n   According to FEC spokeswoman Jane Covington, the negotiations\ncenter on three issues _ safety, capacity and compensation.\n\n   ``Whenever you mix passenger trains and freight trains, that has\nto be an area of concern. And we want to ensure we have the\ncapacity to grow our own business,'' Covington said. ``We've made\nsignificant progress in working through these issues.''\n\n   The second phase, set for 2005, would increase daily service on\nthe Miami to Orlando, Miami to Tampa and Tampa to Orlando routes.\n\n   Amtrak projects 625,000 passengers would ride the Miami to\nOrlando train in the first year. This is about 7.2 percent of the\n11.5 million people that, according to DOT estimates, will make the\ntrip this year by car or plane.\n\n   ``What we hear and see is congestion on the highway is getting\nto the point where people are fed up,'' Johnson said. ``Using the\nairlines often is no better.''\n\n   After 2005, Amtrak would make improvements to the three rail\ncorridors to add more daily round trips and new stations. The\nimprovements would allow trains to increase the maximum speed from\n79 miles an hour to 110 miles an hour, cutting travel times.\n\n   By 2020, several new routes would be added, including Orlando to\nPort Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale to Naples and Jacksonville to\nPensacola. No cost estimates, travel times or ridership projections\nhave been developed for these projects.\n\n   chuckmcginness(at)pbpost.com\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Amtrak is proposing to connect Florida's\ncities like never before with greatly expanded passenger train\nservice and new stations over the next three to 20 years.\n","\n   Four trains would run a four-hour leg daily between West Palm\nBeach and Orlando, compared to two trains now.
