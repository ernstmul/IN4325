Times News Service clients)  \n BY BEVERLY FORD  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   Hundreds of cell phone users are calling 911 by accident,\nclogging the Valley's emergency switchboards and tying up operators\nfor crucial minutes as they try to determine whether the caller is\nin need of help.\n\n   The culprit apparently is the one-touch button on many phones\nthat's pre-programmed to dial 911.\n\n   ``It's a national problem,'' said Jim Wortham, the system\nadministrator for the Maricopa Association of 911 Emergency\nTelephone Systems, which coordinates Maricopa County's 911\noperation. He estimates that 15 to 20 percent of all 911 cell phone\ncalls are made in error.\n\n   The accidental calls often occur when the phone is jostled in a\npurse or car, Wortham said, and owners are unaware of them.\n\n   ``It's burdening the system,'' said Deputy Chief Robert Khan of\nthe Phoenix Fire Department, whose wife accidentally called 911\nwhen her phone activated while in her purse.\n\n   ``We've had open lines while operators try to determine whether\nthere was a car accident, a shooting or a fire, only to find that\nit's just someone singing along with their car radio,'' Khan said.\n\n   Phoenix 911 dispatchers alone receive about 500 accidental cell\nphone calls daily. Other communities average 10 to 30, Wortham\nsaid.\n\n   Officials said cell phone users can reduce the bogus calls by\nturning off their phones when they are not in use or by being more\ncareful handling them. Officials said cell phone owners also can\nreprogram the button to make sure it doesn't call 911 if pushed by\naccident.  \n","Headline":"\nCELL PHONES BLAMED FOR `911' FALSE ALARMS \n","Text":["\n   Hundreds of cell phone users are calling 911 by accident,\nclogging the Valley's emergency switchboards and tying up operators\nfor crucial minutes as they try to determine whether the caller is\nin need of help.\n","\n   The culprit apparently is the one-touch button on many phones\nthat's pre-programmed to dial 911.\n","\n   ``It's a national problem,'' said Jim Wortham, the system\nadministrator for the Maricopa Association of 911 Emergency\nTelephone Systems, which coordinates Maricopa County's 911\noperation.
