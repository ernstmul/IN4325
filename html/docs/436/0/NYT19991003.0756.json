IGOE  \n\n   Kansas City, Mo. _ Some heard her name on the news. Others heard\nthe hallway rumors.\n\n   Few believed it. Not Lucretia Henderson. Not that outgoing,\nfunny eighth-grader with the big smile. Not her.\n\n   So throughout the day Monday _ in between the calls of\ncondolence and the funeral planning _ Lucretia Henderson's mother\nfielded phone calls from her daughter's friends from school.\n\n   ``No, she's not here any more,'' Carmellia McGhee told callers.\n``She's not living anymore.''\n\n   Lucretia, 13, died Sunday afternoon, a day after she had been\naccidentally shot by a friend playing with a gun.\n\n   ``You know it can happen,'' said her aunt, Regina Porter, who\ngathered with other relatives at Lucretia's Kansas City home. ``But\nyou never expect it to happen to you.''\n\n   Lucretia was the first Kansas City juvenile to be shot\nunintentionally this year, police said. After the shooting\nSaturday, Darryl L. Morris, 20, was charged with one count each of\nsecond-degree assault and armed criminal action.\n\n   Monday, however, the Kansas City man instead faced upgraded\ncharges of involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action. If\nconvicted on both counts, Morris would face anywhere from three\nyears to life in prison.\n\n   Court documents report that the shooting happened this way:\n\n   About noon Saturday, Lucretia was riding in the front passenger\nseat of a car being driven by her cousin, Tyneshia Henderson, 21.\nIn the backseat were two friends, Dominic Ferguson, 21, and his\ncousin, Morris, who was sitting behind Lucretia.\n\n   Henderson noticed the men playing with a handgun. A shot erupted\nfrom the backseat. Henderson demanded the two stop playing; another\nshot was fired toward the front, shattering the windshield.\n\n   At that point Lucretia slumped forward. Her cousin started\nracing toward the hospital. On the way the car stopped, and Morris\njumped out with the gun and ran off.\n\n   At the hospital, the two told police what had happened.\n\n   About 11 p.m. Saturday night Morris turned himself in to police.\nHe ran because he was scared, he told them; it was an accident.\n\n   Such unintentional killings are not common in Kansas City,\npolice said. Statistics for 1996 showed that 376 juveniles were\nkilled in similar gun accidents nationwide, according to the Johns\nHopkins University's Center for Gun Policy and Research.\n\n   That figure has dropped in recent years, from 541 in 1990 to 440\nin 1995. No one is sure what accounts for the change, said Susan\nDeFrancesco, an assistant scientist with Johns Hopkins, which is\nexamining possible reasons behind the decline.\n\n   Accidental or not, Henderson's family is glad such tragedies are\ntreated as crimes.\n\n   ``Those kids are old enough to know you should not be playing\nwith guns,'' said McGhee. ``He just snuffed her life out from under\nher.''\n","Headline":"\nYOUNG WOMAN ACCIDENTLY KILLED IN GUN ACCIDENT \n","Text":["\n   Kansas City, Mo. _ Some heard her name on the news.
