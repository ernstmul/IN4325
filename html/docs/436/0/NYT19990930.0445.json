FRENCH   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   TOKYO _ In the worst accident in Japan's troubled history with\nnuclear power, an out-of-control chain reaction at a fuel\nfabrication plant near Tokyo spewed high levels of radiation into\nthe air beginning Thursday morning. Thirty-five people were\nexposed, three of whom were seriously injured, and 300,000 local\nresidents were ordered to stay indoors. The reaction was brought\nunder control early Friday morning.\n\n   Officials said the reaction was set off when workers\naccidentally poured 35 pounds of uranium into a purification tank\ncontaining nitric acid, instead of the 5.2 pounds normally used.\n\n   This mistake reportedly caused a flash of blue light inside the\nplant, owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Scientists said the flash\nmay have been the result of a fast chain reaction.\n\n   Tokyo Electric Power Co. rushed 880 pounds of sodium borate to\nthe plant, but the authorities said they had no way of getting\nclose enough to the processing tank to dump the radiation-absorbing\npowder onto it.\n\n   When initial efforts to stop the reaction failed, the government\nordered residents of areas near the plant, in the town of\nTokaimura, to stay indoors. A primary school, a kindergarten, a\nnumber of shops and several homes were all located within the\naffected area.\n\n   For most of the day Thursday, the government made little fuss\nabout the accident, closing off a three-mile perimeter around the\narea and warning residents to keep their windows shut. By late\nThursday evening, the East Japan Railway, which serves the area,\nsuspended train traffic to the immediate region of the accident.\nMajor highways into the town were also closed, and electronic signs\nwere posted on small roads warning motorists to avoid the area.  \n\n   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was scheduled to name a new\ncabinet Friday but was forced by the incident to postpone the\nchange in government, apologized tacitly for the slow official\nreaction. ``We must obtain decisions from scientists, technicians\nand experts'' to assess such accidents, the prime minister told\nreporters at his residence, according to the Kyodo news agency,\nadding ``if they were slow in making decisions, we must make sure\nthat that never happens again.''\n\n   In the past, Japan has compounded other nuclear accidents with\nsimilarly slow, and often misleading, information given to the\npublic. Commentators here are already predicting a strong backlash\nin public opinion against the industry and perhaps too against a\ndeeply embarrassed government.\n\n   nn\n\n   The confused emergency response has been matched by a confused\npolitical one, with rival agencies alternately seeking to dismiss\nconcerns about Japan's vast nuclear energy program, or calling for\na sweeping reevaluation.\n\n   Early Friday, the chief of the government's Natural Resources\nand Energy Agency, Hirobumi Kawano, still ruled out the idea that a\n``criticality,'' or uncontrolled reaction, could occur at a nuclear\npower plant in Japan, and told reporters that he did not intend to\ninstruct power companies to re-examine their safety measures, Kyodo\nreported.\n\n   A top official of the Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry, however, said the accident was serious enough to lead\nJapan to reconsider its nuclear power policy. Japan operates 51\nnuclear power plants.\n\n   Officials requested the assistance of U.S. military forces in\nJapan to handle the accident. According to the Japan Self-Defense\nAgency, the government was informed that U.S. forces here are not\nequipped to deal with nuclear accidents.\n\n   The Japanese television network NHK said early Friday morning\nthat after repeated failed attempts to drain the tank by remote\ncontrol, emergency workers deliberately broke pipes leading to the\npurification chamber, allowing it to cool. Workers were attempting\nto insert hoses into the contaminated area to drench it with\nspecial chemicals to absorb the radiation.\n\n   In an indication that the accident was being brought under\ncontrol Friday, Japanese television said that at 6:30 a.m., the\nScience and Technology Agency reported that no radiation could be\ndetected at 14 monitoring sites around the plant.  \n\n   According to the Japanese Atomic Energy Research Institute,\nmeasurements of radiation levels at the plant were reported to have\nbeen from 10,000 to 20,000 times the normal levels.\n\n   ``It is an intense situation in which there is concern over the\ncontinued effects of radiation,'' Obuchi told an emergency task\nforce named late Thursday to oversee handling of the accident. ``We\nmust make certain to prioritize the safety of the residents.''\n\n   Obuchi's chief cabinet secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, said Thursday\nnight that units of Japan's Self-Defense Forces chemical warfare\nunit were being dispatched to the site of the fuel fabrication\nplant at Tokaimura, 87 miles northwest of Tokyo, but said that\nJapan was ``not capable of dealing with this kind of nuclear\naccident.''\n\n   Nonaka called the runaway reaction, known as a ``criticality\nevent'' in the jargon of the nuclear power industry, ``something\nthat Japan has never experienced.''\n\n   Government officials were meeting on the matter Friday.\n\n   Initial reports said that only three workers had been injured at\nthe site, and had been taken by helicopter to a hospital that\nspecialized in nuclear-related illnesses in Chiba prefecture to the\neast of Tokyo. Later, two of the workers were reported to be in\nserious condition, and a doctor involved in their treatment said\nthat all three of those initially reported injured had been exposed\nto ``a quite substantial amount of radiation.'' One is in critical\ncondition and has not recovered consciousness.\n\n   As it became apparent late Thursday that the accident had still\nnot been brought under control, more and more reports of\nradiation-related injuries trickled in. By dawn, authorities said,\nat least 35 people had been contaminated, including workers at a\nneighboring site, and the paramedics who helped evacuate the three\nworkers who were initially injured.\n\n   ``A major accident resulting in a radioactive leak has\nhappened,'' said Koji Kitani, president of the JCO Co. ``We\napologize from the bottoms of our hearts.''\n\n   The town of about 33,000 resident where the accident occurred,\nTokaimura, is home to more than a dozen nuclear-type plants, and\nwas the site of Japan's worst previous nuclear accident, in 1997.\nIn that incident, 37 workers were exposed to radiation after a fire\nin one of the plants was improperly extinguished and caused a small\nexplosion.\n\n   Lacking domestic petroleum resources, Japan heavily pushed the\ndevelopment of nuclear energy in the 1970s, following the oil\nshocks of that decade. The result is that the country is now\ndependent upon nuclear power for about one-third of its electricity\nneeds, among the highest of any country. The fuel made at the plant\nwhere the accident occurred is used in nuclear reactors nearby.\n\n   This familiarity with nuclear power has not allowed Japan to\navoid accidents, however, and in recent years, nuclear safety has\nincreasingly become a major political issue for the public.\n\n   In July, radiation estimated to be 11,500 times higher than\nnormal levels leaked out of faulty pipes in a nuclear reactor in\nthe town of Tsuruga, about 200 miles west of Tokyo.
