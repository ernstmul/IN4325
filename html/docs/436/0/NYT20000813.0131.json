Times News Service   \n\n   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ron Christie, the man with the job of making\nthe Olympic trains run on time, says there are ``no quick fixes''\nfor Sydney's rail network, which is plagued by problems as it\nprepares to double its traffic during the Games, which start Sept.\n15.\n\n   But Premier Bob Carr, whose New South Wales state government is\norganizing and underwriting the 2000 Olympics, hopes to quickly\nimprove the performance of the 800-mile, 300-station train system.\nIt is expected to have to handle 34 million passenger trips during\nthe Games, which run through Oct. 1.\n\n   More than 400 trains carrying half a million people are\nscheduled to run each day to and from the main venue, Olympic Park,\nwhere 15 sports arenas are clustered around the main 110,000-seat\nstadium seven miles from downtown. About 3,500 buses will also\ncarry Olympic spectators, most on highway lanes dedicated to Games\ntraffic.\n\n   Christie, the city's coordinator-general for rail, said there\nwere ``contingency plans to minimize disruptions,'' but added, ``it\nwould be naive to suggest there will be no rail incidents during\nthe Games.''\n\n   Five weeks from the start of the biggest Games in Olympic\nhistory, Sydney's rail lines are wracked with delays, derailments,\nerrors and incompetence.

The suburban accidents so far have been at low\nspeed, resulting only in minor injuries and damage.\n\n   At peak times on some of the busiest routes, only 75 percent of\ntrains have been on time.\n\n   ``There have been tremendous rail problems,'' Carr said. ``I\ndon't defend the performance.''
