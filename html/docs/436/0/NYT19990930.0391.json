Times News Service    \n\n   TOKYO _ In the worst accident in Japan's troubled history with\nnuclear power, an out-of-control chain reaction at a fuel\nfabrication plant near Tokyo spewed high levels of radiation into\nthe air beginning Thursday morning. Thirty-five people were\nexposed, three of whom were seriously injured, and 300,000 local\nresidents were ordered to stay indoors. The reaction was brought\nunder control early Friday morning.\n\n   Officials said the reaction was set off when workers\naccidentally poured 35 pounds of uranium into a purification tank\ncontaining nitric acid, instead of the 5.2 pounds normally used.\n\n   This mistake reportedly caused a flash of blue light inside the\nplant, owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Scientists said the flash\nmay have been the result of a fast chain reaction.\n\n   Tokyo Electric Power Co. rushed 880 pounds of sodium borate to\nthe plant, but the authorities said they had no way of getting\nclose enough to the processing tank to dump the radiation-absorbing\npowder onto it.\n\n   When initial efforts to stop the reaction failed, the government\nordered the residents of nearby areas to stay indoors. A primary\nschool, a kindergarten, a number of shops and several homes were\nall located within the affected area.\n\n   For most of the day Thursday, the government made little fuss\nabout the accident, closing off a three-mile perimeter around the\narea and warning residents to keep their windows shut. By late\nThursday evening, the East Japan Railway, which serves the area,\nsuspended train traffic to the immediate region of the accident.\nMajor highways into the town were also closed, and electronic signs\nwere posted on small roads warning motorists to avoid the area.  \n\n   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was scheduled to name a new\ncabinet Friday but was forced by the incident to postpone the\nchange in government, apologized tacitly for the slow official\nreaction. ``We must obtain decisions from scientists, technicians\nand experts'' to assess such accidents, the prime minister told\nreporters at his residence, according to the Kyodo news agency,\nadding ``if they were slow in making decisions, we must make sure\nthat that never happens again.''\n\n   In the past, Japan has compounded other nuclear accidents with\nsimilarly slow, and often misleading, information given to the\npublic.
