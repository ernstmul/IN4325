Rain began\nto fall in the hours after the accident, prompting concerns that it\ncould spread the radiation.\n\n   Government spokesman Hiromu Nonaka called the accident\n``unprecedented,'' although it is much more localized and less\nthreatening than an accident at a nuclear-energy plant such as\nChernobyl.\n\n   It is certain to raise concerns here about Japan's heavy\nreliance on nuclear power, particularly since it has already faced\na series of mishaps at nuclear facilities in recent years.\n\n   Experts say the reaction apparently occurring within the plant\ncould end any number of ways. It could, at some point, fizzle out\nonce it has used up its radioactive material. But there's also the\npossibility that the reaction could lead to some sort of chemical\nexplosion.\n\n   Japanese officials were slow to respond to the accident, and\ninitially played down its severity. At first, only 150 people\nliving within 350 yards of the plant were evacuated. Officials\nlater ordered 310,000 people living within a six-mile radius of the\nplant to remain indoors with their windows closed, but these\nwarnings did not come until 12 hours after the accident was first\nreported.\n\n   Officials, though, may not have known until late in the\nafternoon, hours after the accident, that a nuclear reaction was\ntaking place.\n\n   Three workers are believed to have caused the accident on\nThursday morning when they were engaged in the delicate and\ndangerous task of processing 35 pounds of uranium into fuel for\nnuclear power plants, according to Makata Ujihara, head of the\nTokyo office of JCO Co., the private company which operates the\nplant. The three workers reported that they saw a flash of blue\nlight, and then became nauseous and sick.\n\n   The blue light is thought to be a sign of a ``criticality\nincident,'' which is the point at which a nuclear chain reaction\noccurs, similar to what happens inside a nuclear reactor.\n\n   But a storage facility like the uranium processing plant does\nnot possess the controls or safeguards that a nuclear reactor\nwould. The three workers exposed to high levels of radiation were\ntransferred by helicopter from a local hospital to one specializing\nin radiation sickness.\n\n   Two of the workers are in a state of shock and have fever and\ndiarrhea, as well as highly elevated white blood cell counts,\naccording to hospital officials.\n\n   Eleven other workers plus five nearby residents are being\ntreated for lower-level radiation exposure.\n\n   ``We apologize from the bottom of our hearts,'' said Koji\nKitani, president of the operating firm JCO Co., as he bowed deeply\nin apology at a news conference.\n\n   Rain falling over the area is raising concern.
