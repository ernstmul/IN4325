Times News Service    \n\n   After a freezing May night in 1869 at an isolated Utah\nsettlement called Promontory Summit, a crowd gathered to watch as a\nfinal iron spike was driven into an unfinished railroad track. The\nspike and silver hammer, both wired to a telegraph line, made an\nelectrical connection that sent a signal through the nation's\nnetwork. It proclaimed the completion of the transcontinental\nrailroad whose tracks wound through the Sierra Nevada, thrust\nacross the central plains and splayed across the East Coast.\n\n   The impact of that rail line on American life was foreshadowed\nin the pulse of electrical current surging through a web of wires,\neasily overcoming distance and weather. It set off the first\nsimultaneous, nationwide celebration; in San Francisco and New\nYork, at the moment of contact, two cannons facing the Pacific and\nAtlantic fired shots, proclaiming that the United States was also\nprepared to extend its newly united presence outward.\n\n   Over a century later, that transcontinental project, completed\nafter decades of disease, accident, Indian attacks, bribery, stock\nfraud and utopian dreams, still seems unusually resonant. For this\ntoo is a period of technological transformation. Today's changes\ndon't require hammers and spikes or immigrant work crews chiseling\nthrough rock or forges turning out thousands of miles of rail.\nToday's networks are extensions of that telegraphic signal, not of\nthe tracks beneath it. They involve telecommunications companies\nand television cable companies, wireless telephones and computer\nnetworks, electronic transfers of cash and stock and commodities _\nthe exploding world of the Internet.\n\n   If the transcontinental railroad inspired grandiose hopes for\nsocial transformation, the prospects for e-commerce, e-mail and\ne-fraud have raised similar expectations and worries. An 1846\nCincinnati newspaper mocked the utopian claims that a railroad\ncould ``create settlements, commerce and wealth;'' the project's\nsupporters, the paper suggested, might as well be promising ``to\nunite neighboring planets in our solar system and make them better\nacquainted with each other.''\n\n   Do Internet visionaries predict anything less?\n\n   This may be why building railroads is getting some unusual\nattention, including a large new 797-page chronicle of the\nconstruction of America's transcontinental railroad, ``Empire\nExpress'' (Viking) by David Haward Bain. Railroads have always\nattracted hobbyists and specialists. Historians have also had a\nstrong interest in the railroad's impact on regional cultures.\n\n   But the attention has recently broadened, echoing the energies\nnow being poured into proliferating books about the Internet. A\nspecial series devoted to railroads published by Indiana University\nPress, deals with such arcana as the Chicago South Shore Railroad\nand the now extinct ``ghost railroads'' of Tennessee and Kentucky;\nthe publisher is offering railroad histories that have been\nunavailable for more than 30 years.\n\n   Current rail obsessions go even further: it is not just the\nobjects that entrance, it is the way that _ with Internet swiftness\n_ they altered the surrounding cultural universe. In England,\nargues an Oxford lecturer, Michael Freeman, in a new book,\n``Railways and the Victorian Imagination'' (Yale), the railroad\nweakened the aristocracy, changed the geography and populations of\nthe cities, led to the beginnings of an organized stock market and\ninspired a half century of art with its sublime energies\n\n   In the United States, with fewer established institutions to\nchange, Bain's account suggests that the construction of the tracks\nmay have had as much impact as the trains running on them.

Materials may\nhave been scarce and the government was often in crisis, but\nLincoln (who had worked as an attorney for a railroad), saw the\ntranscontinental as a way of binding East and West, just as the war\nwas fought to bind North and South.\n\n   The railroad was a new technology, an industrial version of the\n``information superhighway'' requiring continuous innovation.\nRailroads spurred extraordinary feats of engineering, as William D.\nMiddleton's recent book, ``Landmarks on the Iron Road'' (Indiana)\nshows. Nature had to be resculptured; tunnels had to be dug and\nbridges mounted over precipices. The transcontinental required an\n800-foot-long, 63-foot-deep cut through a pass in the Sierra\nNevada; it was blasted through at the pace of a foot a day.
