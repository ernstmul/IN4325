Times News Service    \n\n   It is one of most common gun accidents: A person picks up a\nsemiautomatic pistol, takes out the magazine containing the\ncartridges and, thinking the weapon is empty, squeezes the trigger\nand shoots himself or someone else.\n\n   When a semiautomatic's magazine is removed, a round can remain\nin the chamber, ready to be fired, and scores of people, from\nadults cleaning guns to children playing with them, have died or\nbeen seriously hurt in recent years as a result.\n\n   Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some have\nresponded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism\nknown as a magazine safety. But the fact that many gun makers have\nchosen not to use simple devices like magazine safeties and gun\nlocks is now a focus of a growing wave of lawsuits in which cities\nare accusing the firearms industry of making guns needlessly\ndangerous.\n\n   A look at how gun makers have chosen to use, or not use, the\nmagazine safety provides a glimpse into an industry driven by\nunique marketing forces. In the absence of government safety\nregulation, different companies set their own standards, and\nproducers have not sought independent answers about safety issues\nor been able to reach internal consensus on them.\n\n   For decades, the nation's biggest gun maker, Smith & Wesson, has\nincorporated a magazine safety, a mechanism made of a few springs\nand a lever that can cost as little as 9 cents, in virtually every\nsemiautomatic pistol it sold to the public. Other companies have\nnever used one.\n\n   Beretta uses the device in a few models but not others. Some\nmanufacturers offer it as an option to law enforcement but not to\nthe public. One manufacturer stamps a warning about the firing\ndanger onto a pistol. Another puts a caution sticker on the\nmagazine. Others say nothing on the gun.\n\n   Gun makers have a simple response to questions about the\nmagazine safety, as well as the safety lawsuits: People know that\nguns are dangerous, gun owners need training, and they need to keep\nweapons away from children. Faced with the prospect of federal\nregulation, gun makers recently began to distribute safety locks,\nbut both the industry and groups like the National Rifle\nAssociation oppose mandatory safety requirements.\n\n   ``We leave it up to each individual company to manufacture what\nthey think is the safest, highest quality product as they see fit\nand leave it to the consumer to buy the gun that best fits their\nneeds,'' said Andrew Kelley, a spokesman for Sporting Arms and\nAmmunition Manufacturers Institute, a trade group in Newtown, Conn.\n\n   For every gun maker that cites safety as a reason for using the\nmagazine device, another contends it could make a gun less\nreliable. Other consumer industries form internal task forces to\nresolve such debates, or refer them to independent technical\ngroups, such as Underwriters Laboratories Inc., which have set\nstandards for products from children's pajamas to hair dryers.\n\n   But while the gun industry's group, the Sporting Arms and\nAmmunition Institute, has set technical standards for bullets, it\nhas not researched the value of internal safety devices like the\nmagazine safety, Kelley said.\n\n   There is little question that some accidental shooting deaths\ncould be prevented if gun owners handled and stored their weapons\nmore safely. And such deaths have fallen steadily over the last two\ndecades.\n\n   Still, in 1996, the most recent year for which federal data are\navailable, 1,134 people were killed in such incidents, 135 of them\nchildren under 14.\n\n   The shootings occur for various reasons. Many involve hunting.\nOthers happen when a gun is dropped. But a 1991 study by the\nGeneral Accounting Office, a congressional agency, found that\nnearly a fourth occurred because the person who picked up a gun\nthought it was unloaded.\n\n   No single device _ and gun makers can choose from many _ can\neliminate such shootings. But the gun industry's scattershot\napproach to safety involves producers of inexpensive and costly\nguns alike.\n\n   For expensive pistols, the marketing chain often starts with\nmilitary or police agencies. Gun makers can use their success in\nthat arena to sell the same weapon to consumers.\n\n   ``Whatever gun the cop carries, the civilian aspires to carry,''\nsaid Joseph Cartabona, director of handguns for Colt's\nManufacturing in West Hartford, Conn.\n\n   Many law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI, do not want a\nmagazine safety. Their reasoning: that being able to fire the\nbullet remaining in the chamber could save the life of an officer\nwho changes his magazine or accidentally releases it during a\ngunfight.\n\n   But firearms experts who have looked for such cases say they\nhave found few. Instead, experts like Massad Ayoob, a police\ncaptain who is director of the Lethal Force Institute, a training\nacademy in Concord, N.H., say they have found more instances where\nofficers with magazine safeties avoided being shot with their own\nguns by ejecting the magazine during a struggle.\n\n   ``It acts as a kind of kill button,'' Ayoob said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Between 1988 and 1997, 62 police officers nationwide were killed\nwith their own weapons, according to the FBI.\n\n   Beretta and Sig Arms do not normally put the safety in their\npistols, but will if law-enforcement agencies want it. Neither\ncompany gives the public that option.\n\n   ``There has been no commercial call for it or request for it,''\nsaid Wesley Lang, the vice president of marketing for Sig Arms,\nbased in Exeter, N.H.\n\n   Whatever the merits of the device for police work, guns stripped\nof safety features for military or police use are then sold to\nconsumers, who often lack training. Such guns include\nsemiautomatics made by Glock Inc., which are used by about half of\nthe country's police departments.\n\n   Glock pistols, designed in the early 1980s for the Austrian\nmilitary, have also been a big hit with consumers, who now account\nfor half of all sales. The Glock has several safety features, but\nlacks both a magazine safety and a manual safety, the lever found\non many pistols that must be pushed for the gun to fire.\n\n   Such mechanical factors combined with poor training may be\nbehind many accidental deaths and injuries involving Glock pistols.\nIn the last decade, about 60 accidental shooting lawsuits have been\nfiled against Glock, of Smyrna, Ga., according to Firearms\nLitigation Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in Washington, and the\ncompany says it is facing about 20 such suits, 40 percent of which\ninvolve consumers.\n\n   Glock denies any blame for the incidents and it has won all nine\ncases that have gone to trial, said the company's general counsel,\nPaul Jannuzzo. But it has settled other suits.\n\n   ``The gun is the best tool of its kind available, be it for a\npoliceman or a civilian,'' Jannuzzo said. ``It strikes the proper\nbalance between safety and usability.''\n\n   Only a few lawsuits specifically charging that an accidental\nshooting resulted from the lack of a magazine safety have gone to\ntrial, and gun makers have won them. Several more are pending,\nincluding one involving the 1996 death of Ross Mathieu, the\n12-year-old boy in Massachusetts shot by a friend who thought a\npistol without its magazine was empty.\n\n   But in the last three decades, gun makers have quietly settled\ndozens of such cases, say plaintiffs' lawyers and expert witnesses\nwho have testified for them. Stanton Berg, a firearms consultant in\nMinneapolis, said he had been involved in about 30 suits involving\nthe lack of a magazine safety, nearly all of which were settled.\n\n   Another firearms expert, Lama Martin, the president of Forensic\nBallistics Inc., a consulting firm in Bel Air, Md., said he had\nbeen involved in about six cases that were settled. He said that\nany gun sold to the public should have at least three devices: a\nmanual safety, a magazine safety and a safety to prevent the gun\nfrom firing if it is dropped.\n\n   ``The average civilian has received no training,'' Martin said.\n``He needs all the help he can get.''\n\n   The settlements have not prompted the industry to use magazine\nsafeties. Jeffrey Reh, general counsel of Beretta USA in Accokeek,\nMd., which has settled two of those cases, said the magazine safety\nhas pros and cons.\n\n   Reh said the safety can prevent someone from accidentally firing\na gun that they think is unloaded because the magazine is removed.\nBut deadly accidents have happened with guns that have the safety,\nhe said, when someone inserted an empty magazine in the pistol.\nThat disengages the safety and allows the remaining bullet to be\nfired.\n\n   He also said that a homeowner needing a gun in a hurry for\nself-defense might not be able to use it if the gun had a safety\nand he fumbled with a magazine.\n\n   ``It is what we call a neutral feature,'' Reh said.\n\n   That does not explain why some Beretta guns sold to the public\nhave magazine safeties and others do not. Reh said none of the guns\nmade by Beretta in the United States have magazine safeties, but\nthey are included in Berettas made by Fabbrica D'Armi Pietro\nBeretta, an Italian sister company.\n\n   Reh said he did not know for certain why the Italian company\nused the device, but he said the reason might stem from a 1968\nfederal law aimed at cheap handguns known as ``Saturday night\nspecials,'' most of which came from abroad at the time.\n\n   The 1968 law, the federal Gun Control Act, imposed a test based\non safety features on imported handguns. But the test did not apply\nto guns made in the United States, and domestic producers quickly\nmoved in to make inexpensive guns that did not meet the import\ntest.\n\n   In recent years, some gun makers have moved to make weapons less\ndangerous. But within the industry, currents can flow in several\ndirections.\n\n   For decades, virtually every Smith & Wesson pistol sold to the\npublic had a magazine safety because the company believed it could\nhelp prevent accidental shootings, said Kenneth Jorgensen, a\nspokesman for the gun maker. But several years ago, faced with the\npopularity of the Glock, Smith & Wesson started selling a competing\nline of inexpensive pistols known as its ``Sigma'' series.\n\n   The new pistol, like the Glock, does not have a magazine safety.\nInstead, it bears this warning stamped on the side: ``CAUTION:\nCapable of firing with the magazine removed.''\n","Headline":"\nGUN MAKERS' APPROACH TO BASIC SAFETY FEATURE VARIES WIDELY \n","Text":["\n   It is one of most common gun accidents: A person picks up a\nsemiautomatic pistol, takes out the magazine containing the\ncartridges and, thinking the weapon is empty, squeezes the trigger\nand shoots himself or someone else.\n","\n   When a semiautomatic's magazine is removed, a round can remain\nin the chamber, ready to be fired, and scores of people, from\nadults cleaning guns to children playing with them, have died or\nbeen seriously hurt in recent years as a result.\n","\n   Gun producers have long known of the danger, and some have\nresponded by building into their guns an inexpensive mechanism\nknown as a magazine safety.
