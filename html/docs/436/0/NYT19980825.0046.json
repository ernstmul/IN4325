She was seated in her bed in her South\nBoston apartment, propped up by the headboard. Straight ahead, on\ntop of a dresser, a television broadcast a late-night show.\n\n   Soon there was a swirl of police activity around Galvin's\nlifeless body as dozens of uniformed officers and plainclothes\ndetectives studied the situation. Outside, curious neighbors and\nreporters gathered.\n\n   ``The victim had an accidental discharge while cleaning her\nfirearm,'' a Boston police spokesman told the media several hours\nafter her death. Later, the spokesman said foul play and suicide\nhad been ruled out. The department's official report concluded:\n``Victim accidentally shot self while cleaning weapon.''\n\n   But Catherine Galvin didn't die accidentally.\n\n   A week later, after the glare of the media spotlight had faded,\nthe truth came out in the medical examiner's report: She had\ndeliberately killed herself, firing a single bullet from a\n.40-caliber handgun into her head.\n\n   It was obvious the night of her death what happened to Galvin,\ntwo officers at the scene told the Globe. But as she lay fatally\nwounded, police decided to tell the public that what happened this\nOctober night was a tragic accident.\n\n   The Galvin case was not an isolated one. Every year, hundreds of\npolice officers across the country commit suicide. They do so at an\nalarming rate, a rate that is much higher than that of the rest of\nthe population _ and rising. One expert calls it an epidemic.\n\n   The contributing factors are varied: stress, alcohol abuse, the\ndepressing grimness of police work, the frustration of office\npolitics. And unlike other high-stress jobs _ in medicine and\naviation, for instance _ police carry weapons that they can turn\nagainst themselves.\n\n   As in the Galvin case, dozens of those suicides are purposely\nmisclassified as accidents. Sometimes it's to ease the pain felt by\nsurvivors and ensure they get better death benefits. Often, it's to\nprotect the reputation of the dead officer and the department from\nwhat many police officers believe is a shameful act.\n\n   Police officers are twice as likely to kill themselves as to be\nkilled by a criminal, according to the National Association of\nPolice Chiefs in Miami. In Buffalo, one of the few in-depth studies\nof police deaths found that officers in that city were eight times\nas likely to kill themselves as they were to be slain in the line\nof duty. Buffalo officers were also three times more likely to kill\nthemselves than other city workers, the study found.\n\n   The Boston Police Department has one of the highest suicide\nrates in the country _ only slightly behind Atlanta, and more than\ndouble that of the New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago\ndepartments, according to a 1994 study of seven urban police forces\nby the New York City Council.\n\n   At least a dozen Boston officers killed themselves in the past\n10 years, a rate six times that of the rest of the working-age\npopulation in Massachusetts. An analysis of computerized records of\ndeaths in Massachusetts from 1989 to 1995 found at least 50 law\nenforcement deaths classified as suicides.\n\n   The number of actual suicides is believed to be substantially\nhigher because many are misclassified as accidents. In Buffalo, for\ninstance, one in five police deaths were suicides wrongly\nclassified as accidents.\n\n   Yet, despite the numbers _ and the occasional media attention\nwhen a police department experiences a rash of suicides, as New\nYork City did in 1994 _ the death of officers by their own hand\nremains one of law enforcement's most fiercely guarded secrets.\n\n   Many police agencies in Massachusetts contacted by the Globe\nrefused to discuss police suicides or provide documents on the\nsubject requested under the state's public records law. Police\nprefer to focus attention on officers killed in the line of duty,\nviewed as a more heroic death.   \n   \n   \nThe unwritten rule\n\n     \n  \n\n   In dozens of interviews, individual officers and detectives\nspoke of an unwritten rule: When confronted with the suicide of a\nfellow police officer, do everything possible to classify the death\nas an accident.\n\n   ``If there is even the slightest doubt about what happened, we\ngo with accidental,'' said one veteran police investigator. ``All\nyou need is something to hang your hat on.''\n\n   Usually, that something is a nearby gun-cleaning kit.\n\n   ``I was talking to a New York City cop, and when his dad went\nthrough the police academy, they told him that if you ever have the\nurge to eat your own gun, lay out gun cleaning equipment so it\nlooks like an accident,'' said John Violanti, a former New York\nstate trooper who has studied police suicide for a decade.\n\n   The ruse of gun cleaning is used for several reasons: One is to\navoid what some in law enforcement believe is the stigma of\nsuicide. Among police, suicide is often viewed as a cowardly act, a\nblack mark on the honor of a department. Many times, the suicide\nmay be the result of problems on the job, a fact police departments\nwant to keep private.\n\n   Another is financial: The families of officers killed in the\nline of duty are entitled to a $100,000 federal payment, maximum\npension benefits, and programs to pay for other expenses, including\nthe funeral. But the families of suicide victims may receive lower\npension benefits; some even lose life insurance payouts.\n\n   Yet, as well-meaning as some of the efforts to disguise suicide\nmay seem, there are consequences. In a culture of silence where the\nfinal act of desperate officers is hushed up, other officers who\nare feeling troubled and upset get the message: Don't talk about\nit.\n\n   ``These departments are telling an officer something: `Stress\ndoesn't exist, and don't catch it or you will be deviant,''' said\nJohn Carr, a former police officer who runs the Rhode Island\nCenturion program, a statewide service for stressed-out officers.\n\n   As many as one-third of the nation's police departments do not\nhave formal stress programs for officers or policies on protecting\nthe privacy of officers who seek help, Carr said.\n\n   Misrepresenting the cause of an officer's death, meanwhile,\nhurts the credibility of a profession the public relies on for\nscrupulous honesty.\n\n   ``I felt abandoned during some of these suicide\ninvestigations,'' said Boston Police Sergeant Richard Ross, a\nveteran detective who has investigated several deaths of police\nofficers and wrote about police suicide for his master's thesis at\nBoston University.\n\n     MORE     \n","Headline":"\nSUICIDE EPIDEMIC SPREADS THROUGH POLICE RANKS \n","Text":["\n   BOSTON _ The coverup of how Catherine Galvin died began almost\nas quickly as her life ended.\n","\n   Fellow officers found the 28-year-old state trooper just after\nmidnight on Oct. 29, 1994.
