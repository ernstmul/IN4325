Times News Service   \n\n   The elaborate layouts that replicate real railroads in real\nplaces in great detail are typically the province of modelers using\nsmall-scale rather than traditional-size (O-gauge) trains, which\nare approximately 1/48th the size of the prototypes.\n\n   For example, the yearbook ``Great Model Railroads '99,''\npublished by Model Railroader Magazine, features a layout of the\nold Boston & Maine Railroad's West Hoosic Division, which ran from\nNorth Adams, Mass., to Bennington, Vt., as it looked in the 1950s.\nThe scale is HO (or half-O), and one inch on the model locomotive\nequals 87 inches on the real thing. Smaller yet are N-scale (1:160)\ntrains that are decidedly not toys.\n\n   The 22-by-26-foot B&M layout, created by Lou Sassi, includes a\nhigh trestle, a stone-arch bridge, the Hoosac Tunnel and actual\nbuildings along the route, as well as trains that look like they've\nbeen around the track more than a few years. As Chris Smithson, a\nspokesman for MTH Electric Trains, said: ``No HO modeler with\nself-respect would run an engine right out of the box. If they\ndidn't totally rebuild it, they'd weather it.''\n\n   In fact, Lionel has introduced a Warhorse line of trains covered\nwith fake grit from smoking locomotives. Real trains rarely got\nweekend baths.\n\n   Newcomers or returnees to O-gauge railroading, on the other\nhand, are usually content with building a layout that fits on a\n4-foot-by-8-foot slab of green-painted plywood, adding a few\npreassembled or snap-together plastic structures like a village\ntrain station, a water tower, an engine house or a church.\n\n   Catalogs from Lionel and MTH offer a number of track schemes for\na basement-corner layout as well as accessories. But if the urge to\nrun a larger and more realistic railroad strikes, the hobbyist can\nturn to 3D Railroad Concept and Design from Abracadata\n(www.abracadata.com).     \n\n   The program, for both Windows and Macintosh computers, lets the\nuser imagine a layout, add structures and scenery and run virtual\ntrains to test the design. The CD-ROM includes a comprehensive 3D\nlibrary of actual products, from trains to trees, from 60\nmanufacturers.\n\n   Abracadata also has a nifty computer game for make-believe\nrailroaders with no room for a toy-train layout. 3D Railroad Master\nfor Windows 95 and 98 puts you in the cab of a diesel engine with\nrealistic controls to adjust speed, change the train's direction,\nblow the horn and hit the brakes to avoid game-ending derailments.\n\n   The rumble of the train over the tracks is realistic if tiresome\nafter a time, and thankfully the pop background music can be turned\noff. The progress of the Railroad Master train around a wide range\nof layouts can be viewed from the cab, from the front of the\nengine, from behind the caboose, from a helicopter hovering\noverhead or from cameras that can be placed at random along the\ntracks. Scenic backdrops range from desert to snow-capped mountains\nto big cities.\n\n   The timed games involve train orders to pick up and drop off\ncars or cargo and range from easy to difficult. And if the\nhigh-tech sound effects of the new O-gauge locomotives isn't\nenough, a new 80-minute CD called ``The Fading Giant: Sounds of\nSteam Railroading'' is available from O. Winston Link Railway\nProductions (4920 Buckhorn Rd. S.W., Roanoke, Va. 24014; $20).\n\n   O. Winston Link is the photographer who chronicled the last days\nof steam on the Norfolk & Western Railroad in 1957 and 1958.
