In all, 11 persons\nwere killed and 108 injured.\n\n   Quantifying the tragedy was difficult Sunday because police and\nfire departments as well as ambulance services and hospitals were\ntoo overwhelmed by the volume of accidents and injuries to compile\ncomplete figures.\n\n   By 8:30 p.m. law enforcement agencies had reported at least 430\naccidents in the metropolitan area and the number was bound to\nincrease, officers said. Kansas City had more than 200 accidents\nand Independence had logged 70.\n\n   Hospitals in Jackson, Clay and Platte counties in MIssouri and\nJohnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas had reported treating 108\naccident victims with injuries ranging from critical to minor. Most\nof the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n   On the stretch of Interstate 29 between Kansas City\nInternational Airport and St. Joseph, Mo., there were at least 50\naccidents involving 100 vehicles from about 1 to 3 p.m., according\nto the Missouri Highway Patrol.\n\n   Interstates and highways in the metropolitan area fared little\nbetter. Damaged cars and trucks littered the shoulders and medians\nof I-435, I-70, I-29 and I-35.\n\n   The worst accident was on I-29 near Missouri 273 north of Platte\nCity where five tractor-trailers and 19 other vehicles were\ninvolved in a chain-reaction crash.\n\n   Sgt. Jim McMillen of the Missouri Highway Patrol said the names\nof the dead probably wouldn't be released until today after\nrelatives were notified. He said one of the victims was a\ngrandfather from Florida who was visiting family in St. Joseph for\nhis 16-year-old grandchild's birthday party.\n\n   Identification of the victims was made more difficult because\nseveral of the bodies were burned and were difficult to reach\nbecause of the mangled wreckage.\n\n   Authorities were unsure of the cause of the accident, but\nMcMillen said one of those involved said visibility on the highway\nwas near zero.\n\n   He said that one or more of the vehicles began sliding about\n1:10 p.m. on the ice-covered highway. Before it was all over, five\ntractor-trailers had jackknifed and 19 other pickups and cars had\ncollided in the chain reaction.\n\n   One of the semitrailers caught fire. Because it was wedged in\nwith two other semis and about a dozen other vehicles, those\nvehicles also were engulfed in flames.\n\n   Six of the dead were burned, according to McMillen.\n\n   Several of the vehicles involved were welded together by the\nforce of the crash and the heat of the fires, and it was difficult\nto discern where one began and the other ended.\n\n   Rescuers had a difficult time getting to the wreck because of\ntraffic that was backed up for miles and heavy snow that cut\nvisibility to about 100 yards at 2:20 p.m.\n\n   Once they arrived they were met with a grisly scene. Several of\nthe victims who had burned in their cars were still inside.\n\n   The Highway Patrol closed I-29 for about 10 miles north of\nPlatte City. Traffic south of Platte City slowed to a crawl for\nmiles because of the fatal wreck.\n\n   Truckers were stranded at the nearby QuikTrip Travel Center.\n\n   ``There is absolutely no place to park,'' said Kathy Smith, a\ndiesel clerk at the store. ``We've got about 20 people standing\naround just at the phones. Truckers are parked everywhere, even on\nthe fuel islands, because there's no place to go. Even the\nMcDonald's lot is full.''\n\n   Many of the witnesses at the scene were still too distressed to\ncomment or declined to comment on the advice of their insurance\nagents.\n\n   The storm was not expected, and the ice proved a challenge for\neveryone.\n\n   ``We were having a heck of a time just getting around with the\ntow trucks,'' said Donald Adamson, a Northland Tow Service driver.\n\n   A separate multi-vehicle wreck forced police to close northbound\nInterstate 435 at Truman Road. Throughout the metropolitan area,\nstretches of road were shut to all but rescuers and tow truck\ndrivers.\n\n   The Missouri Department of Transportation tried to prepare for\nthe snow that had been forecast as a possibility by pretreating\nhighways and bridges, and crews expected to be out all Sunday\nnight. Still, so many cars collided that many drivers were told to\nwalk into police stations to report their wrecks.\n\n   Rescuers looking for a wreck near the Downtown Airport reported\nthat the Broadway bridge was coated with a sheet of ice.\n\n   Other rescuers reported similar scenes.\n\n   One ambulance crew reported seeing cars sliding off an exit ramp\nfrom I-29 and ``shooting right off the ramp and going\nupside-down.''\n\n   The deluge of crashes began about 1:30 p.m., and the pace slowed\ntwo hours later. But rescue crews worked frantically for hours\ntrying to pull apart the wreckage and treat the injured.\n\n   Here is a roundup of accidents in the metro area, culled from\ndispatchers' estimates and police reports as of 8 p.m. Sunday:\n\n   Jackson County, Mo., had at least 303 accidents. Kansas City had\nthe most, with 200 as of 5 p.m.; Independence had 70 accidents, one\nwith a serious injury.\n\n   Cass County, Mo., had 12 accidents. Most of them were minor, but\none accident on U.S. 71 South and Missouri 58 near Raymore had\nseven injuries.\n\n   Clay County, Mo., had five or six minor accidents.\n\n   In addition, the Missouri Highway Patrol handled about 60\naccidents between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. in Platte, Clay and Jackson\ncounties.\n\n   Johnson County, Kan., had 16 accidents, mostly fender benders.\n\n   Wyandotte County, Kan., had 14 accidents, none of them serious.\n\n   In addition, the Kansas Highway Patrol handled more than 26\naccidents in Johnson and Wyandotte counties.
