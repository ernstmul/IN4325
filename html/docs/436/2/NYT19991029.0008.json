CRONKLETON  \n c. 1999 Kansas City Star  \n\n   TOPEKA, Kan. _ An engineer who probably fell asleep caused a\nfatal collision between two Union Pacific trains near Topeka in\nJuly 1997, federal investigators have determined.\n\n   Officials also blamed the conductor, who left the engineer alone\nfor 20 minutes before the crash, and the railroad for not having an\neffective fatigue-awareness program.\n\n   Mark Davis, a Union Pacific spokesman, said Thursday that the\nrailroad brought in consultants and completely revamped its program\nafter the accident.\n\n   ``For us, that was a tragic time,'' he said. ``We had three\nfatal accidents in a three-month period.''\n\n   Seven persons died in those accidents in Devine, Texas; near\nTopeka; and in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n   Those accidents, Davis said, came in a year when the railroad's\noverall safety record had improved.\n\n   In safety recommendations released this month, the National\nTransportation Safety Board determined that the engineer probably\nfell asleep after his train entered a long siding to let the other\npass.\n\n   The two trains, carrying small amounts of hazardous materials,\ncollided at 2:15 a.m. July 2, 1997, a few miles north of Rossville,\nKan., about 15 miles northwest of Topeka.\n\n   Authorities evacuated about 1,000 residents of Rossville.\n\n   The engineer of one of the trains, Michael E. Brown, 46, of\nLenexa, was killed in the crash. Brown, according to the report, is\nthe one believed to have fallen asleep.\n\n   His conductor, Everett L. Starling of Topeka, received minor\ninjuries. The two crew members on the other train were not hurt.\n\n   Neither Brown's widow nor Starling could be reached for comment\nThursday.\n\n   Brown had been awake continuously for 18 hours at the time of\nthe accident. The safety board determined that the continuous hours\nwithout sleep together with the time of his work shift probably\naffected his behavior.\n\n   According to the safety board's report:\n\n   Brown awoke about 8 a.m. July 1, 1997, and did not nap before\nreporting for work at 8:30 p.m. This was his first day back after a\n17-day vacation, during which he went to sleep each evening between\n9 p.m. and midnight and awoke each morning between 5 a.m. and 7\na.m.\n\n   Brown, the safety board concluded, was not prepared to stay\nawake all night because he had firmly established a regular\nsleep-awake pattern.\n\n   Brown was the engineer for a westbound train from Kansas City to\nNorth Platte, Neb., with 85 cars, according to the railroad.\n\n   Twenty minutes before the accident, the conductor left the\nlocomotive's cab. About nine minutes before the collision, Brown's\ntrain entered the long siding.\n\n   The other train, eastbound with 42 cars and on its way from\nSeattle to Memphis, Tenn., approached at about 70 mph, the\nauthorized speed, according to the railroad.\n\n   When Brown did not dim his train's headlight, the other train's\ncrew responded by flashing its headlight and trying to contact him\nby radio.\n\n   Brown ``did not respond at all to repeated radio calls and did\nnot respond timely to the flashing headlight beam,'' the report\nsaid.\n\n   ``He possibly awoke upon hearing the eastbound train's horn\nsounding and dimmed his train lights in reaction to meeting an\noncoming train, but was either not sufficiently alert or too\nstartled or disoriented to realize that he needed to apply the\nbrakes.''\n\n   When Brown's train edged back onto the main line, its lead\nlocomotive hit the Seattle train six cars back of the engine.\n\n   The safety board also found fault with Starling's extended\nabsence from the cab, saying Starling did not properly perform his\nduties and provide the necessary safety oversight.\n\n   ``His interaction with the engineer may have provided the\nnecessary stimulus to keep him awake,'' the report said. ``At the\nvery least, an alert conductor probably would have detected that\nthe engineer was suffering from fatigue and could either have\nawakened him or taken actions to stop the train.''\n\n   The safety board also found that while the railroad has a\nfatigue-awareness program, some crew members and family had not\nheard of it. The board said this indicates that the program was not\neffective.\n\n   Davis, the Union Pacific spokesman, said the railroad's revamped\nprogram now complies with the recommendation that the railroad\nupdate its fatigue-awareness program, including documenting which\nemployees have received the training and annual reviews of the\nprogram.\n\n   The safety board also recommended that freight trains be\nequipped with devices that use satellites and technology to\nautomatically or remotely stop a locomotive to prevent accidents, a\nsystem called positive train separation.\n\n   On trains without these devices, the safety board recommended\nthat the railroad install devices that sound alarms periodically\nand require the engineer to perform some action to keep the train\nmoving.\n\n   Davis said the railroad has researched and tested the use of\npositive train separation systems but has found the technology\nneeds more development.
