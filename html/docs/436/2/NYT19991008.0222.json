Times News Service    \n\n   LONDON _ Moving with unusual speed after Britain's worst train\ncrash in decades, a government panel confirmed Friday that a\ncommuter train had caused the crash here by running a red signal\nlight straight into the path of a speeding intercity express.\n\n   Four days ago, police initially said that at least 70 people\ndied in the crash. But Friday they said that 30 fatalities had been\nconfirmed and that 64 people remained unaccounted for.\n\n   The accident on the approaches to Paddington Station horrified\nthe millions of Britons who commute by rail each day and fueled an\nemotional debate over safety three years after the state sold its\nrailroad system to private investors.\n\n   The preliminary government report from the Health and Safety\nExecutive found that the accident could have been avoided if the\ntrack operators had installed a special warning system at the\nnow-notorious signal 109 near Ladbroke Grove in western London, the\ncrash site.\n\n   Signal 109, known among rail engineers as difficult to see, had\nbeen due to be fitted with the warning system, but not until\nDecember 2003, the report said. The agency ordered Railtrack, the\ncompany that owns tracks, signals and stations, to upgrade the\nsignal before using it again.\n\n   The question of whether private companies have trimmed safety\nbudgets in their pursuit of profit goes to the core of a debate\nthat has consumed newspapers, television talk-shows and ordinary\nconversation since the crash.\n\n   The government report did little to comfort travelers abruptly\nconfronted with a sense that public safety comes second to profit\nin what Philip Stephens, a columnist in The Financial Times, called\n``a culture that has ceased to weigh carefully the public against\nthe individual interest.''\n\n   ``Britain has grown accustomed to public squalor,'' Stephens\nwrote. ``Until, that is, something like this happens.''\n\n   The report seemed just as damning. It said the Automatic Train\nProtection system, which is widely used in continental Europe, had\nbeen installed on the First Great Western intercity express that\nwas heading into London at 8:11 a.m., but was switched off because\nit was ``not operational.''\n\n   The equipment would not have prevented the crash, the report\nsaid, but should have been functioning. First Greater Western was\naccused of a similar lapse in an crash on that stretch two years\nago.\n\n   Since the accident, railroad executives have been accused of\nshying from the cost of installing special devices across the\nnetwork, saying that the devices are unreliable and expensive and\nthat they are quite likely to cost some $3.3 billion to install.\n\n   Instead, rail operators have begun to install the\ntechnologically different _ and cheaper _ Train Protection Warning\nSystem. Both systems are designed to brake trains automatically if\nthey run into danger.\n\n   Raising another safety question, the report said both trains\nwere carrying diesel fuel in tanks that apparently ruptured,\nspreading what rescuers have termed an inferno from the point of\nimpact. Even Friday, rescuers had still not searched through a\nfirst-class buffet car on the intercity express described by\nrescuers as being knee-deep in ash after a fireball incinerated it\nand the people inside.\n\n   Traditionally, official inquiries into rail accidents take\nmonths or even years to complete.
