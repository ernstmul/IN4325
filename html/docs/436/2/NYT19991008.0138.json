The\ntechnology is there.''\n\n   The grim task of recovering bodies from the charred wreckage of\nthe worst rail accident in Britain in more than half a century is\nnot yet complete. But for 2 million Britons who take the trains\nevery day, perhaps most disturbing is the realization that their\nlives have been judged not worth the expense of installing\nstate-of-the-art safety equipment.\n\n   Many f them agree with Jones. But others say that while the\nanger he voices is understandable, there is not an unlimited supply\nof money that can be pumped into safety devices. Besides, they\nargue, rail travel remains much safer than the roads, where an\naverage of 3,500 people die in accidents each year in Britain.\n\n   ``You're 15 times safer being in a train than in a car, and five\ntimes safer than being on a bus,'' said Lucy Twitchin, a\nspokeswoman for the Association of Train Operating Companies.\n\n   But Louise Christian, a lawyer for victims of a similar accident\njust a few miles west of Tuesday's crash, said it is inexcusable\nthat railroads have not put in the most sophisticated equipment\nwhen they know it can save lives.\n\n   As public outrage grows, there are indications that the\ngovernment, which has been trying to persuade more people to ride\ntrains, is changing its mind about the cost factor. John Prescott,\nthe deputy prime minister in charge of transportation, said\nThursday that if an inquiry into Tuesday's crash recommends\ninstallation of safety devices that the government and train\noperators rejected as too expensive, it will be done.\n\n   All this comes too late for at least 70 people known to have\ndied, and more than 150 who were injured, when a commuter train\napparently ran a red signal and veered into the path of an express\ncarrying 500 people two miles west of Paddington. The collision was\nnearly identical to the last major rail accident in Britain two\nyears ago, when seven people died in a collision at Southall, a few\nmiles west of Tuesday's disaster.\n\n   But unlike two years ago, ruptured fuel tanks erupted in flames\nTuesday, dramatically increasing the death toll. By Thursday night,\nauthorities had recovered only 30 bodies, and some 120 people\nremained unaccounted for. The recovery process is expected to take\nseveral more days.\n\n   Against this gruesome background, the debate over safety is\ngrowing daily. That this should happen in the country that\npioneered railways, and as the popularity of rail travel is\nincreasing, makes it an issue that goes right to the national\nconsciousness.\n\n   Sir Anthony Hidden, the lawyer who led the investigation into a\ncollision at Clapham in which 35 people were killed, recommended in\n1989 that all trains be fitted with Automatic Train Protection, or\nATP, systems, which automatically apply the brakes when a driver\nignores a red signal light, as happened at Clapham, Southall and,\napparently, on Tuesday. But the more than $1 billion cost to\ninstall that system was rejected by train operators and the\ngovernment as too expensive.\n\n   Before Tuesday's accident, the industry had calculated, based on\nthe average number of rail passenger deaths in recent years, that\ninstalling the ATP system would cost $23 million per life saved,\nand that it couldn't justify spending more than $3.25 million per\nlife. Since Tuesday, that kind of calculation, routine in\ncost-effectiveness analysis, has sent a collective chill down the\nspines of many Britons.\n\n   Two months ago, Prescott said an alternative Train Protection\nand Warning System designed to prevent collisions would be\ninstalled nationwide by 2004. Its advocates say it provides 70\npercent of the protection of the ATP system at 20 percent of the\ncost. But Christian and other critics say it is not as reliable.\n\n   In the three years since Britain's 20,000 miles of railway were\nprivatized, ridership has increased 20 percent. But so have delays,\novercrowding, and passenger complaints. Critics say privatization\nhas created a fragmented system in which a comprehensive approach\nto anything, including safety, is more difficult than in countries\nwhere rail systems remain under state control.\n\n   While everything used to fall under British Rail, privatization\nhas seen the rail system carved up into 100 components. The tracks\nare owned and managed by Railtrack. There are three rolling stock\ncompanies that lease locomotives and passenger cars, five freight\nservices, seven maintenance companies, 25 companies that operate\npassenger services, and dozens of subcontractors.\n\n   Critics say the system, by which most of the 25 passenger\ncarriers hold the rights to a line for seven years, does not give\ncompanies enough incentive to invest in safety.\n\n   Since privatization, Railtrack and passenger carriers have\nposted healthy profits. But too many of the profits have been going\nto stockholders, not back into the system, critics say.\n\n   ``Privatized railway companies make huge profits,'' Christian\nsaid.\n\n   But while Railtrack is pulling in profits of more than $1.5\nmillion a day, Lesia Kozlowsky, a Railtrack spokeswoman, said much\nof that profit is being put into the infrastructure. She said the\ncompany will spend $45 billion over the next 10 years on\nmaintenance and improving tracks and signaling.\n\n   Bridget Hutter, a professor at the London School of Economics\nwho has studied the railway industry, takes more than a\nprofessional interest in the debate.
