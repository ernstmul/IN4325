Seeing the bus continue across the tracks, he jammed the\nlocomotive into an emergency stop, said Trooper Ken Uselton of the\nTennesee Highway Patrol.\n\n   Joe Brown, whose home abuts the railroad, heard a ``boom'' that\nsounded like dynamite exploding. One of the first to arrive on the\nscene, Brown saw the train had dragged the bus more than 200 feet,\nfrom Tennessee into Georgia.\n\n   The collision wrenched the bus' upper shell from its chassis and\nengine.\n\n   Worse, said Brown, ``There were little kids lying everywhere.''\n\n   He went over to one girl lying still on the ground. She was\ndead. Other children were injured and crying. He knelt by one and\nsaid, ``You'll be all right.''\n\n   As ambulances arrived, Brown helped lift children onto\nstretchers.\n\n   ``Everybody was going crazy,'' he said, standing by the ravaged\nhulk of the bus. ``If you could help, you helped.'' Daniel Pack, 9,\nof Tennga and 6-year-old Kayla Silvers of Cisco died at the scene.\n\n   Kevin J. Sherrill, 8, and Amber Pritchett, 9, both of Tennga,\nwere in critical condition Tuesday night. So, too, was Kayli Cloer,\n5, whose mother, the bus driver, was listed in fair condition. The\nCloers live in Chatsworth.\n\n   Brittany Gaddis, 8, and Jordan Manis, 6, both of Tennga, were\nlisted in serious condition.\n\n   All the injured were taken to Erlanger Medical Center in\nChattanooga, Tenn.\n\n   Jimmy Sluder, Daniel Pack's stepfather, said he heard about the\ncrash while listening to the radio at work.\n\n   ``I knew he was on the bus, but I didn't know if he was hurt,''\nsaid Sluder. Later, he had to identify the body of the boy, who had\nenjoyed horses and bicycles.\n\n   ``I'm in shock, I guess,'' he said. ``You really don't know how\nto feel.''\n\n   Darrell Silvers first saw the boy, his neighbor, was dead at the\nscene. He then saw his daughter Kayla inside the shattered shell of\nthe bus.\n\n   ``I pulled her out,'' Silvers said. His little girl was dead.\n\n   The National Transportation Safety Board said the bus had\ncrossed into Tennessee, made a loop and headed back to Georgia when\nit was hit by the train.\n\n   Trains are allowed to travel 60 mph at that spot; the engineer\nwas able to slow only to 50 before the collision.\n\n   Trains are a part of life in this border community, rumbling\nthrough at all hours, blowing their whistles. Some residents said\nthe crossing at Liberty Church Road, which has no signal lights or\nmechanical crossing arms, was a tragedy waiting to happen.\n\n   Herman Stinnett, 49, said motorists often can't see the train\ncoming because of tall, dense foliage along the tracks. It's too\nearly in the investigation to assign blame, authorities said late\nTuesday. They need to reconstruct the accident and interview the\nengineer, the bus driver and others.\n\n   Rhonda Cloer applied for her bus driver's license in July 1991.\nThe Murray County school system granted the license a month later.\n\n   Cloer became a full-time school bus driver a year ago. She was a\nsubstitute driver during the previous two years. She holds a valid\ncommercial bus driver's license and carries all proper endorsements\nto drive a school bus, said Jim Shuler, spokesman for the Georgia\nDepartment of Public Safety.\n\n   Cloer also took a train safety workshop within the last two\nmonths. The Bus Driver Training Institute seminar taught drivers\nhow to approach railroad crossings, Shuler said.\n\n   Cloer had had no accidents within the past two years, according\nto records available Tuesday.\n\n   Tennessee Department of Safety officials said it was ``way too\nearly'' to consider any possible charges against the bus driver. A\nroutine blood-alcohol test was performed on Cloer and the train's\nengineer.\n\n   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions right now,'' said Dana\nKeeton, a Department of Safety spokeswoman.\n\n   Tuesday wasn't the first time for tragedy on the train tracks\nnear Tennga.\n\n   Nearly two years ago, 15 miles up the tracks, a CSX freight\nslammed into a van carrying a Polk County, Tenn., family. The\nparents and three young children were crushed. A witness described\nthe van as ``crushed into a box.''\n\n   It is rare in Georgia for a child to be killed while riding a\nschool bus.
