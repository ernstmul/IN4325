Times News Service    \n\n   LONDON _ The death toll from Tuesday's train crash in London,\nBritain's worst in more than four decades, rose to at least 70 on\nWednesday, police said. An intercity express hit a three-car\ncommuter train that apparently ran a red light, investigators\nreported.\n\n   The fate of 100 more people remained unclear, according to a\npolice spokesman, Andy Trotter.\n\n   And the crash rekindled a passionate debate over the safety of\nBritain's trains since the formerly state-owned system was sold in\nMay 1996 to private companies, which have been accused by union\nofficials of skimping on safety equipment in their pursuit of\nprofit.\n\n   In a rending twist for relatives of the dead, rescue officials\nsaid the remains of many bodies are still not recovered,\nincinerated in the burned shell of a first-class buffet car at the\nfront of the express.\n\n   One official described the 48-seat carriage as ``knee-deep in\nash'' from a devastating fire that erupted almost immediately after\nthe express, heading into London from western England with 500\ntravelers, hit the smaller train, which was heading out of London\nat 8:11 a.m., the height of the morning rush-hour.\n\n   Some of the dead may never be identified or even recovered,\nTrotter said. ``We do not believe, given the devastation caused by\nthe fire, that it will be possible to recover any more bodies from\nthe train,'' he added.\n\n   The stricken carriage, which has not yet been searched, lay\nlopsidedly along the track Wednesday night, covered in drab gray\ntarpaulins. Rescue officials said they may begin a detailed search\non Thursday.\n\n   Tony Thompson, an officer of the British Transport Police, said\nthat both trains were carrying diesel fuel and that when they\ncollided, ``it was a fireball.''\n\n   ``All the seats are gone, everything is gone,'' Thompson said.\n``It's just a shell.''\n\n   One survivor, Brendon Bentley, a 24-year-old New Zealander who\nworks as an accountant, was on the commuter train.\n\n   ``I remember just a big surge and everyone being knocked down\nand then bits of seat and everything coming from over my shoulders\nand then just darkness,'' he said from his bed at St. Mary's\nHospital, where he is being treated for damage to his spleen and a\nbroken wrist.\n\n   When the fire began, he said, `'I could see the flames and there\nwere some people trapped underneath the seats.
