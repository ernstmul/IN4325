Times News Service   \n\n   HOUSTON _ Six people believed to be illegal immigrants from\nMexico were hit and killed early Monday by a freight train as they\nslept on a desolate stretch of tracks in southern Texas. Officials\nsaid they believed the immigrants may have been victims of a\nsuperstition that the rails would keep them safe from snakes.\n\n   ``There's a myth that if you sleep between the rails that snakes\nwill not get you,'' said Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific.\n``You go down the railroad tracks, you'll see snakes cut in half.''\n\n   Davis said the driver of the train blew the whistle repeatedly\nwhen he noticed the people on the tracks. Although a couple of the\nvictims raised their heads, no one got off the tracks. Davis said\nhe was uncertain how far the train was from the victims when the\ndriver saw them. But, he added, it would have taken a mile to stop\nthe 105-car train, which was traveling between 45 and 49 miles an\nhour.\n\n   The vast ranchlands of South Texas that stretch between the Rio\nGrande and San Antonio are among the most remote in the state, mile\nafter mile of mesquite, prickly pear, citrus farms and grazing\nlands that are a prime avenue for illegal immigrants trying to make\ntheir way from the Mexican border to San Antonio or Houston.\n\n   While illegal immigrants have been killed while sleeping on\nrailroad tracks before, Fred Borrego, patrol agent in charge of the\nU.S. Border Patrol in Kingsville, said never had so many been\nkilled in one accident. Between 2,000 and 3,000 illegal immigrants\npass through his 2,600-square-mile patrol area each month, he said.\n\n   The most recent victims, who were badly mutilated, have not been\nidentified. They were taken to Corpus Christi where authorities\nwill try to use fingerprints to determine their identity.\n\n   Borrego had another possible explanation for the accident.\n\n   ``Another theory I've been told is that in Mexico the trains\ndon't run at night,'' Borrego said. ``They say they sleep up there\nbecause they feel a lot safer.''\n\n   Although it seems implausible that people could sleep with the\nnoise of a train running toward them, Davis said, ``a train\noperating when you're in front of it is very, very quiet.''\n\n   The engine noise is primarily to the side, he said, and there is\nvery little friction on the rail itself.\n\n   ``I know its hard to believe,'' Borrego said. ``I've experienced\nthis myself. If it's coming toward you it's as quiet as a cat.''\n\n   But officials in the Kenedy County sheriff's office speculated\nthat the hard traveling conditions confronted by the immigrants\ncould also have played a role. The terrain in the area is very\nrugged, with most of it being brush covered.\n\n   ``You think, `I'd never fall asleep there' or `Why wouldn't they\nwake up?''' said Hopy Alines, a secretary in the sheriff's office.\n``But it just doesn't happen. These people travel three, four and\nfive days without eating, without sleeping. They're just completely\nexhausted and they don't wake up.''\n\n   Generally the illegal immigrants traveling through the county go\nunnoticed aside from the trail of odds and ends they leave behind,\nMs. Alines said. ``You'll see empty bottles, sometimes bags of\nclothes,'' she said. ``We get a lot of calls where they break in\nand all they ever take is food and water.'' It is generally when\npeople get sick or have problems that officials hear stories like\nthe ones about people sleeping on the tracks.\n\n   Davis estimated that four to six people a year are injured or\nkilled while sleeping on railroad tracks. In fact, he said, there\nhave been cases where people sleeping on tracks have been run over\nand survived.\n\n   ``Unfortunately, or fortunately, they're intoxicated,'' he said.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   The train, which was carrying a variety of freight like scrap\npaper and metal automobile parts, was traveling from Houston to\nBrownsville, Texas, when the accident occurred about 3:15 a.m. near\nthe tiny town of Norias, which is 60 miles north of Brownsville.\n\n   Last year in Texas there were 38 fatalities and 80 injuries\ninvolving what railroad officials call ``trespass accidents,''\nDavis said, cases where people were struck on or near tracks or\ntrying to get on a railroad car.\n\n   Borrego said the last time he could remember a large group of\nillegal immigrants being killed on train tracks was in 1983 or 1984\nwhen 14 people were killed trying to cross a railroad trestle.\n\n   Border Patrol officials along with Union Pacific officials\ncaution illegal immigrants about sleeping on railroad tracks as\npart of general information they provide on the dangers of crossing\nthe border.\n\n   ``Sometimes they don't get the word,'' Borrego said. ``The\nconditions out here are rigid.
