Times News Service    \n\n   PORTAGE, Ind. _ Three people were killed and five others injured\nThursday morning when a Chicago-bound commuter train struck a\ntractor-trailer truck that had been stuck at a crossing.\n\n   According to investigators, the truck, which was delivering\nthree 40,000-pound steel coils, had crossed the commuter tracks as\nit entered a steel mill in Portage, 30 miles southeast of Chicago.\nHowever, a freight train running on tracks parallel to the South\nShore Railroad train had tripped its crossing gates and trapped the\ntail end of the double-wide truck between the two tracks.\n\n   While it was stopped at the crossing waiting for the freight\ntrain to clear, authorities said, the commuter train approached and\nslammed into the overlapping trailer, dragging it close to 400\nfeet. The impact launched one of the steel coils into the front car\nof the train, killing three of the passengers, William McCombs of\nLaporte, Ind., Gary Berndt of Michigan City, ind., and Glenn Walker\nof Baroda, Mich., an off-duty employee of the railroad. The five\nother passengers received minor injuries. The truck driver was not\nseriously hurt.\n\n   The two-car train, which originated in Michigan City, Ind., was\nthe first of 10 morning trains carrying people to Chicago. The\ncollision occurred at 4:35 a.m., stopping service on the line that\nshuttles between South Bend, Ind., and Chicago.\n\n   According to Dave Eggers, a trooper with the Indiana State\nPolice, the driver of the truck, Keith Lintz of Niles, Mich., was\ncited for several violations. The most serious of the citations was\nan overweight violation, since Lintz did not have the proper permit\nrequired to carry such a heavy load.\n\n   Eggers declined to say that any of the violations contributed to\nthe collision.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board were\non the scene leading the investigation. Michael Martino, the\ninvestigator in charge, said they planned to recreate the crash\nSaturday, by which time they would have a better idea of what\nhappened.\n\n   According to a spokesman for the Northern Indiana Commuter\nTransportation District, which owns and operates the South Shore\nline, where the collision occurred, the engineer saw the truck and\napplied the emergency brake. ``He then left the cab and tried to\nwarn people in the front car, but he only had a matter of\nseconds,'' said the spokesman, John Parsons. He added the train was\ntraveling about 45 miles per hour, well below the normal speed,\nlimit because a portion of the line that merges down to one track\nwas approaching. He said about 20 passengers were aboard the train,\nwhich had made only three stops before the collision.\n\n   (Train passengers were also injured in two other collisions\nThursday. In Durham, N.C., an Amtrak train heading for New York\nwith about 200 on board hit a tractor-trailer at a downtown\ncrossing, critically injuring the truck driver and slightly\ninjuring two in the train crew.
