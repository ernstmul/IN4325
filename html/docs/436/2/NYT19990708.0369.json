MILLING\n      c.1999 Houston Chronicle\n\n   EAGLE LAKE, Texas _ An Amtrak train carrying 234 passengers hit\na tanker truck at a rural crossing Thursday and derailed, injuring\n18 people, including the engineer and his assistant.\n\n   The truck, which was hauling a saltwater disposal tank, crossed\nthe tracks in front of the eastbound Sunset Limited just before\nnoon near Eagle Lake, about 65 miles west of Houston.\n\n   Two locomotives and seven of the train's 10 cars jumped the\ntracks, with the engine landing on its side perpendicular to the\ntracks. The train, en route from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., had\nstopped in San Antonio and was heading toward its next stop in\nHouston.\n\n   There were no warning lights or crossing gates at the crossing,\nwhich was on a short dirt road leading from a rice field onto U.S.\n90A.\n\n   The truck driver, Jason David Bubela, 21, of El Campo, was not\nseriously injured, police said. Police said they are considering\npossible charges against the driver. The truck, which police say\nmay have had bad brakes, is owned by Key Energy Services of\nBryan-College Station, which is conducting its own investigation.\n\n   ``Unfortunately, these crossing accidents happen all too\noften,'' Amtrak spokesman Derrick James said. ``People just don't\nseem to want to wait.''  \n\n     Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, owners of the track,\nsaid an accident occurred at the same crossing three weeks ago when\nan empty freight train clipped the back of a grain truck. The\nwreck, however, was termed minor.  \n\n     Vernon Stevenson, 32, of Eagle Lake, was using a portable\nrestroom near the tracks when the accident happened.\n\n   ``I was coming out, and I heard all this commotion,'' said\nStevenson, who works at Rice Industries, behind the Colorado County\nRice Mill. ``The train just went up and went to flipping like. It\nwas like an explosion. It scared me so bad. I took off running.''\n\n   ``I was thinking that engine was coming into my car,'' said\nTommy Stewart, the train's head conductor, who was two cars behind\nthe engine. ``Nobody in my car was bleeding, and everybody could\nwalk, so I jumped out and saw my engineer on the ground.''\n\n   He said the assistant engineer was trapped ``and he had a big\ngash in his head. He was talking to me, though.''\n\n   Crew members and rescuers used a sledgehammer to break a window\nand pulled out the assistant engineer, Ed Guidon. He and engineer\nJ.D. Wood were in stable condition Thursday evening at Rice Medical\nCenter in Eagle Lake.      Their hometowns were not immediately known   .\n\n     Sixteen other passengers and crew members were treated for\nbruises, cuts and heat exhaustion from standing in the 90-degree\nheat awaiting transportation into Eagle Lake, about five miles\naway.\n\n   Stewart, who spent the afternoon at the wreck site after a short\ntrip to the hospital to get his elbow X-rayed, said he planned to\ncheck on his passengers at a makeshift shelter at the local\ncommunity center before heading home to Columbus.\n\n   ``Then,'' he said, ``I might go buy a bottle of whiskey. We were\nvery lucky.''\n\n   Among the passengers were Cindy and Jack McCain, the wife and\n13-year-old son of presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John\nMcCain, who were on their way to Florida on vacation. Authorities\nsaid neither was hurt. They took a private plane to Florida a few\nhours after the accident.\n\n   Other passengers were taken in school buses to the Eagle Lake\nCommunity Center, where volunteers set up a first-aid station and\nserved barbecue and pizza donated by local restaurants. The\npassengers later were bused to Houston, where Amtrak officials\nplanned to reunite them with their luggage and arrange other\ntransportation.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE)\n\n   The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in\nAmtrak's 28-year history.
