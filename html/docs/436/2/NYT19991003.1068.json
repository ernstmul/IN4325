Times News Service   \n\n   LONDON _ Two commuter trains slammed into each other and burst\ninto flames during the morning rush hour on Tuesday, killing at\nleast 26 people and severely injuring scores more on the same\nsection of track in West London where an alarmingly similar crash\noccurred two years ago.\n\n   The grisly floodlit search for victims was suspended on Tuesday\nnight to await the arrival, in the morning, of heavy suspension\nequipment to lift a blackened and mangled front car that it was\nfeared would reveal a number of others crushed to death.\n\n   Superintendent Tony Thompson of the British Transport Police\nsaid, ``The seating capacity of a carriage like that would probably\nbe around 60 people, but it's difficult to say how many people may\nhave been in the carriage.''\n\n   Overcoats, attache cases, overnight bags and plastic coffee cups\nlittered the tracks where rescue workers struggled through the day\nin the twisted and smoking metal to free trapped riders.

Paddington Station is London's gateway to Western England and\nWales and the terminus for the new high-speed rail link to Heathrow\ninternational airport.\n\n   An amateur cameraman captured the scene in the immediate\naftermath as a plume of grey smoke billowed and rolled into the\nsky. Survivors were seen crawling out of broken windows and making\ntheir dazed passage along the sides of the overturned railway cars.\nA group of men who had escaped braved flames to help others still\ntrapped inside. Terrified cries and shouts of ``help'' and ``help\nme'' could be heard on the soundtrack.\n\n   Staff from a nearby Sainsbury's supermarket put ladders down to\nthe open tracks and rushed to wrest people from the burning\nwreckage.\n\n   Joe Bannerman, 40, a cleaning supervisor, said: ``I couldn't\nbelieve the scene, I could see people with blood pouring down their\nfaces. Someone was running with their clothes on fire. I could see\nlots of people were burned badly on their faces and hands. I could\nsee one dead body. Some other passengers pulled him out and covered\nhis face.''\n\n   In all, 154 people were treated at hospitals during the day,\nwith 14 still in intensive care units on Tuesday night and another\n54 in general wards. Dr. Robin Touquet at St. Mary's Hospital said\nthat a number of victims had ``horrific burns, the kind you\nassociate more with World War II than a train crash.''
