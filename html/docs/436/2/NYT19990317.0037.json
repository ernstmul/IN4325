Times News Service   \n\n   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,\ncomfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car\nof a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had\nboarded in Chicago, just two hours before, and their train, its\nlegend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull\ninto New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day.\n\n   But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:47\np.m. on Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a\nsemi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about\n55 miles south of Chicago.\n\n   By Tuesday afternoon, 13 passengers had been found dead, most of\nthem in the sleeper car. Some people were still unaccounted for,\nand officials said on Tuesday night that the number was either\nthree or four. There were no signs that those people were alive.\n\n   The first five cars of the train were mangled, twisted like\nempty soda cans after the train hit the back of the truck and\nderailed. Flames burst out, visible from miles away.\n\n   ``I'm not sure at this point I can collect my thoughts enough to\ntell you what was going through my mind,'' said Michael\nHarshbarger, chief of the tiny Bourbonnais fire department. ``I\ndon't think I've ever seen anything quite like that.''\n\n   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of\ninvestigating the crash, said on Tuesday night that in preliminary\ninterviews, the train engineer said he saw the truck go around the\nclosed gates at the crossing. Investigators also said the truck\ndriver told a different story, saying the gates started to close\nafter he was in the crossing. A safety board official, John Goglia,\nsaid investigators were particularly interested in a set of tire\ntracks. If the tracks match the truck's tires, he said, they would\nindicate that the truck did try to go around the closed gate.\n\n   Officials were releasing no details about the dead, whose bodies\nwere being kept in an old lumber company warehouse turned makeshift\nmorgue. But a woman in Nesbit, Miss., confirmed that four of those\nkilled _ a woman, her granddaughter and two other children _ were\nreturning home to Nesbit after a shopping trip to Chicago.\n\n   There were 116 people injured, federal investigators said, with\n49 of them still hospitalized on Tuesday night. All the survivors\nwere rescued Monday night, among them a group of 20 teen-agers from\nMississippi and their chaperones, returning from a ski trip to\nCanada.\n\n   The train was carrying 196 passengers, 19 Amtrak employees and 2\nemployees of the Illinois Central Railroad, which manages the\nrailroad crossing.\n\n   The truck driver, who was using a probationary permit after his\nlicense had been suspended because of speeding tickts, was heading\neast across the train tracks when the train hit. The collision\nshattered the trailer section of the truck, which was packed with\nheavy steel bars from a nearby steel factory. The driver was\ntreated and released, officials said.\n\n   The safety board said on Tuesday night that the train had been\ntraveling at 79 miles an hour, the maximum allowed on this stretch\nof track. The train was blowing its whistle and had engaged its\nemergency brake, Goglia said.\n\n   At the end of the day on Tuesday, rescue crews that had rushed\nhere from miles away continued to comb through the tangled metal,\nhampered by piles of crushed debris and the need to make sure the\nwreckage would not shift and endanger the rescuers themselves.\n\n   The once-gleaming sleeper car had been slammed up onto one of\nthe train's two locomotives. It was broken down the middle and\nravaged by fire, Harshbarger said.\n\n   ``The interior is filled with debris from the fire, and it's\nnecessary to search through that debris to find victims,''\nHarshbarger said. ``It's simply a matter of digging with the gloved\nhand, turning pieces of debris over in order to find someone.''\n\n   Don Allen, 80, who was traveling with his wife from their home\nin Winona, Minn., to visit their son in Florida, described the\nfrightening confusion of the accident.\n\n   ``There was this violent jerking motion and all of a sudden we\njust stopped and the lights went out,'' said Allen, who was riding\nin one of the last of the train's 14 cars and had just settled down\nto read a book. He heard a loud, grating noise and then, he said,\n``All we could see was the smoke.''\n\n   The crash was the third-deadliest accident in Amtrak's 26-year\nhistory. The worst was a 1993 crash that killed 47 people when a\ntrain plunged into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. In 1987, two trains\ncollided near Chase, Md., killing 16.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE.

Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., a town a\nfew miles north of here, had had his commercial driver's license\nsuspended in January because he had received three speeding tickets\nin 12 months, said David Druker, a spokesman for the Illinois\nsecretary of state's office.\n\n   But because it was Stokes' first suspension he was allowed to\ntake a safety class and receive a temporary probationary permit.\nBarring any problems, he would have got his regular license back on\nMarch 25.
