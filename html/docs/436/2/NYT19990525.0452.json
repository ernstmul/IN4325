Times News Service  \n\n   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ A woman and three of her four young sons were\nkilled early Tuesday morning when they were hit by an Amtrak train\nas the woman crossed the tracks in a last-second attempt to rescue\none of the children from the locomotive's path, the State Police\nsaid.\n\n   One of the boys who was struck survived, but remained\nunconscious and was in gravely critical condition at Bridgeport\nHospital Tuesday night after surgery to repair a deep head wound\nand several bone fractures, hospital officials said. The boy, whom\npolice identified as Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6, also\nunderwent emergency surgery to amputate what remained of his left\nleg.\n\n   Late Tuesday, police investigators were still trying to\ndetermine why the woman, an Ecuadorean immigrant in in her 40s, was\nwalking with her four sons along a series of four parallel train\ntracks about 2:20 a.m. The woman and the boys, ages 3, 6, 10 and\n12, had been living for the past week at Families-In-Transition, an\nemergency shelter operated by the YMCA in Bridgeport, police said.\n\n   At a news conference, Chief James O'Donnell of the Connecticut\nState Police said investigators would not be able to identify the\nvictims until the bodies are examined by state's medical rxaminer's\noffice.\n\n   The woman's husband, identified by the Ecuadorean Consulate in\nNew York City as Carlos Urgiles, had returned to Ecuador more than\na year ago.\n\n   O'Donnell offered a rough explanation of how the woman and her\nfour sons were struck by the electrically powered train, an Amtrak\nTwilight Shoreliner carrying 210 people between Boston and Newport\nNews, Va.\n\n   He said the woman and three of her four sons were walking on one\nside of Track 3, the northernmost of the four tracks just west of\nFairfield's rail station. A fourth boy was apparently walking on\nthe other side of Track 3, the police said, when the train\napproached and the locomotive's engineer pulled on the horn and\nengaged the emergency brake.\n\n   According to police interviews with the engineer, a 20-year\nveteran operator for Amtrak and Conrail, the woman heard the\ntrain's horn and, her three other children in tow, tried to run\nover Track 3 to retrieve her fourth child. The child ran toward her\nonto Track 3. The train struck all five family members as they\nhuddled on the track, O'Donnell said.\n\n   Amtrak officials did not know how fast the train was moving at\nthe time of the crash, but said locomotives are allowed a top speed\nof 70 miles per hour. At that speed, a train takes from one to two\nmiles to grind to a halt, even with the emergency brake employed.\n``There was nothing, absolutely nothing, the engineer could have\ndone,'' said Kenneth J. Gambardella, an investigator with the\nConnecticut Department of Transportation.\n\n   The engineer was so distraught after the accident that\nparamedics took him to Bridgeport Hospital, along with the train's\nconductor, to be treated for shock. Both men were later released,\npolice said.   \n","Headline":"\nWOMAN AND 3 CHILDREN ARE KILLED BY AN AMTRAK TRAIN \n","Text":["\n   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ A woman and three of her four young sons were\nkilled early Tuesday morning when they were hit by an Amtrak train\nas the woman crossed the tracks in a last-second attempt to rescue\none of the children from the locomotive's path, the State Police\nsaid.\n","\n   One of the boys who was struck survived, but remained\nunconscious and was in gravely critical condition at Bridgeport\nHospital Tuesday night after surgery to repair a deep head wound\nand several bone fractures, hospital officials said.
