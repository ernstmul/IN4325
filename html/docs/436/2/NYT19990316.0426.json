Times News Service   \n\n   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,\ncomfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car\nof a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had\nboarded in Chicago, just two hours before, and their train, its\nlegend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull\ninto New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day.\n\n   But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:55\np.m. CT Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a\nsemi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about\n55 miles south of Chicago.\n\n   By Tuesday afternoon, at least 13 passengers had been found\ndead, all of them in the sleeper car. Local fire officials said\nTuesday night that four people were unaccounted for, but Amtrak\nofficials and federal investigators declined to say how many they\nthought were missing. There were no signs that any of those\nunaccounted for were alive.\n\n   In what was being called one of the worst accidents in Amtrak's\nhistory, the train derailed and the first five cars were mangled,\ntwisted like empty soda cans. Flames burst out, visible from miles\naway.\n\n   ``I'm not sure at this point I can collect my thoughts enough to\ntell you what was going through my mind,'' said Michael\nHarshbarger, chief of the tiny Bourbonnais fire department. ``I\ndon't think I've ever seen anything quite like that.''\n\n   Officials were releasing no details about the dead, whose bodies\nwere being kept in an old lumber company warehouse turned makeshift\nmorgue. But a woman in Nesbit, Miss., confirmed that four of those\nkilled were from Nesbit _ a woman, her grandchild and two other\nchildren.\n\n   The grandmother, June Bonnin, was a cancer survivor in her late\n40s who had opened a bed and breakfast with her husband while she\nwas still recovering. She was traveling with her granddaughter,\nJessica Whitaker, 12, two of the girl's friends and her daughter,\nso that the girls could shop in Chicago at a store that carried\nAmerican Girl dolls and their accessories, which feature historic\ndetails. The daughter, Ashley Bonnin, who is Jessica's aunt, was\ninjured in the crash and hospitalized in Kankakee, a few miles\nsouth of here.\n\n   Ashley Bonnin was among 114 people who were injured, at least 11\ncritically, authorities said. They were rescued along with the rest\nof the train's surviving 216 passengers and crew members. Among\nthose passengers was a group of 20 teen-agers from Mississippi and\ntheir chaperones, returning from a ski trip to Canada.\n\n   The truck driver, who was driving on a probationary permit after\nhis license had been suspended because of speeding tickets, was\nheading east across the train tracks when the train hit. His truck\nwas packed with heavy steel bars from a nearby steel factory. He\nwas routinely treated and released, officials said. The collision\nshattered the trailer section of the truck.\n\n   At the end of the day Tuesday, rescue crews that had rushed here\nfrom miles away were still combing through the tangled metal,\nhampered by piles of crushed debris and the need to make sure the\nwreckage would not shift and endanger the rescuers themselves.\n\n   The once-gleaming sleeper car had been slammed up onto one of\nthe train's two locomotives. It was broken down the middle and\nravaged by fire, Harshbarger said.\n\n   ``The interior is filled with debris from the fire, and it's\nnecessary to search through that debris to find victims,''\nHarshbarger said. ``It's simply a matter of digging with the gloved\nhand, turning pieces of debris over in order to find someone.''\n\n   Don Allen, 80, who was traveling with his wife from their home\nin Winona, Minn., to visit their son in Florida, described the\nfrightening confusion of the accident.\n\n   ``There was this violent jerking motion and all of a sudden we\njust stopped and the lights went out,'' said Allen, who was riding\nin one of the last of the train's 14 cars and had just settled down\nto read a book. He heard a loud, grating noise and then, he said,\n``All we could see was the smoke.''\n\n   The crash was one of the deadliest in Amtrak's 26-year history.\nThe worst was a 1993 crash that killed 47 people when a train\nplunged into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. In 1987, two trains collided\nnear Chase, Md., killing 16.\n\n   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board\narrived Tuesday morning. In addition to investigating the accident,\nthe board will coordinate efforts to help the families of the dead\nand injured, as it does after plane crashes.\n\n   The truck driver, John Ralph Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., a\ntown near the accident site, had had his commercial driver's\nlicense suspended in January because he had received three speeding\ntickets in 12 months, said David Druker, a spokesman for the\nIllinois secretary of state's office.\n\n   However, since this was Stokes' first suspension, he was able to\ntake a safety class and receive a temporary probationary permit.\nBarring any problems, he would have received his regular license\nback on March 25.\n\n   ``The man was driving legally,'' Druker said.\n\n   Kenneth Wykle, the administrator of the Federal Highway\nAdministration, said the agency would investigate the\nsafety-compliance record of the company Stokes was driving for,\nMelco Transfer Inc. of Peotone, Ill.\n\n   No one answered the door or the telephone at Stokes' house on\nTuesday.\n\n   Earlier Tuesday, Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National\nTransportation Safety Board, told The Associated Press that Stokes\nhad told authorities that he did not see the train or warning\nlights until he had already started driving across the tracks.\nLater Tuesday afternoon, safety board officials would not confirm\nthat account.\n\n   Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, held a press\nconference Tuesday to say that he had been briefed on the\ninvestigation and believed that the truck driver was trying to beat\nthe train by driving around the crossing gates.\n\n   ``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the\nbarriers down, and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around\nit,'' Thompson said.\n\n   nn\n\n   A spokesman for Illinois Central Railroad, which manages the\nrailroad crossing, said the crossing was equipped with gates, two\nsignal lights and a bell, which were functioning properly Monday\nnight, based on an analysis of a computer chip that records the\nprevious 3,000 times the crossing equipment functions.\n\n   ``We have every confidence that they were working last night,''\nsaid the spokesman, Jack Burke. He said the blinking lights begin\nto flash five seconds before the gates come down, and that the\ngates start to come down about 26 seconds before the train gets to\nthe crossing. He said it would not have been possible for the truck\nto get trapped by the closing gates, because the gates would have\nhit the truck and broken.\n\n   There have been three previous fatal accidents at this railroad\ncrossing, in 1964, 1968 and 1988. State officials say that is a\nrelatively good safety record, given the number of trains that\ncross the intersection _ about 40 a day, traveling at speeds\nbetween 25 and 79 mph.\n\n   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Railroad\nAdministration, said Tuesday that the crossing was considered a\ngood intersection. The agency's records indicate that the road\ncrossing the tracks is angled to give drivers a clear view of\noncoming trains.\n\n   A City of New Orleans train passes this way every night, pulling\nout of Chicago at about 8 p.m. It makes a few stops in Illinois,\nstops in Memphis, Tenn., and virtually turns into a local train in\nMississippi, until it reaches New Orleans at 3:30 p.m. the\nfollowing day. Another City of New Orleans train makes the same\ntrip in reverse every day.\n\n   The City of New Orleans was the main northbound train of the\ngreat black migration from the South in the 1940s and 1950s. And it\nwas celebrated in a folk song written by Steve Goodman and made\nfamous by Arlo Guthrie. The song croons about men dealing cards in\nthe club car, mothers rocking their sleeping babies and the train\n``passin' towns that have no names, freight yards full of old black\nmen, and the graveyards of rusted automobiles.''\n\n   The chorus _ ``Good Morning America, how are you?'' _\nmemorialized the romance of the railroad age.\n\n   The modern-day City of New Orleans is a comfortable ride,\nespecially in the sleeping car, where passengers have a\n``hospitality hour,'' a morning paper delivered to them, and a\n24-hour on-call attendant who can ``order you a night-cap if\nwished,'' Amtrak's literature says.\n\n   National Transportation Safety Board officials said they had\ninterviewed the truck driver and the train engineer and sent the\ntrain's black box to Chicago to be analyzed. They plan to retest\nthe crossing gates and lights and the sensor on the tracks that\ntrips the gates.\n\n   They said the investigation was complicated by the presence of\ntwo cars on the side tracks, one full of steel and the other full\nof furnace residue from a steel plant. The cars had been struck in\nthe derailment and were making the search for evidence more\ndifficult.\n\n   Also, for the first time in a railroad accident, the safety\nboard deployed a counseling team to work with the survivors, an\napproach adopted after a fatal airline crash in 1996.\n\n   Meanwhile, in a stiff winter wind, rescue workers clambered on\ntop of the up-ended and fractured train cars, searching for any\nglimpse of the missing.\n\n   Some had worked all night, helping the survivors.\n\n   ``A lot of people were coming off the train searching for their\nfamily members,'' said Karen Brzezicki, a firefighter and paramedic\nfor the Bourbonnais Fire Department who was one of the first\nworkers on the scene. ``That was the hardest part, people searching\nfor their children. This is one of those things you don't want to\nsee and you hope you never have to see again.''\n","Headline":"\n13 KNOWN DEAD, 114 HURT, SOME BELIEVED MISSING IN AMTRAK CRASH \n","Text":["\n   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,\ncomfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car\nof a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans.
