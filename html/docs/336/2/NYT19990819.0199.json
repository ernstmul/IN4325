Wild\nbears in the Smoky Mountains and other national parks are naturally\nafraid of people, but may turn dangerous when they learn to eat\nfood we humans eat. And they can smell food _ or garbage containing\nfood _ from far away.\n\n   Black bears were once hunted close to extinction in the Smoky\nMountains. Protected since the park was founded in 1930, their\npopulation has grown to more than 1,000.\n\n   ``There's really not any place you can go in the park that there\nare not black bears. We have one of the highest densities of black\nbears in North America,'' says Kim DeLozier, wildlife biologist for\nthe park.\n\n   One way we can help keep bears alive is by not feeding them.\nInstead, DeLozier says, keep them at a distance _ from yourself,\nchildren, pets, cabins and campsites. And never leave anything that\nsmells of food where bears might find it.\n\n   When you're in bear country, put all food, food wrappers,\ncooking foil and strong-smelling items such as toothpaste, soap and\nshaving cream out of the reach of bears. Bear-tempting garbage\nshould be left in the bear-proof containers _ cans or Dumpsters _\nthe National Park Service provides within the park or locked up\ninside a bear-proof vehicle or structure.\n\n   Bears live a lot longer if they eat grasses, seeds, berries,\nants, acorns and other natural foods, rather than hot dogs,\nTwinkies and potato chips. It's not so much a question of a\nhealthful diet as of preserving a healthy distance between bears\nand humans. Bears that become accustomed to human food become\nthreats to people and to themselves: They may seek food along\nroadsides until they're accidentally killed by a car, or they may\ninjure park visitors and have to be euthanized.\n\n   If you find yourself face to face with a bear, the National Park\nService advises you to back away slowly (don't run) and seek\nshelter in a car or a house. If the bear looks as if it's going to\nattack you, get aggressive. Try to fight back with any object\navailable; wave your arms, and make as much noise as you can.
