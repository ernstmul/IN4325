They're\nwandering out of the woods and into the suburbs _ where they have\nbeen known to break into houses, surprise backyard barbecuers and\ngenerally wreak havoc. With the number of bear sightings _ and\nencounters _ on the rise, it's time to brush up on your\n``bear-proofing'' skills and learn what to do if you come\nface-to-face with a 500-pound grizzly.)  \n (Includes B&W illustration of a snake coiling, then striking.\nCREDIT: ILLUSTRATION BY BRENDA BROWN.) \n By JOSHUA PIVEN and DAVID BORGENICHT  \n (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  \n\n   There are about 650,000 black bears in North America, and only\none person every three years is killed by a bear _ although there\nare hundreds of thousands of encounters. Most bears in the\ncontinental United States are black bears, but black bears are not\nalways black in color: Sometimes their fur is brown or blond. Males\nare generally bigger than females (125 pounds to 500 pounds for\nmales, 90 pounds to 300 pounds for females).\n\n   Bears can run as fast as horses, uphill or downhill. They can\nalso climb trees.\n\n   Bears have excellent senses of smell and hearing _ and they're\nextremely strong. They can tear cars apart looking for food.\n\n   Every bear defends a ``personal space.'' The extent of this\nspace will vary with each bear and each situation; it may be a few\nfeet or a few hundred feet. Intrusion into this space is considered\na threat and may provoke an attack.\n\n   It's important to know that bears aggressively defend their\nfood. Stay away from dead animals because bears may attack to\ndefend such food.\n\n   Female bears defend their cubs. If a female with cubs is\nsurprised at close range or is separated from her cubs, she may\nattack.\n   WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE A BEAR     \n\n   _ Make your presence known by talking loudly, clapping, singing\nor calling out. Whatever you do, make sure you are heard. It does\nnot pay to surprise a bear.\n\n   _ Keep children close at hand.\n\n   _ There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear _ the\nfarther, the better.\n\n   _ If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle. Do not get out,\neven for a quick photo. Keep your windows up. Do not impede the\nbear from crossing the road.\n   HOW TO ESCAPE FROM A BEAR     \n\n   If a bear is threatening you:\n\n   _ Lie still and quiet. Documented attacks show that an attack by\na mother black bear often ends when the person stops fighting.\n\n   _ Stay where you are. Don't try to climb a tree to escape. Black\nbears can climb trees easily and will come after you. The odds are\nthat the bear will leave you alone if you stay put.\n\n   _ If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with\nanything you can.
