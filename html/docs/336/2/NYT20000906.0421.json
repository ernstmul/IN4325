COLORADANS ASK, AS BEARS FORAGE CLOSER\nTO HOMES \n\n   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   BASALT, Colo. _ It was bad enough when Steve Solomon and his\nwife, Bates, found the skunk crawling around under their bed at 2\na.m. That they could deal with. Sooner or later, Solomon figured,\nthe critter would make its way out the front door, which they\nroutinely left open for the breeze. But was the door still open?\nSolomon had to check.\n\n   That's when he froze. It was open, all right. But standing only\n20 feet away at the compost bin was a large black bear, chomping on\nthe remains of a cantaloupe.\n\n   ``It must have been twice my size,'' Solomon said Wednesday,\nguessing the bear's weight at 400 pounds or more. ``I had a skunk\nbehind me, a bear in front of me. I didn't know which one was\nworse.''\n\n   Solomon is hardly the only Coloradan who of late has lived out a\nGoldilocks tale in reverse. Because of a hot, dry summer that has\nwithered natural food supplies, and with an ever increasing number\nof people living closer to forests and wilderness areas, bears have\nbeen meeting up with humans at an alarming rate throughout the\nstate.\n\n   So far, only a smattering of human injuries have been reported,\nall of them minor. The encounters have been worse on the bears,\nmore than 25 of which have been put to death this year under\nColorado's two-strikes-and-you're-out policy for those that forage\ntoo close to people. Over the same period last year, the state\nkilled only six.\n\n   Biologists and state officials say that if there are more\nsummers like this one, and if home construction near mountainous\nareas continues at its feverish pace, more dangerous confrontations\nare inevitable.\n\n   ``If a bear learns where to find human foods, he's likely to\ncome back,'' said Chuck Schwartz, an expert in bears as the leader\nof the United States Geological Survey's Interagency Grizzly Bear\nStudy Team, in Bozeman, Mont. ``They have very good memory, and\nthey don't differentiate. If it's edible, they'll eat it.''\n\n   Grizzlies are not to be confused with the black bears roaming\nColorado and other states. Grizzlies, larger than black bears and\nmore threatening to humans, are generally found only in areas\naround two national parks in the northwest Rockies, Yellowstone and\nGlacier, putting them at greater distances from population centers.\n\n   Black bears, which are known to attack humans only when they\nfeel trapped, are commonly found in dense forests and mountain\nterrain at high elevations, where they have encountered unsuitable\nconditions in Colorado this year. A late spring frost and endless\nsummer weeks of uncommonly hot and dry weather have cost them their\nusual meals of acorns and berries.\n\n   Bears typically eat up to 20 hours a day in the warm months to\nput on enough weight to last the winter. Denied their natural\nfoods, they have been foraging closer to homes and towns to\nscavenge landfills, trash cans, even dog dishes, making this year\none of the most active for officials responding to calls from\nfrightened people throughout the Rocky Mountain West. In Colorado,\nreports of bear sightings and encounters now occur almost daily.\n\n   ``Everybody has a bear story,'' said Solomon, a jewelry maker\nwho has lived for 15 years in Basalt (pronounced buh-SALT), a\nmountain town 20 miles northwest of Aspen. ``One woman on the next\nstreet down was canning in her kitchen with the door open. A bear\nwandered in to help her out.''\n\n   ``I know another family,'' he said, ``who eliminated every bit\nof food from their house, scrubbed it down and now only eats in\nrestaurants.''\n\n   In Aspen, the food is apparently so tasty that for the first\ntime bears have been spotted poking into garbage bins along Main\nStreet this year. Other bears have wandered along streets in Grand\nJunction. Tom Theobald, a beekeeper near Boulder, said bears had\ntwice ravaged his colonies, eating the honey and destroying\nequipment at a cost that now exceeds $2,000.\n\n   ``I don't know how they do it,'' he said of the bears'\nmarauding. ``They must be taking an awful lot of stings.''\n\n   Most encounters this summer have ended peacefully, but some have\ntaken their toll on the bears, especially those that officials have\npreviously encountered, tranquilized and tagged. Any tagged bear\nthat returns to where people live is put to death under the state\nprogram if it can be caught. In addition, property owners have a\nright to shoot a bear that is threatening human life.\n\n   According to the Colorado Department of Wildlife, 74 black bears\nwere killed in those two ways through Aug. 31, and the number is\nclimbing so rapidly that officials say this year could easily\nbecome the worst for the bears in a decade.\n\n   Towns like Aspen and Snowmass Village, near bear habitat, are\ntaking steps to discourage the scavenging by requiring residents to\nupgrade garbage receptacles and bringing misdemeanor charges\nagainst those who do not comply.\n\n   Here in Basalt, Solomon has begun storing his trash elsewhere.\nFor the first time since he moved in all those years ago, he is\nlocking his front door at night.\n","Headline":"\n`WHO'S BEEN EATING MY FOOD?'
