Times News Service   \n\n   STILLWATER, N.J. _ Danette Conroy was upstairs cleaning kitchen\ncabinets and her year-old daughter Kayleigh was asleep when the\nblack bear somehow got into the ground floor of their new home.\nThey never heard a thing until the crash of breaking glass. The\nbear, apparently startled by the arrival of Conroy's husband,\nChris, had plunged through a double-paned window and stumbled away\ntoward the woods.\n\n   ``I've lived in Stillwater since I was age 4, and now I'm 41,''\nsaid Chris Conroy, a hunter, recalling what happened last summer.\n``I've never ever, even seen a bear until about five years ago.''\n\n   These days, everybody in this township of 4,500 on the slopes of\nthe Kittatinny Mountains of northwestern New Jersey seems to know\nsomebody with a bear story. Charlie McMahon raised goats as a hobby\nfor 15 years until a bear killed two of them three years ago. Two\nweeks ago, at a Boy Scout camp in nearby Allamuchy, a bear yanked a\nsleeping bag _ with a teen-ager inside it _ off a bench; the youth,\nwho was uninjured, screamed and frightened off the bear.\n\n   And last summer, a bear broke up Diane Apostola's backyard\nbarbecue for 20 relatives. ``He just came walking down like he was\ncoming to the party with us,'' Apostola said. ``We all ran into the\nhouse, and he just left.''\n\n   As the numbers of black bears and people have grown in forested\nareas of the New York region, the bears _ once timid and content\nwith isolated lives in the woods _ are venturing more and more into\ncampgrounds, yards and even houses in search of food. The place\nwhere their wanderings have caused the biggest stir is New Jersey;\nthe state Division of Fish and Wildlife said it received 1,659\ncomplaints about bears last year, up from 285 in 1995.\n\n   Most of the complaints were about bears roaming in backyards and\ngetting into garbage and bird feeders, but 28 of them involved\nbears killing livestock and 29 were about bears getting into homes.\nAlthough none of the complaints involved bears attacking or\ninjuring people, the intrusions have imposed anxieties and\nrestrictions on life in this wooded corner of the state.\n\n   The New Jersey Fish and Game Council will hold a public hearing\nTuesday on its proposal to allow bear hunting this fall for the\nfirst time in 30 years. The council wants to reduce the state's\nbear population, now estimated at 1,000, to between 250 and 330 in\nthe next three years in order to cut down on encounters between\npeople and bears.\n\n   ``We see this as a safety issue,'' said John W. Bradway,\nchairman of the council. ``Some people fear for their children's\nsafety.''\n\n   The hunting proposal, made last March, is opposed by 22 animal\nrights groups that want the state to do more to teach people to\ncoexist with bears.\n\n   ``There's no overpopulation problem,'' said Lynda Smith,\ndirector of one such group, the Bear Education and Resource Group\nof West Milford, N.J. ``If we cut off food in the neighborhoods,\nthe bears won't come in.''\n\n   But the animals have a keen sense of smell that can penetrate\neven the strongest barriers to food. Two summers ago, a black bear\nbroke into Carolyn and Michael Ganon's home here by yanking an\nair-conditioner out of a window and crawling in through the hole _\napparently seeking an uncovered canister of chocolate-covered\ntoffee in the family room. Terrified, the couple's son, Leland, 13,\nran upstairs and called 911. The police found the animal sitting\nnear the Ganons' porch, calmly eating the candy.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Though the township of Stillwater is sparsely settled,\ndevelopment has grown steadily in the last 20 years in sections of\nSussex, Passaic, Morris and Warren Counties that were once covered\nwith forests. The bears _ hearty eaters and intelligent, adaptable\nanimals _ have come to rely on people to broaden their diet of\nberries, acorns, skunk cabbage, rabbits and other small mammals.\n\n   Bears have long been meandering into settled areas, particularly\nin the summer, as the young are rousted from their lairs to make\nway for new offspring. But experts say the bears being spotted now\ntend to be older and more brazen.\n\n   As their numbers grow, they have migrated to more thickly\npopulated counties, including Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon and\nSomerset.\n\n   They are also showing up in other parts of the region. Bears\nrecently broke into a dozen homes in southeastern New York. One\ntore cabinets off a kitchen wall and tipped over a refrigerator\nlooking for food in Olive, in Ulster County, said Dick Henry, a New\nYork state wildlife biologist.\n\n   In Connecticut, bear sightings and complaints tripled last year,\nto about 300, and livestock killings, a rarity in the state, were\nreported in the rural northwest, said Paul Rego, a state wildlife\nbiologist.\n\n   ``What we're seeing is habituation of bears to people and to\npeople's garbage,'' said Jon Rosenberg, superintendent of parks in\nWest Milford, a bear haven in northern Passaic County. He has\nworked with New Jersey's bear research team since 1983. Female\nbears teach their cubs about food sources both in deep woods and in\nbackyards, and the bears will return again and again for garbage,\nbird seed and pet food at homes, and for morsels at campsites and\ncountryside picnics and cookouts, Rosenberg said.\n\n   Black bears are easily intimidated if people yell, wave their\narms or bang pots and pans. But repeated, uncontested forays into\nbackyards can lessen the bears' natural shyness and wariness of\npeople, he said.\n\n   When Veronica Stevans moved to Stillwater 12 years ago, she\noccasionally spotted a bear at night near her home. ``It's a whole\ndifferent world now,'' Stevans said. ``Now you see them at any time\nof day. They're bolder.'' She added, ``They're not afraid of noise\nanymore.''\n\n   Once, she said, she felt at ease walking alone on country roads.\nNow she brings along a 4-inch can of pepper spray and her dog.\n\n   ``Bear proofing'' has become a way of life here. People talk of\njogging and walking with whistles, air horns, firecrackers and\npepper spray. Shooting bears, however, is currently illegal.\n\n   nn\n\n   Gay Quarty, who saw a bear near her barbecue grill last year,\ntakes walks with a golf-ball-size jingle bell attached to one of\nher sneakers. ``It looks ugly and stupid, and I don't know if it\nreally works,'' she said, ``but it gives me peace of mind.''\n\n   Many people shut their windows and doors before they cook, and\nmany store garbage in their basements or sheds until pickup day.\nPaul Klimek has installed electric wiring around his pigpen and\nwraps bacon around the wires, guaranteeing a slight shock to any\nbear biting the meat.\n\n   At Swartswood State Park, a stuffed black bear stands on its\nhind legs in the lobby, next to a picnic basket and a sign warning\ncampers to keep all coolers and baskets in their cars when they are\nnot being used. Campers face eviction and a $71 fine if they feed\nbears, intentionally or accidentally, and if their car windows are\nfound open, even a crack, when food is stored inside. Rangers say\nbears can rip the window out to get the food.\n\n   Since 1997, rangers at Swartswood and other state parks in or\nnear the Kittatinny Mountains, including High Point, Stokes and\nWorthington, have shot rubber buckshot and explosive noisemakers at\nbears that linger around campsites or garbage bins. This tactic is\nmeant to stop bears from associating people with ``positive rewards\n_ a snack or a meal,'' said Patrick Carr, principal wildlife\nbiologist for the Division of Fish and Wildlife.\n\n   But more drastic measures are being taken. Four bears deemed\npotentially dangerous were trapped and killed last year by New\nJersey animal control agents, including two that had broken into\nhomes in Sussex County. In March, the Fish and Game Council\nproposed the resumption of bear hunting, which the state banned in\n1970, when the bear population had been all but wiped out.\n\n   Hunting would be limited to the northern half of the state;\nbills to prohibit bear hunting have been introduced in the state\nLegislature, but they are stalled in committees.\n\n   Opinions here on the proposal are divided, even among those who\nhave had encounters with bears. The Township Council in West\nMilford, where the animals are plentiful, says it opposes the hunt\nbecause bears are attractive and symbolize the state's little\nremaining wilderness.\n\n   In Stillwater, Ed Szabo, a hunter, no longer hangs deer\ncarcasses in trees behind his house to dry because bears ate them\nat night. He favors bear hunting, but says he has no interest in\ntaking part.\n\n   In Green Township, Dede Esenlohr said she sleeps uneasily\nbecause bears often come onto her deck at night. Last summer, she\nwatched two bears kill two fawns in her yard. But she favors a\nsterilization program because, she says, too many bears will be\nwounded and left to suffer or turn dangerous.\n\n   The Humane Society of the United States, which opposes the hunt,\nhas asked the state to conduct a joint study into injecting 20\nfemale bears with a vaccine that prevents conception. The state has\nnot responded, said Allen Rutberg, the society's senior wildlife\nscientist. ``The bear problem in New Jersey is not a crisis, not\nlike the deer issue,'' he said.\n\n   But bears inspire a fear that deer do not, especially after a\ndeath last month in Gatlinburg, Tenn. On May 21, the body of Glenda\nAnn Bradley, 50, of Cosby, Tenn., a teacher and experienced hiker,\nwas found partly eaten by two bears in the Great Smoky Mountains\nNational Park. An autopsy to determine if the bears had killed her\nis not complete, said Nancy Gray, a park spokeswoman.\n\n   Lynn Rogers of Ely, Minn., an expert on black bears, said fatal\nattacks by black bears are extremely rare _ only about 40 in North\nAmerica in this century. People face a greater chance of being\nkilled by dogs, lightning or bee stings, he said.\n\n   TIPS FOR DEALING WITH BEARS\n\n   Blacks bears are intelligent and extremely strong and have keen\nsenses of smell and hearing. They are excellent swimmers and tree\nclimbers and can run up to 35 miles an hour. Adult males average\nabout 350 pounds, but can weigh as much as 600 pounds. Adult\nfemales average about 200 pounds. Black bears are normally not\naggressive toward humans and will usually flee if people make a lot\nof noise.\n\n   When threatened, black bears may issue a warning by popping\ntheir jaws, making huffing noises, swatting the ground or bluffing\na charge. If faced with a bear doing any of these things, people\nshould remain standing, avoid direct eye contact, back away slowly\nand talk in a calm but assertive tone. Make sure the bear has an\nescape route.\n\n   AT HOME:\n\n   _ Never feed or attempt to pet bears.\n\n   _ Hang bird feeders at least 8 feet off the ground and take them\ninside at night.\n\n   _ Take uneaten pet food inside at night.\n\n   _ Store garbage in sheds and garages, away from doors.\n\n   _ Keep barbecue grills clean of grease.\n\n   AT CAMP:\n\n   _ Never keep food, snacks, candy, gum or their wrappers inside\ntents or shelters.\n\n   _ Keep a clean camp and minimize food odors.\n\n   _ Store food in vehicles, with windows rolled up, or in\ncommercially sold, airtight bear-proof containers.\n\n   _ Wash dishes immediately after using them and dump water away\nfrom camp.\n\n   _ Put garbage and cooking grease in garbage bins or bear-proof\ncontainers.\n\n   _ Wash any food from your face and hands before going to sleep.\n\n   _ Hang clothes with food or cooking grease on them beyond bear's\nreach.\n\n   Sources: New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife; Lynn Rogers,\ndirector, North American Bear Center, Ely, Minn.  \n","Headline":"\nBEARS BECOME UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE NEIGHBORS IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY \n","Text":["\n   STILLWATER, N.J. _ Danette Conroy was upstairs cleaning kitchen\ncabinets and her year-old daughter Kayleigh was asleep when the\nblack bear somehow got into the ground floor of their new home.\nThey never heard a thing until the crash of breaking glass.
