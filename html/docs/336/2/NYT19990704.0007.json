Times News Service clients)  \n By BARRY BURKHART  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX - Ron Engel-Wilson cringes when he's asked for\npredictions on this year's quail season.\n\n   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' said Engel-Wilson, the\nArizona Game and Fish Department's small game biologist. ``People\nhold me to them. I get into too much trouble.''\n\n   Then he did it anyway _ conditionally.\n\n   Because of this extremely dry year, he said, things don't look\ntoo bright for Gambel and scaled quail.\n\n   ``Last year, hunters killed about 750,000 quail,'' he said.\n``This coming season, it probably will be more like half a\nmillion.''\n\n   That means breeding season wasn't too successful. To make great\nthings happen, rain needs to fall late in the year, and more should\nfollow in February and March. That causes green plants to grow,\nstimulating egg production in females that eat the plants.\n\n   The rain also produces insects that chicks eat for important\nprotein.\n\n   This spring, Arizona got moisture in late spring, but it was too\nlittle and too late in the desert.\n\n   Mearns quail, which hold in tight coveys and are considered to\nbe trophies among hunters with pointing dogs, are different.\n\n   These birds, which dwell only in the southeastern part of the\nstate, rely on summer monsoon rain to spur their reproduction.\nThat's why the Mearns season opens much later than that for Gambel\nor scaled quail.\n\n   ``Good monsoon rain in the southeast would really help the\nMearns,'' Engel-Wilson said. ``It also would be of some help to\nGambel and scaled quail.''\n\n   He said last year was a great season for Mearns quail. More than\n15,000 were killed.\n\n   ``But if we're going to have a good season, we must have the\nsummer rain,'' Engel-Wilson said.   \nFerrets booming   \nThe endangered black-footed fer ret, one of the rarest mammals in\nthe world, was reintroduced to Arizona in 1996. And it appears the\nanimals have every intention of making it this time.\n\n   Sixteen of 17 gave birth to 63 kits this year at the\nreintroduction site in Aubrey Valley near Seligman, in the\nnorthwestern part of the state.\n\n   Together with the ferret breeding program at the Phoenix Zoo,\n100 ferrets were born in Arizona this spring.\n\n   That's an amazing number, a success rate of 93 percent compared\nwith 63 percent a year ago.\n\n   Most of the ferrets will be released into the Aubrey Valley\nsite. As many as 30 will be held for breeding next year. Arizona\nwill receive 20 additional kits from the national captive breeding\nprogram later this year.\n\n   Adult females have been released from their breeding boxes and\nhave taken their kits into underground burrows, where temperatures\nare much more suitable.\n\n   Ferrets prey primarily on prairie dogs at night.\n\n   They have been reintroduced in Wyoming, Montana and South\nDakota. There are plans for reintroductions in Colorado and Utah.\n\n   Game and Fish still is looking for volunteers for spotlighting\nsurveys of the ferrets through September. Those interested can call\nbiologist Richard Winstead at (520) 692-7700.   \nBears getting worse   \nDry conditions are causing more contact by wild animals with\nhumans. Bears are the biggest problem.\n\n   Wildfires, most of them small, are increasing the problem by\ndriving wildlife away from their territory.\n\n   Game and Fish officials are extremely concerned because some\npeople put out food and water for the animals or leave their trash\nunprotected. That invites trouble.\n\n   Some residents and visitors at Portal in southeastern Arizona at\nthe foot of the Chiricahua Mountains had been feeding wildlife\nintentionally. Wildlife officers were forced to kill a black bear\nbecause it had lost all fear of humans.\n\n   A bear in the Globe area killed a domestic goat. When wildlife\nofficers approached it, the bear showed aggression and was killed.\n\n   A mountain lion in the Sierra Vista area had been killing\nchickens and was found sitting on the front porch of residence.\n\n   During Memorial Day weekend, a young bear had to be killed after\nit became addicted to trash left out along Tonto Creek.   \nBarry Burkhart can be reached at (602) 444-8454 or at\nbarry.burkhart(at)pni.com via e-mail.  \n","Headline":"\nLACK OF RAIN COULD MAKE FOR SPARSE QUAIL HUNTING \n","Text":["\n   PHOENIX - Ron Engel-Wilson cringes when he's asked for\npredictions on this year's quail season.\n","\n   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' said Engel-Wilson, the\nArizona Game and Fish Department's small game biologist. ``People\nhold me to them.
