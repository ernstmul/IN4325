Times News Service   \n\n   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ New Jersey's first bear hunt in 30 years\nappeared doomed on Friday, 10 days before its planned start, after\nGov. Christie Whitman asked the state's Fish and Game Council to\ncancel it.\n\n   At the same time, she put into place a new state bear control\npolicy that she called wiser and safer than a general hunt.

But a coalition opposed to hunting has mounted a steadily\ngrowing campaign since May, prompting Whitman to retreat.\n\n   Over the last four months, opponents of the hunt have flooded\nher offices with letters and petitions, prompted the state Senate\nto pass a bill prohibiting hunting, and persuaded 25 towns _\nincluding several in bear terrain in the state's wooded northwest\ncorner _ to pass resolutions seeking the hunt's cancellation.\n\n   Jeff Tittel, executive director of the Sierra Club of New\nJersey, which is a member of the coalition, said that many people\nopposed the hunt because they viewed it as a sign that the state's\nonce-dense woodlands were being suburbanized.\n\n   ``If we can save the black bears, we can save what we love about\nthe uniqueness and the beauty of the area,'' he said.\n\n   Whitman's office released her letter to the council while she\nwas attending a luncheon in Manhattan honoring China's president,\nJiang Zemin, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Afterward, as diplomats\nmeandered through the hotel lobby, Whitman held a news conference\nthere on bears.\n\n   She said that bears in the state had been nearly extinct in the\nearly 1970s, but that the population had recovered to about 1,000\nanimals. Some bears, she said, were becoming more and more\naccustomed to the growing number of people in the northwestern\ntowns.\n\n   Whitman said she could not unilaterally suspend the hunt because\nthe Fish and Game Council was an independent agency empowered to\nwrite the state's hunting rules. But she and aides in Trenton said\nthey believed that the council would grant her request. If it does\nnot, she said, she will ask the state's attorney general, John J.\nFarmer, to explore ways to get a court order blocking the hunt.\n\n   In June, when the antihunt campaign was gathering momentum, the\ngovernor urged the council to reduce the number of bears to be\nkilled this fall to 175 from 350, and the council unanimously\napproved her request.\n\n   The state's Division of Fish and Wildlife proposed the hunt\nbecause the number of complaints about the animals had increased to\n1,659 in 1999 from 285 in 1995. Among the problems were reports of\n29 bears breaking into homes, up from three in 1995, and 28 bears\nrummaging around campgrounds and parks, up from five in 1995.\nAttacks on livestock and pets also increased sharply in the last\nhalf of the 1990s. But no attacks on people have been reported.\n\n   Under Whitman's new policy, the state will step up its actions\nagainst problem bears.
