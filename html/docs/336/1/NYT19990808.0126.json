Times News Service   \n\n   NEW PALTZ, N.Y. _ John Bradley has stared into the face of the\nworst drought in recent history. From the bone-dry stream beds and\nparched trails of the Shawangunk Mountains, something is staring\nback. It is black and furry and has inch-long claws.\n\n   Bradley, a management consultant who owns 2,500 acres in\nsouthern Ulster County, about two hours from Manhattan, is\ncontinually on his cell phone these days. The calls are from his\ntenants, panicked weekenders confronting black bears on the porches\nand lawns of their cabins, and even in their living rooms.\n\n   ``John, we have a bear on our porch,'' came the recent call from\nDavid Rockwell, the restaurant designer, who rents a log cabin on\nBradley's land. A dutiful landlord, Bradley scooped up a gravel\nrake and some dirty shirts and ran to the scene. He uses the smelly\nclothing to distract the bears while an escape is made, in a\ntechnique he calls ``drop and run.''\n\n   In the New York region, the problems of the drought extend\nbeyond dry wells and dead corn. Record heat and little rain have\nwithered berry bushes _ an important summer food supply for bears _\nand dried up streams on the mountaintops. Park rangers and\nnaturalists say this has forced bears, and even rattlesnakes, down\nfrom the mountains in search of food and water.\n\n   ``We've had movement of snakes,'' said Tim Sullivan, supervising\nforest ranger for the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which\nclosed 200 miles of hiking trails last week to avert forest fires.\n``Raccoons, they're traveling. Bears aren't any different, because\nmoist food is not that abundant.''\n\n   A steady increase in the bear population has made the problem\nworse, said Heinz Meng, a biology professor at the State University\nof New York at New Paltz. ``The blackberries have dried up,'' he\nsaid, ``and the bears are looking for other sources of food.''\n\n   Bears are popping up throughout the region. Bob Eriksen, the\nsupervising wildlife biologist for New Jersey's Division of Fish,\nGame and Wildlife, said that nuisance complaints about bears had\nreached a record high this year: 1,200 so far, compared with 892\nfor all of last year. New Jersey has had about 25 bear break-ins\nthis year, compared with 18 last year.\n\n   ``It's just a result of bears' living in close proximity to\npeople'' rather than drought conditions, Eriksen said, but he added\nthat if the drought continued, ``It will be a problem because the\nfood crop will be reduced.''\n\n   In the Shawangunks, the bear migration has changed life for\nBradley and his six tenants on the exclusive Awosting Reserve.\nBradley has spotted seven bears near the houses in the last month.\nThe last time he saw a bear below the mountain range _ just one _\nwas during the severe drought of 1964.\n\n   The bear Rockwell spotted had worked its way to the home of\nanother tenant, a Wall Street executive, by the time Bradley\narrived. A cub about the size of a golden retriever, it was eating\nfrom a bird feeder.\n\n   ``When I approached, it got up and walked directly through his\nfront door,'' Bradley recalled. ``I'm yelling, when it exits and\nleaps over the side of the porch.''\n\n   Two weeks ago, the sound of knocking brought Bradley, in the\nbuff, from his swimming pool. In his driveway, a mature bear was\nlifting the lid of the shed for his emergency generator. Bradley\ngrabbed dirty socks and got ready for the ``drop and run.'' The\nbear scooted eight feet up a tree and made off over a fence.\n\n   The bears are less like ravaging Huns, and more like thoughtless\nguests who turn weekend visits into protracted stays. They returned\nrepeatedly to the cabin of the Wall Street executive, rustling\nthrough his garbage, licking the grease off his barbecue grill and\nmunching from his bird feeder _ as he lay in a nearby hammock. ``I\nfinally drew myself up to my full height and told them to scram,''\nsaid the executive, who insisted on anonymity.\n\n   Richard Henry, a big-game biologist in the New Paltz office of\nthe state Department of Environmental Conservation, says that the\nrock ridge above the Awosting Reserve is part of a ``travel\ncorridor'' for bears, extending from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.\nWhile there are about 5,000 bears in New York state, no one has\nbeen hurt by one in 40 years.\n\n   But Rockwell's tenants, Daniel Sullivan and Alysa Wishingrad,\nsaid on Saturday that they felt no pity for the hairy and\ndisfranchised. They had survived the ultimate encounter: A mature\nblack bear had charged at them full-tilt, dust rising behind its\npaws.\n\n   They were up by Awosting Lake, a shady area blessed with rare\nsurviving berries, when two bucks bolted out of the forest, making\na sound like a speeding train.\n\n   ``The deer are running this fast for a reason,'' Ms. Wishingrad,\nwho is eight and a half months pregnant, recalled musing.\n\n   The mature black bear _ capable of hitting 30 mph _ was right\nbehind them.\n\n   ``We were falling all over each other, running and making\nnoise,'' said Sullivan, an executive recruiter for Internet\ncompanies.
