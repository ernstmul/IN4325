Times News Service    \n\n   After wandering at least 100 miles, a 175-pound black bear found\nits way into the heart of the business district of West Haven,\nConn., about 2 a.m. on May 1.\n\n   Some police officers, all rookies at capturing a downtown bear,\ngave chase, imitating barking dogs as they ran. Their first yelps\nwere feeble, recalled West Haven's animal control officer, Judy\nRettig. ``They were barking like Chihuahuas,'' she said. ``I said,\n`Rottweilers, men, Rottweilers!'''\n\n   The bear dashed through the parking lot of a video store, past\nsome startled students outside their dormitory at the University of\nNew Haven, and up a tree. In short order, the bear was\ntranquilized, tagged and transferred to the woods of northwestern\nConnecticut, almost a year after conservationists in New York state\ntagged it deep in the Catskill Mountains.\n\n   Ms. Rettig is plenty busy these days. Once she was simply West\nHaven's dog warden. But the job description grew.\n\n   ``We don't just do dogs anymore,'' she said. ``Now we're bear\ncontrol, raccoon control, possum control. You name it. No day is\nthe same anymore. You never know what you're going to catch.''\n\n   Throughout the New York region, wildlife biologists and\necologists echo her sentiments. The world of wildlife is far\ndifferent from what it was a generation ago, as more housing eats\ninto once distant wilderness. All sorts of species no longer stay\nsecluded in deep woods. They are popping up in odd spots: moose on\nthe developing outer fringes of suburbia; coyotes, fox, deer and\nthe ubiquitous Canada geese in older suburban towns; bears and\nturkeys in cities.\n\n   Development has disturbed the instincts of animals and their\nnatural fear of people, wildlife experts say. The steady push of\npeople into once-rural areas has eroded woodland habitats and\nreduced the open space for yearlings and weaned animals as they\nfollow their instincts and leave their birthplaces to search for\ntheir own turf.\n\n   ``They don't know what's in front of them,'' said James\nApplegate, a wildlife ecologist at Cook College, part of Rutgers\nUniversity in New Jersey. ``Now, in any direction it heads, it will\nrun into trouble sooner or later.''\n\n   Howard Kilpatrick, a biologist with the Connecticut Department\nof Environmental Protection, said that animals ``just wander\nrandomly.'' A meandering animal ``has no perception of what's down\nthere,'' he said.\n\n   William Weber, a wildlife ecologist with the Wildlife\nConservation Society, based at the Bronx Zoo, said that the\nanimals' final destinations are a matter of chance. ``Some of them\nhead in the right direction and they wind up in other forest,'' he\nsaid. ``Some wind up in suburbia. If we just keep clearing\neverything and animals keep getting squeezed, they're going to\ndisappear, or they'll settle in our own backyards.''\n\n   Peter Smallwood, an ecologist at the University of Richmond,\nnotes that a ``behavioral evolution'' has enabled animals to live\nmore comfortably than their predecessors near houses and humans.\n``I strongly suspect some of what we're seeing with this wildlife\ninvasion is changes of behavior by cultural evolution,'' he said.\n``They're learning how to get along in the suburbs.''\n\n   If these vagabond animals feel safe to eat and breed in a new\ndomain near people, they will stay, experts say. ``They'll learn to\neat what you plant in your backyard,'' said Susan Predl, a wildlife\nbiologist with the New Jersey Department of Environmental\nProtection.\n\n   For years, deer have roamed Barbara and Nick Van De Giesen's\nfront yard in the Bergen County borough of Old Tappan, N.J. Over\nthe Memorial Day weekend, a doe jumped the fence surrounding their\nbackyard and gave birth. At first, the doe nursed the fawn in the\nseclusion of white pines and underbrush at the rear of the yard.\nNow the feedings occur in the unsheltered front yard.\n\n   Once, moose were content to stay in northern New York and\nnorthern New England. But in the last two years, their wandering\nhas taken them to Kingston, N.Y.; Branchville, in northwestern New\nJersey, and northern Connecticut. Last June, a 500-pound female\nmoose meandered all the way to Old Saybrook on the Connecticut\ncoast before a car hit and killed it on Interstate 95.\n\n   Peregrine falcons, once nearly extinct, now nest on bridges and\noffice buildings in New York City and thrive on the flocks of\npigeons. A pair of red-tailed hawks has a nest on a luxury\napartment building at Fifth Avenue and 74th Street.\n\n   Wild turkeys are thriving in the region because of\nrehabilitation programs started in the 1980s. In late winter, eight\nwild turkeys rummaged around the suburban homes in West Orange,\nN.J.\n\n   Like the red-tailed hawks, turkeys have reached New York City.\nThey were spotted this year at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, on ball\nfields in nearby City Island and at the Bronx Zoo near the flamingo\npen.\n\n   Even coyotes, normally shy and furtive, are just about\neverywhere in the region, wildlife ecologists and biologists said.\nOn April Fool's Day, one found its way to Central Park.\n\n   ``They're very, very adaptable, much more adaptable than we\nthought 30 years ago,'' said Robert Eriksen, supervisor in charge\nof wildlife control for New Jersey's environmental department.\nNormally, coyotes eat rabbits, squirrels and other small wild\nanimals. But Eriksen and other experts cautioned that pet cats left\nout at night are becoming a favorite prey.\n\n   Weber said that coyotes are starting to ``behave like wolves''\nand form hunting packs on the edges of the suburbs.\n\n   In recent years, deer have made it to urban areas like\nElizabeth, N.J., and East Rutherford, near Giants Stadium.\n\n   And black bears are not only reaching West Haven; some have also\nmade it to downtown New Brunswick and Trenton. Last Friday, a bear\nwas spotted in Morristown, N.J., near the town's busiest stores.\n\n   Since 1979, calls about nuisance bears have increased from 15 to\n330 a year in a seven-county region of southern New York just north\nof New York City, including Westchester, Rockland and Orange, said\nDick Henry, a big-game biologist with the state's Department of\nEnvironmental Conservation. He estimates that there are 4,000 bears\nin the state. Glenn Cole, a wildlife biologist who is Henry's\ncolleague, recalls a black bear that broke through the screen door\nof a house near Kingston and helped itself to a fresh apple pie and\nsome cookies on a kitchen counter, before fleeing.\n\n   Connecticut's bear population is estimated at 30 to 60, double\nthe estimate in 1994. Paul Rego, a state wildlife biologist, said\nthat in the first five months of this year, the state received 70\ncalls of bear sightings, up from 25 in the same period last year.\n\n   Since New Jersey banned bear hunting in 1971, the state's bear\npopulation has doubled to about 600, and some seem to be getting\nmore aggressive toward other animals, said Dave Chanda, a state\nwildlife biologist. Earlier this year, he said, a bear killed a\nllama in a pen in Rockaway Township.\n\n   People in southern New York are increasingly gripped with\n``bearanoia,'' Henry said.\n\n   ``Generally speaking, the people fear they'll eat the kids and\neat the house,'' he said. ``Bears live around people a lot better\nthan people live around bears.'' Henry said black bears are not\nknown to bite or cuff at people unless people try to touch them.\n\n   Nonetheless, environmental officials in New York, New Jersey and\nConnecticut have prepared leaflets with tips on reducing encounters\nwith bears. Bears are attracted to the grain in bird feeders, bee\nhives, table scraps left on compost piles, uncovered garbage cans\nand greasy barbecue grills.\n","Headline":"\nSUBURBAN GROWTH DRIVES WILDLIFE INTO POPULATED AREAS \n","Text":["\n   After wandering at least 100 miles, a 175-pound black bear found\nits way into the heart of the business district of West Haven,\nConn., about 2 a.m. on May 1.\n","\n   Some police officers, all rookies at capturing a downtown bear,\ngave chase, imitating barking dogs as they ran.
