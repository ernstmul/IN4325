Times News Service clients)  \n By BARRY BURKHART  \n c.1998 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   It's about 5:30 a.m. on Memorial Day. The driver heads north on\nArizona 87 toward Payson. He is beyond the Saguaro Lake turnoff and\nenjoying the cool wind coming through the window.\n\n   A sleek-looking coyote appears from the median and trots across\nthe highway, stopping nonchalantly to watch the vehicle pass. The\ndriver smiles. The cool, early morning is a wonderful time to see\nall kinds of wildlife.\n\n   The vehicle begins its climb out of the lower desert. The driver\nhas not yet donned sunglasses to face the morning sun. He is\nadmiring the lush vegetation around him when he spots movement to\nthe right. Another coyote?\n\n   Not this time. A mountain lion emerges from the roadside\nvegetation and lopes across the highway. The driver has seen\nmountain lions in the wild but never one crossing a highway. He\nstarts to pull over, but that spooks the lion, which disappears\ninto the dense cover of the median.\n\n   The driver picks up his camera but decides plunging into the\ncover to ``play with kitty'' might not be a good idea. On a hike\nnear Strawberry several years ago, he was stalked by a young lion.\nHe remembers that, smiles again and drives away. This already is a\ngood day.\n\n   It's spring turkey season. The hunter has a permit and is along\nthe East Fork of the Black River in the White Mountains. He'll fish\nfor trout first, then go call up a turkey.\n\n   He uses a prepared trout bait (stinky stuff), then heads back to\nhis vehicle and stows his fishing gear. He picks up his turkey call\nand single-shot shotgun then heads off. He is being followed.\n\n   A black bear apparently has followed the scent of the trout\nbait. It reaches the vehicle after the hunter has left, works over\nthe vehicle a little, then eats a plastic saguaro cactus atop on\nthe vehicle's radio antenna.\n\n   Then it follows the hunter. The encounter is inevitable. The\nhunter shoots the bear with the shotgun. Asked later by wildlife\nofficers if he could have fired into the air to possibly spook the\nbear, the hunter says that he had no intention of trying to spook\nit with a single-shot gun.\n\n   The officers cut open the dead bear and find the plastic saguaro\nin its stomach.\n\n   The turkey hunter can't quit shaking after the encounter.\n\n   These stories, both thrilling and chilling, aren't at all\nunusual in Arizona. Such events occur probably a hundred times\nevery year. Arizona's two biggest predators, the black bear and the\nmountain lion, are exceptionally fascinating creatures.\n\n   The past few years were extremely dry and brought with them many\nbear stories. Times were tough. These extremely adaptable creatures\nfound an easy meal when they could. If food and water were scarce,\nsome would come into town to find relief, knocking down a few doors\nin search of food, eating garbage and even the occasional cat or\ndog.\n\n   This year has been different. El Nino's rains has meant\nplentiful prey throughout the state. Rabbits, quail and other\nwildlife that seemed to disappear are evident everywhere. Does that\nmean the state will see a corresponding spike in the number of\npredatory animals?\n\n   No, says John Phelps, the fur-bearer biologist for the Arizona\nGame and Fish Deartment.\n\n   The big animals _ bears, lions, elk and deer _ don't respond in\nthe short term to spikes in the number of smaller game and\nvegetation, he said.\n\n   ``There's not nearly as much reproduction from (bears and lions)\nas with small animals,'' Phelps said. ``You can see improvement in\ngood years, but it's not nearly as significant as in smaller\nanimals.''\n\n   Bears, Phelps said, are ``reproductively incapable.'' A female\ntypically is four years old before her first cubs are born. After\nthat, she typically will give birth every other year.\n\n   Lions aren't quite the same, he said, but even in good years,\nsurvival of the young isn't good.\n\n   ``Population density is limited by interspecific strife,'' he\nsaid. ``That means they kill each other. They're territorial\nanimals. It's a survival thing. If another animal of their kind\ninvades their territory, they might kill it.''\n\n   Male bears are especially protective, he said. Cub survival rate\nis no good because males often eat them.\n\n   ``We don't know exactly why,'' Phelps said. ``The cubs may be a\nfood source. Or it may be a sexual thing. They want to spread their\nown genes and don't want anything to interfere with that.''\n\n   Territory limits the number of large predators. Thus, it doesn't\nmatter how much food is available. The dominant creatures want no\nintruders on their territory.\n\n   Phelps said bears are more tolerant of each other. For instance,\nif acorns or prickly pear fruit is abundant, a large number of\nbears might share territory. They all have plenty and tolerate one\nanother.\n\n   Lions are different.\n\n   ``They're not like bears,'' Phelps said. ``They are meat eaters\n(bears are omnivorous). They seldom eat anything but something\nthey've killed. They don't allow an intruder.''\n\n   Lions fear humans and will stay away, apparently deciding that\nhumans are too large for their prey base.\n\n   Although bears are opportunists that will eat what they can,\nmost will stay away from civilization when their natural food is\nplentiful, as it is this year.\n\n   ``The most trouble we should have this year . . . are with bears\nthe are habituated to eating human garbage and things like that.''\n\n   Game and Fish officers will try to relocate those that do\nventure into campsites and outlying areas, though Phelps said that\nrelocations seldom are successful.\n\n   ``A fed bear usually is a dead bear,'' he said. ``Once they get\nused to feeding off humans, there's usually no way to get rid of\nthem but kill them.''\n\n   So you probably won't see much difference this summer in\npredator problems. These creatures seem to limit themselves. But\nwith abundant food, they'll probably be really healthy.\n\n   The populations won't increase or decline much. These creatures\nkeep their hunting grounds in order.   \nBarry Burkhart can be reached at 444-8454 or at\nbarry.burkhart(at)pni.com via e-mail.  \n","Headline":"\nEL NINO BRINGS PREDATORY FEAST  \n POPULATION LEVEL UNLIKELY TO SPIKE \n","Text":["\n   It's about 5:30 a.m. on Memorial Day.
