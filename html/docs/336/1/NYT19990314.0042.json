In 1996, the year before a dry spell ended,\nlarge portions of the forests were closed to the public before\nMemorial Day to prevent forest fires.\n\n   It worked. Wildfires were lower than the year before, mainly\nbecause they were confined to lightning strikes, not human\ncampfires and cigarettes.\n\n   This year the situation may be worse.

The forests this year could be closed to the public well\nbefore Memorial Day.\n\n   What's happening with wildlife issues?\n\n   The Arizona Game and Fish Department doesn't want to close\nfishing at a bunch of mountain lakes. The decreased sale of fishing\nlicenses costs the agency a lot of money. Since it's not financed\nby general fund taxes, those license fees are important to the\ndepartment.\n\n   ``We're going through the process of seeing which lakes are most\ndesirable to the public,'' said Larry Riley, chief of fisheries for\nGame and Fish. ``We have to see which waters won't be available to\nthe public.''\n\n   He wants the public to look for waters they don't usually use\nduring the summer.\n\n   If a number of mountain lakes close, he'd like the public to\nlook at Colorado River lakes, which got huge inputs of water from\nheavy snowfall in the Rockies.\n\n   Lakes Powell and Mead have great potentials for fishing this\nsummer, he said.\n\n   The department is in the process of predicting which mountain\nlakes will go dry, which will be marginal and which can sustain\npopulations of trout.\n\n   The department is prepared to stock trout at heavy levels _ and\nearly _ to avoid losing hatchery fish and to make fishing on other\nlakes as successful as possible.\n\n   The news isn't good for wildlife.\n\n   The production of acorns was excellent last year because of the\nrains. Everything from deer to bears profited from these\nhigh-calorie, high-fat nuts.\n\n   ``The female bears went into hibernation in great shape,'' said\nJohn Phelps, furbearer biologist. ``Their cubs (about 4 pounds now)\nare in great shape. But I expect by the end of summer that few cubs\nwill survive. It doesn't look good.''\n\n   He said that because the lack of food from the dry year, bears\nwill cover much larger territories.\n\n   ``They'll be active much longer in the day because food is\nscarce,'' Phelps said. ``Because they'll run a larger range,\nthey'll have to work much harder. They're eating machines when they\ncome out of hibernation. By ranging wider, they're much more likely\nto encounter humans.''\n\n   Phelps said that unlike bears, which are omnivorous, the\nmountain lions are likely to suffer more.\n\n   ``The are predominantly meat eaters,'' he said. ``They'll\nsometimes scavage if necessary, but primarily they kill what they\neat.\n\n   ``You have to understand that nothing starves to death with an\nempty stomach.
