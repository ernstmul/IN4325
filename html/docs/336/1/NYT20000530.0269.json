Besides winding\nnext to a river and through a hardwood forest, its great attraction\nis that the walk starts on a flat roadbed.\n\n   ``It's one of the easiest hikes in the Smokies and that's why we\ndecided to go,'' said Shane Kelley, 26, from Lebanon, Ohio.\n\n   But a yellow sign stapled to the trail marker made the hike less\ninviting to his father: WARNING. Bears Are Active In This Area.\n\n   Rangers posted the notices soon after a black bear mauled a\nTennessee school teacher on the trail May 21. The fatality\napparently is the first from a bear attack in the park's 66-year\nhistory. Officials are awaiting an autopsy report to verify that\nthe attack caused the woman's death. Previously, the only recorded\ndeath caused by a black bear in a national park occurred at\nYellowstone.\n\n   Neither of the Kelleys had heard about the attack a week before\ntheir Memorial Day weekend visit. Despite assurances from rangers\nthat the attack was an isolated incident, the elder Kelley decided\nto take a shorter walk.\n\n   His son hiked on.\n\n   ``If we see a bear, all I have to do is outrun you,'' Shane\nKelley joked with his dad, before hiking 2.3 miles on the Little\nRiver Trail to another path. The attack has raised bear awareness\nbut not deterred visitors from the most popular national park in\nthe country, which straddles the Tennessee-North Carolina line. Few\npeople have cancelled reservations in the park's developed\ncampsites or withdrawn backcountry permits.\n\n   On Tuesday, the park reopened three backcountry campsites (Nos.\n21, 23 and 30) near where school teacher Glenda Ann Bradley was\nkilled. A fourth, No. 24, remains closed because of reports of a\nthird bear in the area. Rangers there have set up a simulated\ncampsite and are cooking bacon and other fatty foods to see if it\nattracts a bear. A video camera will monitor the area through the\nweek.\n\n   More than 1,600 black bears live in the park, which is visited\nannually by 10 million people.\n\n   ``I'd say 99 percent of the people who visit have a respect for\nblack bears,'' park resource officer David Carney said at the\nSugarlands Visitor Center just outside Gatlinburg.\n\n   ``But 1 percent of 10 million people is still a lot. Someone who\nmight chase a black bear with a Nikon camera needs to realize it's\nnot a dog, it's not a cat, it's not a domesticated animal. It's a\nwild animal. If you picked up a rabbit here, it's a wild animal, it\nwill bite you. A black bear just happens to be big enough to do\nmore damage.''\n\n   Near the entrance to the Elkmont Campground, which is adjacent\nto the Little River Trail, a sign clearly designates the area: BEAR\nHABITAT. But every campsite was filled over the Memorial Day\nweekend.\n\n   Andy Massey, a 38-year-old metals buyer from Newnan, didn't\nhesitate hiking the Little River Trail with his wife and 4-year-old\nson. ``You've got a lot more chances of getting hurt in Atlanta\nthan on the trails out here,'' Massey said. ``Everybody that's come\nup to the Smokies has seen a bear. It's such a rare incident that\nsomeone gets hurt.''\n\n   The park averages about one minor injury a year because of a\nblack bear encounter, officials said. A female hiker was\nhospitalized 10 days in 1989 after a black bear attack.\n\n   The two-lane roads that snake through the Smokies frequently are\nclotted by ``bear jams'' _ traffic backups caused when motorists\npull off to watch black bears wandering in the woods.\n\n   A bear jam Sunday clogged Little River Road between the Elkmont\ncampground and the Sugarlands Visitor Center on U.S. 441. George\nKabel of Dallas, Ga., had his zoom lens zeroed in on the bears. It\nwas the first time he had seen a wild black bear.
