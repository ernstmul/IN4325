The attack has\nespecially sown fear among the tens of thousands of backpackers,\ncanoeists, and other outdoors enthusiasts seeking adventure in\nCanada's vast tracts of wilderness.\n\n   ``After that girl got killed, we decided to fold the tent,''\nsaid Ruth Greenberg of Cambridge, Mass., who with her husband and\ntwo daughters, ages 11 and 13, quit a camping spot near the\nSaguenay River for a hotel in Quebec's 17th century old town.\n\n   ``We'll look at the historic buildings and eat ice cream instead\nof communing with nature,'' she said. ``I'll leave encounters with\nwildlife to the National Geographic.''\n\n   The fear grew this week after a kayaker camping on a remote\nbeach in British Columbia was badly bitten in an apparent attack by\na timber wolf.
