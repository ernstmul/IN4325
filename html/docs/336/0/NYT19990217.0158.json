The path to the postseason hasn't been as smooth as in\nthe past _ the Huskies may not even win their sixth straight Big\nEast postseason title, given that tournament host Rutgers is tied\nfor first with UConn and lost by only a point in their only\nregular-season meeting. Even so, the Huskies' reality is different\nthan that of any other New England team. One question their fans\nwant answered: will their two-year Final Four drought end?\n\n   Boston College (18-6): Emphatic victories over Notre Dame and\nUConn helped guarantee the Eagles their first appearance in the\ntourney, negating a third straight midseason slump. At any rate,\nlosing to UConn, Rutgers, and Notre Dame is far less injurious than\nbeing defeated by Syracuse, Providence, and Villanova. Finishing\nthe regular season with two wins will give BC the 20 victories that\ncoach Cathy Inglese so covets; coupling that with a decent showing\nin the Big East tourney would seem to ensure at least a seventh or\neighth seed.\n\n   Maine (18-5): The Black Bears did nothing this season if not\nshow that theirs was more than a one-woman team. If America East\nopponents thought the graduation of All-American Cindy Blodgett was\ngoing to open doors for them, a three-headed offensive attack\nslammed it shut. Methuen's Jamie Cassidy (23.3 points per game),\nMedford's Kristen McCormick (45.9 3-point percentage), and Amy\nVachon (8.2 assists per game) all rank among the nation's top 10 in\ntheir categories as the Black Bears try for a fifth consecutive\nconference title (and automatic bid).\n\n   Other America East contenders include New Hampshire, which\ncounts on Orsi Farkas to lead it to a postseason surprise, as does\nVermont with Karalyn Church. Northeastern has its best team in\nyears, led by Tesha Tinsley and Betsy Palacek, and is certainly\ncapable of repeating its regular-season upset of Maine.\n\n   Holy Cross (18-7): Amy O'Brien is in the last few weeks of a\nwonderful four years with the Crusaders, and the school's all-time\nleading scorer would like nothing better than to cap her career\nwith a third Patriot League championship and subsequent NCAA berth.\nThe Crusaders have lost just one league game, so it would take a\nmonumental effort to deny them a second straight bid and sixth\noverall (second only to UConn among New England schools).\n\n   In the Ivy League, which does not conduct a postseason tourney,\nDartmouth is a game behind first-place Princeton with five games\nleft and plays the Tigers this weekend. Harvard and Brown also are\nstill in the running but need help from other teams.\n\n     \n   \nA thousand welcomes\n\n     \n  \n\n   The Northeast-10 Conference's 1,000-point club welcomed two more\nmembers last Saturday: Assumption's Stacy Mattioli, a junior from\nSturbridge, and Stonehill senior Becky Barrett of Needham each\nreached the milestone. For Barrett, the feat was even more\nimpressive since she's the NE-10's reigning defensive player of the\nyear . . . Jillian Danker, one of New England's most highly\nsought-after players as a senior at Minnechaug Regional in\nWilbraham last year, led Vanderbilt with 15 points in a Feb. 7 loss\nto No. 1 Tennessee.
