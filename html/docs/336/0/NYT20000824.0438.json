To say nothing of a pack of\nonlookers, may of them who knew the Grand Valley had been invaded\nby many bears this summer, at least 18 in all so far.\n\n   The bear was first spotted just east of Wal-Mart about 10 a.m. A\npolice dispatcher cracked that there must have been a special on\nhoney.\n\n   Police technician Paula Bockman was one of the first to get a\ngood look at the bear as it loped west across the Wal-Mart lot and\ninto a stand of scrubby elm barely 20 feet tall.\n\n   ``He was adorable,'' Bockman said.\n\n   The bear lingered only a short time, though, in the patchy\nshade.\n\n   Word crackled out from dispatch that the bear was on the move,\nthis time heading west.\n\n   As if to prove its claim to legitimate residency, the bear\nducked into the open door of Crown Liquors, said Grand Junction\nPolice Lt. Mike Nordine. Apparently finding nothing to its taste,\nit crossed the street and made back to the east, passing by an auto\nparts store and a Chinese restaurant. The bear found itself a\ncomfortable watching place in the shade of a line of slender elm\ntrees stretching 150 yards or so and settled in.\n\n   With trees behind and an open field in front, the bear had a\ncommanding view of its territory _ tiny, but indisputably its own.\n\n   Presently, company arrived. Police officers, onlookers and\nexperts watched the bear with a mixture of awe, sympathy and\nhealthy respect. The bear watched back.\n\n   Lyle Sidener, district wildlife manager for the Colorado\nDivision of Wildlife, parked about 75 yards away and studied the\nbear.\n\n   She was, Sidener estimated, a yearling that would go about 100\npounds. That was an estimate, he cautioned, saying, not for the\nonly time, ``It's not a perfect science.''\n\n   Still, the bear seemed to be in good shape, especially in\ncomparison to the 18 bears so far this summer that have been\ntranquilized between and replaced in the wild.\n\n   The bear's mother recently booted it out to fend for itself,\nSidener said, and that probably was the first of several cuffings\nthe yearling received as it crossed other bears' territories in\nsearch of a place it could call its own.\n\n   A late freeze and a dry spring and summer left precious little\nfood in the high country, forcing bears to cover larger territories\nand leaving less room for newcomers, such as this one, he said.\n\n   ``It's a bad year to be a bear,'' he said.\n\n   Much as he might wish to leave it alone, this bear had already\ncrossed the street on at least three occasions, which suggested a\ntraffic hazard at the least, Sidener said.\n\n   A hazard in town, and at a severe disadvantage in its normal\nterritory, the bear was out of place most everywhere, Sidener said.\n\n   Sidener sent for a tranquilizer kit and gun _ which looks like a\nsuper-hyped paintball weapon _ and settled in to wait.\n\n   Looking like a stump sticking out of the grasses _ albeit one\nwith rounded ears _ the bear seemingly glowed in the sun. Part of\nthe glow, Sidener said, was the light tips on the bear's fur. ``It\nalmost looks like he got a bad dye job,'' he said.\n\n   When his tranquilizer gun arrived, Sidener prepared for what he\nleast wanted _ a shot at a bear on the ground. The drug could take\nanywhere from five to 20 minutes to take effect and a bear on the\nground could cover a lot of territory in that time. He eyeballed\nthe bear to determine how much sleeping agent to inject and noted,\n``It's not a perfect science.''\n\n   With no trees capable of holding a yearling bear, Sidener had to\nrisk a shot at the bear on the ground. He took one shot from about\n30 yards, to apparent effect, but the bear never drifted into\nunconsciousness. The shot, it turned out, missed.\n\n   As Sidener approached for a second shot, the bear suddenly\nbounded up and ran east, into a thicket of elm and weeds. Police\nand the wildlife officers followed behind, trying to turn it back\nwith shouts and handclaps.\n\n   The bear made for the backlot of Grand Junction Nursery, filled\nwith trees and plants.\n\n   From within the greenery, officers could only rely on shouted\ninstructions and glimpses of their quarry, as well as other humans.\n\n   ``You've got a bear in there with you,'' called one to a nursery\nemployee. ``You might want to head in.''\n\n   ``But I've got to get this done,'' came the response.\n\n   The bear turned to the north and bounded ahead, climbing an\n8-foot fence in almost simian fashion and crossing another empty\nlot before disappearing into the urban wilds.\n\n   Not far away, elementary school children were called in from the\nplayground as the bear rambled around his realm.\n\n   Sidener and the officers retired back to their vehicles for a\nroad hunt _ one that lasted only minutes before the bear was\nspotted again.\n\n   Nordine was the first to arrive where the bear was treed in the\nback yard of James and Susan Brooks.\n\n   Otis, a 2-year-old chocolate Labrador, did what dozens of\ntwo-legged pursuers couldn't _ forced the bear into a tree.\n\n   Then, Otis ``nearly treed me,'' Nordine said.\n\n   Perched above roofline in the weeping willow, the bear attracted\na crowd.\n\n   ``Oh my gosh, how cute,'' said Shawna Mangum, who saw the bear\ndash through her back yard and followed it to the neighbors'.\n\n   The urban safari moved towards its end when Sidener pumped a\ndart into the bear's backside 32 feet above the ground. Once shot,\nthe bear lurched to the top of the tree, where it clung.\n\n   Meanwhile, officers, neighbors and passersby were recruited to\ncatch the bear in a tarp before it struck the wooden deck.\n\n   A play-by-play rang out as the bear lost consciousness. ``He's\nholding on by two paws. Now just the one. Now!''\n\n   The bear tumbled down from the crown of the tree, crashed\nagainst a limb and then hit with a heavy thud in the tarp, where\nshe was quickly gathered up and carried off.\n\n   The bear was tagged and was to be relocated to the mountains\nnear Silt or on the Uncompahgre Plateau, Sidener said.\n\n   In reasonably good health, Sidener said, the female wasn't as\nheavy as he had anticipated, maybe 75-80 pounds.\n\n   After all, he said, ``It's not a perfect science.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Small lots, narrow streets, scraggly\ntrees, children playing in the streets, swing-shift-working dads\nand stay-at-home moms, Wal-Mart in walking distance _ sure enough,\nit's bear country.\n","\n   Or at least it was was on Thursday.\n","\n   A yearling black bear sow claimed the territory for her own that\nday, only to be rudely chased about by a passel of police officers\nand a brace of wildlife officers.
