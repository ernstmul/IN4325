GORDONr   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged for the first time on\nMonday that it had bombed two separate groups of vehicles last week\nnear a Kosovo town, Djakovica, and might have killed civilians.\n\n   Until now, NATO has only acknowledged that its planes\naccidentally bombed a tractor northwest of Djakovica. But Serbian\nauthorities and Kosovar refugees have insistently reported allied\nhits along the road southeast of Djakovica, putting NATO\ncredibility to a severe test.\n\n   Providing its first comprehensive briefing on the attacks, in\nwhich the Serbs claim that 74 civilians were killed, NATO officers\nsaid their pilots, flying at high altitude, had been convinced they\nwere striking only military vehicles.\n\n   But as the raids proceeded, allied officers at a command post in\nItaly became concerned that fleeing refugees might be in the second\ngroup, a huge convoy of more than 100 vehicles southeast of the\ntown. Their suspicions were aroused after NATO intelligence experts\nwarned that Serbian forces do not generally travel in such long\ncolumns.\n\n   A pair of OA-10 observation planes were quickly dispatched.\nUsing binoculars, the pilots reported that civilian vehicles\nappeared to be interspersed with the military ones, and the attacks\nwere halted.\n\n   ``What we know from the debris that the Serbs showed is that\nsome civilians died there and that there is the possibility that\nNATO aircraft were the cause,'' said Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, the\nAmerican commander of an air wing at Aviano, Italy, who led the\nofficial NATO inquiry into the episode.\n\n   Monday's briefing demonstrated the difficulties of identifying\ntargets from high altitude over a region where Serbian army and\npolice forces have been driving civilians from their homes and\noften herding them down roads. Allied planes have spotted Serbian\ntanks concealed next to ruined homes, and Serbian soldiers have\nreportedly used tractors and other vehicles as well as military\nequipment.\n\n   Monday's assessment was also an important political test for the\nalliance. Since the air strikes against the convoys, on April 14,\nand the reports of civilian casualties, NATO spokesmen have been on\nthe defensive.\n\n   This was a result not only of the insistent Yugoslav charges,\nwhich Belgrade sought to reinforce by organizing visits to the\nscene by reporters; it was also a result of contradictory\nstatements by the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, and\nconflicting accounts of the raid by the Pentagon and the alliance.\nThe Yugoslavs continue to accuse NATO of killing civilians in\nplaces NATO said it did not bomb.\n\n   NATO sought to answer its critics on Monday by releasing a flood\nof information about aircraft patrols, laser-guided bombs and even\nconversations between the pilots and airborne controllers. NATO\nofficials said information was not released sooner because they had\nto interview pilots, gather intelligence information and analyze\ntelevision broadcasts to determine what had happened.\n\n   An excerpt was drawn from a conversation between an airborne\ncommand post, referred to in military parlance as AB-triple-C, and\nan F-16 pilot attacking the convoy.\n\n   ``We just received word that this is a VJ convoy,'' the command\npost told the F-16 patrols, using the acronym for the Yugoslav\narmy.\n\n   After weeks of bad weather and frustrating attempts to uncover\nhidden Serbian armor, the pilots thought they had stumbled on a\nbonanza.\n\n   ``Great!'' responded one of the pilots. ``AB-triple-C, I want as\nmany fighters as I can get, now.''\n\n   Important questions still remain, however. One is how many\ncivilians were killed; Leaf said reporters taken to the site saw\nonly about 20 victims.\n\n   Another is whether they were killed by allied planes or by\nSerbian artillery or even Serbian aircraft.\n\n   And another is whether the allies can reduce the risk of hitting\ncivilians without hampering their attacks on Serbian forces. There\nis also the question whether it is possible to dependably\ndistinguish civilian from military targets at an altitude of 15,000\nfeet.\n\n   Leaf said the episode began about 12:30 p.m. local time when a\npair of U.S. F-16's saw Albanian villages being set on fire north\nof Djakovica. Their call sign was Bear 21. The episode was first\ndocumented last week at NATO.\n\n   A pilot in Bear 21 saw people running from a house that burst\ninto flames and jumping onto a vehicle, which NATO officials said\nmay have been a tractor. Believing that they had set the house on\nfire, he attacked the vehicle with a laser-guided bomb, destroying\nit.\n\n   NATO officials added on Monday that in addition to the Bear 21\nattack, another bomb was later dropped north of the town in an\nattack by a different group of F-16's, Bear 41. Serbian television\nlater showed destroyed tractors at that site, raising the\npossibility of civilian casualties.\n\n   nn\n\n   NATO's principal disclosure on Monday, however, was of the later\nattack southeast of the town on a convoy of more than 100 vehicles.\nThat raid involved several sets of aircraft, including F-16's,\nFrench Jaguars, OA-10 observer planes and a flying airborne command\nand control aircraft, the AB-triple-C.\n\n   Another important link was NATO's command center in Vicenza,\nItaly, the Combined Air Operations Center, which coordinates the\nraids.\n\n   The raids on the second column began when two F-16's, Bear 31,\nsaw the convoy. From the start, the pilots were worried about the\npossibility of civilian casualties. With many villages aflame there\nwas reason to think that many refugees might be on the road.\n\n   Leaf said the pilots in Bear 31 had an ``extensive discussion''\nwith the command plane about whether the convoy was a civilian or\nmilitary target.\n\n   It was not easy for the pilots to identify the vehicles from\ntheir altitude, and while F-16's carry advanced military\ntechnology, these systems have their limits. Potential targets are\nshown in the F-16 cockpit on a special display, which is about 4.5\ninches wide and 4.5 inches high. The targets are not shown in\ncolor, but in shades of green.\n\n   An F-16 pilot has to look out the cockpit to see the color of\nthe vehicles below him, an important factor since military vehicles\nare often painted dark green. He cannot use binoculars because the\ncockpit is too small, a military official said.\n\n   As was the case of the Bear 21 patrol north of Djakovica, the\nBear 31 F-16's were flying air controllers, whose mission was not\nonly to carry out strikes but also to coordinate attacks by other\nallied planes.\n\n   Despite worries about refugees on the road, a number of factors\nled the Bear 31 pilots to conclude they had spotted a military\ncolumn: The 20 or so vehicles at the front appeared to be traveling\nin formation, with a set distance between them, and they were\nmoving quickly, leading the pilots to believe they were not\ntractors.\n\n   Further, the command and control plane told the F-16 pilots that\nthe convoy was made up of Yugoslav military vehicles.\n\n   The two F-16's in Bear 31 attacked the convoy, destroying one\nvehicle and missing one. They called in strikes by two French\nJacguar planes, who missed the convoy.\n\n   The F-16's ran low on fuel and were replaced by another pair,\nBear 41, who came under Serbian antiaircraft fire.\n\n   Suddenly there was an ominous warning. After twenty minutes of\nbombing the convoy, the command center in Italy wanted the planes\nto check the targets again and make sure that they were military.\nMilitary intelligence experts at the command center were dubious\nthat Serbian forces would be driving down an open road in such a\nlong convoy.\n\n   To get a better look Bear 41 asked for help from a pair of\nOA-10's, known as Cubs. The pilots reported that military vehicles\nhad been struck, but that civilian vehicles also seemed to be\npresent. By then eight laser-guided bombs had been aimed at a\nconvoy south of Djakovica, though not all of them hit their mark.\n\n   Leaf, while insisting that some military vehicles were hit, says\nother targets destroyed appeared to be tractors.\n\n   ``As we watch these videos in the comfort of this room and on a\nlarge display, it appears possible the vehicles are tractors or\ntractor-type vehicles,'' he said. ``As I reviewed the tapes with\nthe pilots, they agreed. However they were emphatic that from the\nattack altitude, to the naked eye, they appeared to be military\nvehicles.''\n\n   Leaf acknowledged that British Harrier pilots had seen a convoy\nin the area and had identified it as containing refugees. This\nhappened at about the same time as the attacks on the convoy were\nbeing carried out, but Leaf said the Harriers were ``not in\ncommunication with the aircraft in question.''\n\n   A senior allied officer said the episode has led NATO commanders\nto re-examine procedures for finding and identifying targets. But\nworried also about antiaircraft fire, the alliance appears intent\non continuing high-altitude strikes for now.\n","Headline":"\nNATO ACKNOWLEDGES CIVILIANS MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN BOMBING RAIDS\n","Text":["\n   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged for the first time on\nMonday that it had bombed two separate groups of vehicles last week\nnear a Kosovo town, Djakovica, and might have killed civilians.\n","\n   Until now, NATO has only acknowledged that its planes\naccidentally bombed a tractor northwest of Djakovica.
