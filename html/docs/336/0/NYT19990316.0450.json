Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, when Maurice Ashley was 14 and\nliving in Brownsville, Brooklyn, he was soundly defeated in an\noffhand game of chess. Embarrassed and angry, he dug up a paperback\non the game, intending to brush up, to learn a trick or two.\nInstead, he fell deeply in love.\n\n   The book was about Paul Morphy, a 19th-century Louisianian who\nwas America's first great player. ``I was stunned,'' he said\nTuesday. ``There were such dazzling plays.''\n\n   Ever since that first glimpse of the vastness and intriguing\npossibilities of chess, Ashley, an immigrant from Jamaica, has\nfocused his life on the game. On Monday, he reached the pinnacle of\nhis passion: He became the latest of the world's 470 grandmasters,\nand the first black person to reach the game's highest rank.\n\n   Since that first epiphany, Ashley's life has been centered on\nchess: playing it, studying it, coaching it and training for it. As\na student at Brooklyn Technical High School, he joined the Black\nBear School of Chess, a loosely defined group of young\nAfrican-American chess fanatics in Brooklyn. The young men, who\nwere mostly in their late teens or early 20s, would gather on\nFriday nights for ``chess rumbles.''\n\n   ``We were fighters, gladiators,'' Ashley said. ``You couldn't\nenter this group without being ready to go to war. Nobody would\nleave until Sunday. They'd shower, sleep a little, and get up and\nplay. Many a girlfriend was lost over weekend chess rumbles.''\n\n   Despite an inability to play chess, Ashley's girlfriend,\nMichele, hung on and became his wife. They have a 4-year-old\ndaughter, Nia, who does play. They live in the Park Slope section\nof Brooklyn.\n\n   In the clubby, eccentric world of chess, Ashley is known for his\nstraightforwardness, clarity and determined playing style, said\nAllen Kaufman, executive director of Chess-in-the-Schools, a\nnonprofit organization that provides expert players to teach chess\nin schools in low-income neighborhoods in the New York metropolitan\narea.\n\n   Ashley attained the rank of grandmaster on Monday as a result of\nhis play in a tournament sponsored by the Manhattan Chess Club. The\nrank is conferred by the International Chess Federation to players\nwho amass a set number of points in 24 official games played within\na seven-year period, said Eric C. Johnson, assistant director of\nthe U.S. Chess Federation. Of the federation's 85,000 members, 45\nare grandmasters, including 10 in the New York City area, Johnson\nsaid.\n\n   Before winning his last points Monday, Ashley's rank was\ninternational master, one step below grandmaster.\n\n   From 1991 to 1997, Ashley was the chess director of the Harlem\nEducational Activities Fund, at which he led teams, including one\nknown as the Dark Knights of Mott Hall, to three national\nchampionships. Three players on the teams won individual\nchampionships in their age groups.\n\n   ``I fell in love with coaching,'' Ashley said. ``I fell in love\nwith the kids.''\n\n   But two years ago, he stepped out of coaching to devote all his\ntime and attention to his dream. ``I was very frustrated,'' he\nsaid. ``My life's dream was to become a grandmaster, and my dream\nwas on hold.''\n\n   He adopted a training routine as rigorous as a prizefighter's.\nHe worked with a coach and spent hours every day playing and\nstudying, and attacking his weaknesses, including what he said was\na tendency to drift a bit.\n\n   There was the added weight of trying to become the first black\ngrandmaster. ``It was enormous pressure,'' he said. ``I could not\ngo to a chess tournament without hearing the question, `Where are\nyou going to do it?' So many people wanted this to happen to me.''\n\n   During the game he won that propelled him to grandmaster status,\nhis opponent moved a rook to attack Ashley's rook, a misstep that\nallowed Ashley to move his bishop to attack his opponent's queen.\nWhen he saw his opponent's mistake, Ashley said, he froze. Before\nhim was grandmastership, his life's goal. What if, in his terror,\nhe dropped his bishop?\n\n   Since his triumph, he has had a chance to reflect on his\nachievement as the first black grandmaster.\n\n   ``It makes it much sweeter,'' he said. ``It's not significant to\nme to be the best black chess player in the world. But it is sweet\nto be the first.''\n\n   What now? ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I'm still a beginner,\nas far as I'm concerned. There's so much to learn. The game is\nstill fresh for me.''\n","Headline":"\nFROM BROOKLYN COMES THE FIRST BLACK GRANDMASTER\n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, when Maurice Ashley was 14 and\nliving in Brownsville, Brooklyn, he was soundly defeated in an\noffhand game of chess.
