Times News Service   \n\n   SEATTLE _ A man who officials said brought a car with a trunk\nfull of bomb-making materials on a ferry from Canada, and then led\ncustoms officials on a foot chase through the streets of a\nWashington port town, was arrested by federal authorities, who said\nFriday that his target, his motives and his background remained a\nmystery.\n\n   The man, who had more than 150 pounds of bomb-making chemicals\nand detonator components in the car, was detained Tuesday just\nafter driving off a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, in Port\nAngeles, Wash. He had a reservation for a downtown Seattle motel\nTuesday night and also had reserved tickets to fly Wednesday from\nSeattle to New York and to connect from there to a London-bound\nflight, federal authorities said Friday.\n\n   The FBI and the CIA are investigating the incident, a government\nofficial said Friday. How and when the man planned to use the\nmaterials in his car are just two of the numerous questions\nsurrounding the incident. Although, as one government official said\nFriday: ``There's nothing mysterious at all about what was in that\ncar. It was stuff for a bomb, a powerful bomb.''\n\n   Government officials said the man's actions, use of fake\nidentification and background fueled suspicions that he could be\npart of an international terrorist network.\n\n   The officials said they believe the man is Algerian, is 28 years\nold and that his name is Ahmed Ressam. They say he arrived in Los\nAngeles on Feb. 7 on a flight from Seoul, South Korea, and that he\nwas next seen in Vancouver, British Columbia, in October. They said\nhis passport, which listed his name as Benni Noris and gave his age\nas 28, was false. The officials also believe that both of the\nCanadian driver's licenses, bearing his picture, that he was\ncarrying were falsely obtained. One was under the name of Benni\nAntoine Noris\n\n   The suspect was carrying maps of Washington, Oregon and\nCalifornia in the car with him, officials said.\n\n   Shortly before 4 p.m. Friday, a slight man with short black hair\ndressed in a blue button-down shirt, black pants and jail booties\nwas led into a federal courtroom here. In court papers federal\nprosecutors indicated that he would be charged, under the name of\nAhmed Ressam, with illegally transporting explosive material into\nthe country, making false statements on his customs forms and\ncarrying false indentification. A court interpreter spoke to him in\nArabic, and an arraignment was scheduled for Wednesday. Ressam, who\nofficials said also spoke French, did not speak, and the two public\ndefenders who appeared with him did not speak to reporters\nafterward.\n\n   The arrest comes after a recent State Department warning that it\nhad received ``credible information'' about plans for terrorist\nattacks against U.S. citizens around the time of the Jan. 1\nmillennium celebration. The department's ``worldwide terrorism\nwarning'' advised Americans to stay away from ``large gatherings\nand celebrations'' throughout the world for the rest of this year,\nbut it did not specify any groups planning attacks or state where\nsuch attacks might occur.\n\n   Two federal officials in Washington said Friday that the CIA had\nbeen called in on the case. One of them said the intelligence\nservice was asked to join the case because of suspicions that the\nman may be tied to terrorists.\n\n   The incident in Washington state began on Tuesday when the man\ndrove off the ferry from Victoria, said Pat Jones, a spokesman for\nthe Customs Service. An inspector started asking him routine\nquestions and, noting that he appeared very nervous, she soon asked\nhim to step out of the car.\n\n   The man initially refused, Jones said, causing the inspector to\ncall for back-up. The man then got out of his car and ran away,\nstopping in a brief and unsuccessful effort to commandeer a passing\ncar, then, a few blocks later, to hide under a truck. He was caught\nabout six blocks from the Port Angeles ferry terminal.\n\n   Several plastic garbage bags containing more than 130 pounds of\ntwo kinds of powder, later identified by the Washington state\npolice crime laboratory as urea and sulfate, as well as two jars of\na yellowish liquid found to be nitroglycerine, were found in the\ntrunk of the car, in the spare tire compartment.\n\n   The car also contained four black boxes, each with a circuit\nboard connected to a Casio watch and a 9-volt battery, apparently\nto be used as timing devices, a government official said.\n\n   Urea and nitroglycerine were two of the main ingredients in the\nbombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.\n\n   Urea is a chemical sold for melting ice and is used in\nfertilizer. It takes more technical skill to make it into a bomb\nthan was employed by the two Americans who killed 168 people in\nOklahoma City in 1995 with a huge but crude bomb made of fuel oil\nand fertilizer.\n\n   The World Trade Center bomb, organized by Islamic radicals, was\nbuilt with a main charge of urea nitrate _ a combination of 1,200\npounds of urea and about 105 gallons of nitric acid, a chemical\nwidely used in industrial etching _ and a booster made of\nnitroglycerine.\n\n   The motel where Ressam made a reservation is a few blocks from\nthe Seattle Center, a complex of public buildings, including the\nSpace Needle, that is to be the site of New Year's Eve\ncelebrations.\n","Headline":"\nMAN STOPPED AT U.S.-CANADA BORDER, SUSPECTED OF TRANSPORTING BOMB\nMATERIALS\n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ A man who officials said brought a car with a trunk\nfull of bomb-making materials on a ferry from Canada, and then led\ncustoms officials on a foot chase through the streets of a\nWashington port town, was arrested by federal authorities, who said\nFriday that his target, his motives and his background remained a\nmystery.\n","\n   The man, who had more than 150 pounds of bomb-making chemicals\nand detonator components in the car, was detained Tuesday just\nafter driving off a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, in Port\nAngeles, Wash.
