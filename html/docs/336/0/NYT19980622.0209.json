(The Science Times)  \n(mk) \n By JIM ROBBINS   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ A new report by two respected\nwildlife biologists warns that the number of grizzly bears in and\naround Yellowstone National Park may be much lower than previous\nestimates.\n\n   Moreover, one of the report's authors, David Mattson, a wildlife\nbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources\nDivision, warns that the outlook for critical elements of grizzly\nbear habitat, including whitebark pine nuts, is poor. ``The odds\nare not good that we will see a stable to increasing population of\nbears over the next 100 years,'' Mattson said in an interview.\n\n   The report, which will be published this year in the journal\nEcology, is controversial, because it runs contrary to the widely\naccepted belief that grizzly bear numbers in the park have\nincreased since the bear was listed as threatened under the\nEndangered Species Act in 1975. And it comes at a time when the\nFish and Wildlife Service says the population is healthy enough to\nbegin the process of removing the bear from the list of threatened\nspecies.\n\n   Mattson began collecting data for the report in 1979. He and his\nco-author, Craig Pease, a zoologist at the University of Texas,\nhave spent the last five years analyzing data. Using a counting\nmethod that differs from past studies, they concluded there has\nbeen little gain in total bear numbers in the last 20 years.\n\n   ``We haven't had as much of an increase in the population as\nmany people would like to think,'' Mattson said. He said that in\n1975 ``the best guess is there were something in excess of 300\nbears.''\n\n   ``At this point,'' he continued, ``we still have something in\nexcess of 300, perhaps as many as 400.'' Further, he said, any\nincreases in the population are the result of fluctuations in food\nsupply and not management of the population, placing the future\nfurther in doubt.\n\n   Mattson said his method does not rely on random sampling, as\npast models have.\n\n   But Chris Servheen, the Grizzly Bear Recovery coordinator for\nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Missoula, Mont., said the\nnumbers are ``totally wrong.''\n\n   ``There are between 400 and 500 bears in the system,'' he said,\n``and we're seeing them in places we've never seen them.\n\n   ``Things are going well now and we should take advantage of\nthat'' by removing the grizzly from the threatened list, he added.\n``If all goes well, we'll propose a status change next year.''\n\n   Some environmentalists fear removing the bear from the list\nwould offer it less protection, allowing, for example, more logging\nand oil and gas development on federal land.\n\n   Servheen, who predicts the bear could be removed from the list\nby the year 2000, expects to release a draft of a document this\nfall that will spell out how the grizzly will be managed by\nMontana, Wyoming and Idaho once the bear is off the list.\n\n   A battle is expected because the bear is one of the most\ncharismatic animals in the American West, and it arouses fierce\nemotions on both sides of the issue. ``De-listing is premature,''\nsaid Louisa Wilcox, a coordinator of the Sierra Club Grizzly Bear\nEcosystem Project. ``It's going to be a classic Yellowstone\nknock-down, drag-out fight.''\n\n   At the core of the debate are the numbers. Grizzly bears are\nsecretive and unpredictable, making a truly random sample extremely\ndifficult. Complicating the issue further is the fact that the\ngreater Yellowstone ecosystem is an ecological ``island'' with no\nlink to other grizzly bear populations. And there are many opinions\non how many bears are necessary to assure long-term survival.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   It is not the present population level alone that concern\nMattson. The outlook for critical elements of the bear's habitat is\npoor on almost every count, he said.\n\n   Whitebark pines are the cause of most concern. Not only are the\nnuts from these trees a critical fall food for the bears, but they\ndraw the bears to higher elevations and keep them in these remote\nplaces, away from people. Conflicts between bears and people are\nthe leading cause of bear mortality in the Yellowstone ecosystem,\nand there is a direct correlation between bad pine nut crops and\nmortality rates, Mattson said.\n\n   A disease called blister rust, which kills whitebark pines, has\nmade its way into areas north and west of Yellowstone, destroying\nmost of the trees. At the same time, some studies indicate that\nglobal warming is causing the range of the pines to shrink.\nMoreover, Yellowstone lost roughly 27 percent of its whitebark\npines in the 1988 fires, and the trees will take about 100 years to\nreplace.\n\n   Global warming may also affect another prime food source, the\narmy cutworm moth. These moths feed on the nectar of high altitude\nflowers at night. During the day, grizzlies find them under the\nrocks in talus slopes. Biologists have seen as many as 50 bears\neating moths at one time. Alpine areas are sensitive to global\nwarming, and there is concern the moth's food source could\ndisappear.\n\n   The shooting of hundreds of bison outside the park by Montana\nlivestock officials could also have an impact on bears. The state\nfears that the bison harbor a disease that could be passed on to\ncattle, and hauls the carcasses away, effectively removing a\ncritical source of protein.\n\n   Damage to the fishery in Yellowstone Lake could also affect the\nbear. Lake trout were discovered in the lake in 1994, probably\nillegally introduced by fishermen. The huge fish prey on the\ncutthroat population which spawns in the lake's tributaries where\nas many as 30 or 40 bears may feed on them. Lake trout spawn in\ndeep water in the lake, and therefore don't provide food for the\nbears.\n\n   Habitat loss may be the single biggest threat to the grizzly.\nThe Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks make up only half of the 6\nmillion-acre grizzly bear ecosystem. In the mix of other land\nownership there are large tracts of private property. Some counties\naround the park are among the fastest growing in the country. Farms\nand homes can attract bears with garbage and dog food, and when a\nbear becomes habituated, or loses its fear of humans, it often\nneeds to be moved out of the ecosystem or ends up being shot. Elk\nhunters who find a grizzly, and shoot it in self-defense, also\naccount for a large share of grizzly deaths.\n\n   Servheen believes that Mattson and environmental groups opposed\nto removing the bears from the list are exaggerating possible\nthreats to food supplies.\n\n   ``He's saying there might be declines, and there might be,''\nsaid Servheen. ``We'll monitor all these foods and have a response\nprotocol.''\n\n   Even if the bear is taken off the list, Servheen said, the three\nstates around the park, the Park Service and the Forest Service\nmust agree to a plan to protect the bear. If numbers drop or a food\nsource seems imperiled, the bear can be placed back on the list.\n\n   ``There's a misperception that de-listing means there's n open\nseason, with timber cutting and oil drilling in the forests around\nthe park,'' Servheen said. ``That's far from the case.''\n","Headline":"\nSCIENTISTS ARE DISPUTING THE FATE OF THE GRIZZLY \n","Text":["\n   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ A new report by two respected\nwildlife biologists warns that the number of grizzly bears in and\naround Yellowstone National Park may be much lower than previous\nestimates.\n","\n   Moreover, one of the report's authors, David Mattson, a wildlife\nbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources\nDivision, warns that the outlook for critical elements of grizzly\nbear habitat, including whitebark pine nuts, is poor. ``The odds\nare not good that we will see a stable to increasing population of\nbears over the next 100 years,'' Mattson said in an interview.\n","\n   The report, which will be published this year in the journal\nEcology, is controversial, because it runs contrary to the widely\naccepted belief that grizzly bear numbers in the park have\nincreased since the bear was listed as threatened under the\nEndangered Species Act in 1975.
