HAYS   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   In documents filed late Thursday, the lawyers for four black\nemployees of Coca-Cola Co., who have filed a lawsuit accusing the\ncompany of discriminating against blacks in pay, promotions and\nperformance evaluations, said they had evidence that Coca-Cola\nexecutives were shredding documents that might be relevant to the\ncase.\n\n   The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Cyrus Mehri, asked U.S.\nDistrict Court Judge Richard Story for sanctions against the\ncompany. He cited a June 23 letter from William Clineburg, one of\nCoca-Cola's lawyers, denying the existence of shredders in a room\nbeing used to assemble documents for the company's defense. In the\nletter, Clineburg wrote, ``No data are being destroyed.''\n\n   Mehri said an anonymous letter he received in June said that\nCoke had set up a ``document destruction room'' to get rid of\ndocuments related to the suit, which is seeking class-action status\nto include as many as 1,500 past or present black employees.\n\n   The suit was filed April 22 in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by\nfour past and current employees. They said that, on average, Coke\npaid its black employees nearly $27,000 a year less than white\nemployees.\n\n   The letter Mehri said he received describes the room as having\n``a 24-hour operation'' and security surveillance.\n\n   According to the motion filed Thursday, Room 7 of the Learning\nCenter was set up with some urgency late in May. Paul Markley, an\nemployee described in court documents as saying he helped set up\nthe room, said another employee, Ginny Sutton, ``requested that a\nshredder be placed in Room 7.'' The motion also cites a custodian\nwho said he removed ``bags of shredded material from outside Room\n7.''\n\n   A Coke spokesman, Ben Deutsch, said in a statement, ``This\naccusation is nothing more than an irresponsible attempt by\nplaintiffs' counsel to seed erroneous information in the public and\nmaliciously attack the integrity and ethics of the company.''\n\n   Deutsch acknowledged there was a room set up as described, but\nsaid no shredding was taking place. ``There has never been a\nshredder,'' he said. ``No discoverable information is being\ndestroyed or altered.''\n","Headline":"\nLAWYERS IN BIAS SUIT ASSERT COCA-COLA SHRED DOCUMENTS \n","Text":["\n   In documents filed late Thursday, the lawyers for four black\nemployees of Coca-Cola Co., who have filed a lawsuit accusing the\ncompany of discriminating against blacks in pay, promotions and\nperformance evaluations, said they had evidence that Coca-Cola\nexecutives were shredding documents that might be relevant to the\ncase.\n","\n   The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Cyrus Mehri, asked U.S.\nDistrict Court Judge Richard Story for sanctions against the\ncompany.
