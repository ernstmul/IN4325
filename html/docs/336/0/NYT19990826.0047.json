Haskins _ nicknamed The Bear _ will\nforever be known as the coach who helped break the color barrier in\ncollege basketball.\n\n   ``You know, after all these years, I still get black players,\ncoaches, people, coming up to me and thanking me for what I did,''\nHaskins said Wednesday.\n\n   During the 1965-66 season, Haskins played his best lineup. That\nhis five best players were black caused a minor stir wherever Texas\nWestern, the school's name then, played. That stir became a vortex\non March 19, 1966, when the Miners played Kentucky for the national\nchampionship in College Park, Md.\n\n   Kentucky was coached by Adolph Rupp, who had consistently\nresisted integration. His lineup was all white. That added a social\ncontext to a game expected to be a blowout. Kentucky was a heavy\nfavorite to win its fifth national championship, partly because it\nwas Kentucky, partly because Texas Western was unknown and partly\nbecause (it was whispered) an all-black team couldn't beat an\nall-white team.\n\n   Texas Western 72, Kentucky 65 caused college basketball to quake\nand change.\n\n   ``More than any other national championship that's ever been won\nby any other coach, that team did more for the sport,'' said\nArkansas coach Nolan Richardson, an El Paso native who played for\nHaskins. ``The significance of that championship will go down in\nhistory to every black as `The Beginning.' Any black person who was\naround at that time, you have to remember 1966.''\n\n   ``Adolph Rupp said that was his best team,'' said Pittsburg\n(Kan.) State coach Gene Iba, a former Haskins assistant and former\nhead coach at Baylor. ``I think it's great people remember him for\nthat. That was one of the great underdog victories of all time.\nThat's a (Jim) Valvano story.''\n\n   And while Haskins will be remembered for that championship and\nits social impact, his legacy also includes longevity and loyalty.\n\n   The native of Enid, Okla., spent his entire career at UTEP _ 38\nseasons.\n\n   ``It's really unbelievable I've been here this long,'' said\nHaskins, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball\nHall of Fame in 1997. ``I don't know what it's like to have\nsomebody get on me. We've had some down times, but I've been pretty\nlucky. I looked at the paper today ... it's like I'm a damn hero.''\n\n   His 719 victories rank 10th on the all-time list. Many of those\nvictories were accomplished with hand-me-down players. Certainly,\nplayers like Nate Archibald, Tim Hardaway, Jim Barnes and Antonio\nDavis were outstanding, but El Paso is a basketball outpost. Of the\n22 top scorers in school history, only eight are from Texas and\nonly two from El Paso.\n\n   ``The closest civilized population (in the United States) of\nmore than 30,000 is Albuquerque and that's 250 miles away,'' Iba\nsaid. ``Dallas is 600 miles away. El Paso is a great town, but\nthat's a tough basketball job. It's a long, hard haul to get\nplayers in there. Don taught those people out there about\nbasketball.\n\n   ``Anybody who coached against him would tell you there was\nnobody they liked to play against less. He would beat you with less\ntalent. His teams were mentally tough because of Don Haskins. He\ncame closer to willing teams to play and win than anybody. He spent\na lot of years pushing rocks up the hill.''\n\n   Haskins played college basketball at Oklahoma A&M under the\nlegendary Henry Iba. While Haskins the player had problems adapting\nto Iba's defense-first-last-and-always system, Haskins the coach\nkept the Iba legacy alive. His teams were hard-nosed,\ndefensive-minded and rarely took a bad shot.\n\n   ``I have always measured every coach against him and none has\nbeen able to compare,'' said Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd, a\nformer UTEP assistant who credits his coaching success to Haskins.\n\n   Haskins had been contemplating retirement since midway through\nlast season. It had been reported that the 1999-2000 season would\nbe his last. But willing another team through a season was not\nsomething Haskins wanted to do.\n\n   ``There's no question that I just sort of got tired of it all,''\nHaskins said of coaching. ``Everybody said there has to be a reason\nfor this, that I'm mad at somebody or somebody's mad at me. Nothing\nlike that. It was just time. I didn't need to be here another\nyear.''\n\n   Haskins, 69, underwent triple-bypass surgery in 1996 after\nsuffering a mild heart attack. This year, he had a pacemaker\ninstalled.\n\n   ``I feel good; my health is not a reason for me making this\ndecision,'' said Haskins, who plans to do some part-time consulting\nwith the Bulls. ``Everybody is telling me I look good. I ran into\nthis 91-year-old fella at the health club and he said there are the\nthree stages of life _ you're young, you're middle-aged and you're\nlooking good.''\n\n   Gene Iba said that Haskins is ``one of the most bashful people\nI've ever known.'' For Haskins' sake, it's good he retired when he\ndid. Now, there won't be a ``Don Haskins Farewell Tour'' around the\nWestern Athletic Conference this season.\n\n   ``Aw, I wouldn't like anything like that,'' Haskins said.\n\n   Haskins was unique. He was a pickup and open-collar shirt guy.\nWe won't see his kind again in college basketball.
