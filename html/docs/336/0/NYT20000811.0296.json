Times News Service   \n\n   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Along the way, the tour guide\npointed out some of the more benign landmarks in this city of Old\nWorld charm and fairly recent terror. To the right was the ancient\nCrown Liquor Saloon; farther on, the gargantuan City Hall. And\nthere, listing a bit, the Albert Clocktower.\n\n   Then Norman Reilly aimed his puttering black taxi west toward\nthe central destinations of his unusual tour: The Shankill Road and\nFalls Road neighborhoods that were the center of the sectarian\nviolence that held this city hostage for the last 30 years. The\nbloodshed has largely subsided, but a whiff of ``the troubles''\nremains _ and tourists excitedly breathe it in. Especially the\nmurals.\n\n   ``We give them options, and most times they want to see the\nmurals,'' said Reilly, a driver for a popular tourism operation\ncalled Black Taxi Tours.\n\n   As peace becomes something more than a breath-holding pause\nhere, the demand for city tours is surging, thanks in part to an\nexplosion of provocative murals in the Protestant neighborhood\ncalled Shankill Estate and, to a lesser extent, in the Catholic\ncommunity along the Falls Road.\n\n   A muse for some of this artistic revival is Johnny Adair, a\nProtestant guerrilla also known as ``Mad Dog,'' who was among the\ndozens of former paramilitaries released from jail in recent months\nunder the terms of the 1998 peace agreement and who now presents\nhimself as the guardian of Shankill spirit.\n\n   ``We might even see Johnny,'' Reilly said as the buildings of\nBelfast blurred past his window.\n\n   Northern Ireland is gradually adjusting to a peace agreement\nthat struggled to establish a new government and has helped to\nperpetuate cease-fires declared by gunmen on both sides of the\nprovince's divide: The mostly Catholic Republicans, who want Ulster\nunited with the rest of Ireland, and the mostly Protestant\nloyalists, who want it to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\n   Part of the story of the peace effort is unfolding on the walls\nof Belfast. The sides of the city's buildings have long served as\ncanvases for those wanting to honor the dead or threaten the\nliving. And for several years, tour guides have been carrying\nvisitors to see the curbs and street lamps painted in the colors of\ndivision: The Union Jack colors of red, white and blue for the\nProtestant neighborhoods, the Irish colors of green, white and gold\nfor the Catholic.\n\n   But now the artwork seems particularly intended to draw the\ngapes of tourists as much as to stir the emotions of residents.\n``They're painted on the walls now for others to see as well,''\nReilly said.\n\n   And with the number of visitors to the city gradually increasing\nto 1.6 million last year, the demand for tours has gone up, said\nMichael Johnston, 27, who started Black Taxi Tours five years ago.\n\n   ``The first couple of years it was on and off because of the\ntroubles and the bomb attacks,'' he said. ``At the time, I was the\nonly one. But because there's a cease-fire on both sides, there's a\nbunch of black taxi crews jumping on the bandwagon.''\n\n   The interest makes sense, said Orla Farren, a spokeswoman for\nthe Northern Ireland Tourist Board. ``The political graffiti is a\nvery symbolic reminder of what's been going on in recent history.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   Reilly turned his taxi into Shankill Estate, its curbstones and\nstreet lamps freshly painted, the light blue flags of the Ulster\nFreedom Fighters _ the outlawed loyalist group for which Adair once\nserved as a commando _ fluttering from every pole and post.\n\n   ``They're a terrorist group, a paramilitary group,'' Reilly said\nmatter-of-factly. ``It's a way of letting people know it's a UFF\nneighborhood.''\n\n   Even more eye-catching were the new murals. One glorified the\nUlster Freedom Fighters by depicting three masked gunmen. Another\nhonored Billy Wright, a loyalist commando killed by the Irish\nRepublican Army in prison in 1997. A third showed a gun-toting Grim\nReaper, standing over the marked graves of three IRA members still\nliving.\n\n   One bore the name of Sean Kelly, another guerrilla recently\nreleased from prison, who bombed a fish shop on the Shankill Road\nin 1993 with the intention of killing Adair and other loyalist\nleaders. It killed nine civilians instead, including a friend of\nReilly's.\n\n   Reilly, 29, is a Protestant from Shankill. Like many who grew up\nin the strongest Protestant or Catholic areas of Ulster's cities,\nhe can remember hearing the cry ``Riot!'' ring through the Shankill\nstreets, and sprinting to watch the brawls between Protestants and\nCatholics. But he said he never did anything more than a bit of\nrock-throwing, avoiding the paramilitary groups whose ranks swelled\nwith his peers.\n\n   After years of doing ``this and that,'' Reilly said, he became a\ntaxi driver who found that his close-up experiences had a value in\nthe marketplace. He eventually joined Black Taxi Tours, whose\nowner, Johnston, said he has purposely employed five Protestant and\nfive Catholic drivers.\n\n   ``We all get along together,'' he said. ``And none of us have a\npolitical criminal record.''\n\n   Suddenly, Reilly pointed to a short man with biceps the size of\nham hocks and a shaved head that glistened in the late-afternoon\nsun.\n\n   ``There's Johnny.''\n\n   Adair, 36, was most recently in the public eye when he, his dog,\nRebel, and dozens of associates all showed up in Ulster Freedom\nFighters T-shirts last month in Portadown, the town 30 miles from\nBelfast that has become the site of an annual showdown over the\ngovernment's refusal to allow Protestants to hold their traditional\nmarch through a Catholic neighborhood.\n\n   The government is now investigating whether Adair provoked any\nof this year's mayhem, which lasted several days.\n\n   Adair rattled some keys and said he had no time to chat, then\nchatted anyway, explaining that several groups, including the\nUlster Freedom Fighters, were working to brighten up the\nworking-class neighborhood in a way that would ``identify our\nBritishness and identify who we are.''\n\n   Nineteen murals are planned for a formal unveiling on Aug. 19,\nhe said. The festivities will include a huge bonfire, which\nexplained why there were stacks of wood on the estate's grassy\ncenter.\n\n   ``It'll be a fun day for kids,'' he said. ``And there's a beer\ntent.''\n\n   He agreed that the Grim Reaper mural conveyed a threat _ ``It\nsays it all; comin' to get you'' _ but added that he had just\nsupported the removal of another, more offensive mural along the\nShankill Road. He also pointed out that there was graffiti in\nCatholic neighborhoods that threatened his life.\n\n   ``Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words will never\nharm me,'' he said. ``It's the bullets I'm worried about.''\n\n   He has survived several assassination attempts and is always on\nguard _ not just against his traditional enemies in the IRA, but\nfellow Protestant paramilitaries, too. Adair displayed a bullet\nscar on his back and one on his skull, the latter inflicted by a\nbullet fired at him in a Belfast park last year, shortly after his\nrelease from jail.\n\n   ``Just there,'' he said, rubbing the area with his finger.\n``Point-blank range.''\n\n   Reilly, who said he takes tourists along this route about four\ntimes a day, drove out of the Shankill Estate and into the\nworking-class Catholic neighborhood called Falls Road. One mural\ndepicted a British soldier under the Gaelic phrase for ``Safe\nHome''; another showed a dove carrying a British soldier away,\nalong with the caption, ``Time for Peace, Time to Go.''\n\n   As he drove up the Falls Road, Reilly pointed out the black\nflags hanging from lampposts to honor Bobby Sands, an IRA bomber\nwho died in 1981 after holding a hunger strike in the Maze prison.\nHe then pulled into Milltown Cemetery, where, in 1988, a Protestant\nguerrilla named Michael Stone attacked an IRA funeral, killing\nthree mourners. Stone was freed last month as part of the\nprisoner-release program, but his attack _ filmed by television\ncameras _ remains a singular moment.\n\n   ``It's something that people cannot forget on both sides,''\nReilly said.\n\n   A little farther on, he pointed out a fresh mural commemorating\n17 people killed by plastic bullets used by British forces.\n\n   ``It's all Catholics on it, no Protestants,'' Reilly said.\n``It's just them getting at the police.''\n\n   Another tour had ended; it was time for Reilly to go home, where\nthe only murals on display are the tattoos that festoon his arms _\nincluding one of a little red devil that bears the name of his\nyoung son.
