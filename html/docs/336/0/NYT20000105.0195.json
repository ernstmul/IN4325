Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ Dr. Steven Handel stood on top of a mountain of\ngarbage, 150 feet above Richmond Creek, and imagined woodlands and\nmeadows rambling over the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island.\n\n   ``This is the biggest landfill in the world,'' said Handel, a\nplant ecologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``But\nyou have to have vision. Imagine this as a developing oak forest.\nOr a stand of red cedars, or a wildflower meadow. With 3,000 acres,\nwe could bring back some plants which are locally uncommon.''\n\n   And maybe make it a park four times the size of Central Park.\n\n   Six years ago, New York City's Sanitation Department hired\nHandel to research the possibilities of reclaiming this vast mound\nof garbage _ where the city's waste has been dumped for 60 years _\nto restore native habitats, like coastal plain woodlands and\ngrassland.\n\n   ``Not some romantic, `Let's bring back the forest primeval that\nHenry Hudson saw,''' Handel said. ``But, `What is possible here?'''\n\n   The natural resources group of the Parks and Recreation\nDepartment has restored the salt marshes along the channels and\ncreeks. Handel and his students are concentrating on what native\nplants might thrive on the mounds of trash.\n\n   Years ago, barges used to bring as much as 27,000 tons of\ngarbage a day here; now they bring about 6,000 tons. And sanitation\nengineers are racing to reduce that stream to zero by Dec. 31,\n2001, the city's deadline for the closing of the Fresh Kills\nlandfill.\n\n   Handel and his students demonstrated the potential of\nrestoration ecology _ the study of rehabilitating devastated\necosystems _ for the Hacksensack Meadowlands Development\nCommission, on 16 acres of the old Kearney, N.J., landfill, as a\npilot for revegetating degraded areas along the New Jersey\nTurnpike.\n\n   And with 6,000 landfills across the country all eventually faced\nwith the problem of what to do after closing, Handel is in the\nforefront of a rapidly growing field in ecology.\n\n   ``People used to think that you had to go to a wild place like\nCosta Rica to do something important in ecology,'' said Handel, who\ngrew up in the honky-tonk, sandy reaches of Far Rockaway, Queens.\n``But now ecologists realize we have to go where people live, to\nprotect the water, the air.'' His scientist's eye flickered at\nsomething up on the mound.\n\n   ``Look! There's a redtail.'' The bird floated over the thick\ngrass of an old covered mound of trash. ``Probably chasing voles.''\nIt's amazing what does survive here, but it's nothing like the\noriginal landscape, when a tidal creek flowed against the terminal\nmoraine, full of oaks, tulip trees, beech and maples.\n\n   But still, on a good day, the estuaries are full of skimmers and\negrets.\n\n   And what a view of Gotham! To the north, the World Trade Center\ntowers shimmered in the haze, the Bayonne Bridge arched over the\nwater to New Jersey. To the west, tugs pulled 600-ton garbage\nbarges from Arthur Kill to Fresh Kill, the Dutch names for the\ntidal estuaries that meander through Staten Island.\n\n   There's a powerful beauty to this wasteland. Hydraulic cranes\nwith huge toothed buckets chomp waste from barges docked on the\nedge of the creeks and drop it onto loading stations, where\nfront-end loaders lift it onto monstrous trucks. From our vantage\npoint, atop an old mound capped years ago, the scene was\nincongruously peaceful. Seagulls fluttered over the garbage barges.\nIt didn't even smell.\n\n   ``There's a lot of care taken by the sanitation crew,'' Handel\nsaid, pointing out the booms stretching into the water to keep\ntrash from straying into the harbor and the fences circling the\ntops of the active mounds to corral windblown litter.\n\n   Giant perforated pipes stuck into the mounds capture methane\nfrom decomposing garbage and funnel it to a boxy-looking recovery\nplant near the West Shore Expressway, where it is cleaned and sold\nto Brooklyn Union Gas Co. (Think of it: you may have garbage\nheating your house.) We looked down on neat windrows of leaves and\nchipped wood quietly composting, piles of concrete and asphalt\nbeing crushed into building materials.\n\n   ``All the kids I bring up here say they'll never look at garbage\nthe same way again,'' Handel said. Two experiments, one financed by\nthe city with $250,000, and the other with $430,000 from the\nNational Science Foundation, are trying to answer key questions\nabout how plants colonize degraded habitats.\n\n   ``The engineers who designed this had one thing in mind,'' he\nsaid. ``To not let the soil erode. So they planted perennial\ngrasses, mowed it and walked away.'' Such areas, costly to mow,\nprovide a pretty sterile habitat for diverse plants and wildlife.\n\n   Handel first experimented with planting clusters of 50 different\ntrees and shrubs up the face of two covered garbage mounds. Some,\nlike wild black cherry and arrowroot, died because they couldn't\ntake the wind and dry, sterile soil.\n\n   nn\n\n   ``So we tried hackberry, gray dogwood and sumac, which can\ntolerate drought,'' he said. ``And those did beautifully.'' But a\ncovered landfill's tough turf does not attract enough birds and\ninsects to disperse seeds.\n\n   So in 1993, Handel and three other ecologists _ Joan Ehrenfeld\nof Rutgers, Jennifer Mattei of Sacred Heart University in\nConnecticut and George Robinson of the State University at Albany _\nbegan a more extensive, National Science Foundation-financed study.\nThey planted 20 clusters of trees and shrubs on a landfill slope\nclose to the West Shore Expressway. Each cluster had the same seven\nspecies, but some had more plants than others.\n\n   Would fewer birds and bees come to the smaller clusters of\nplants? How high would shrubs have to be for fruit-eating birds to\nperch, defecating thousands of seeds to the ground below? How far\ndo such clusters have to be from the oak or maple forest remnants\non the island to benefit from creatures and wind carrying seeds out\nof these living gene pools?\n\n   The idea was to jump-start the succession of plants that occur\nnaturally in abandoned fields. But initial plantings produced\nalmost no offspring, and there was very little germination of new\nspecies, except for invasive types like ailanthus and multiflora\nrose. Theorizing that the thick grass cover discouraged\ngermination, the ecologists cleared a patch of grass next to each\ncluster last August, to see what would take root on the bare\nground.\n\n   ``We know seeds came in by the thousands last fall,'' Handel\nsaid. ``So we'll see what comes up this spring. We want to convince\nthe city to plant different grasses.''\n\n   The soil has to change, too. ``It's not good enough to support a\ndiverse woodland,'' he said. ``That's why the first plantings\ndied.'' About three or four feet of compost would be ideal.\n\n   Phillip Gleason, the city's director of landfill engineering,\nunderstands the need for different vegetation.\n\n   ``Native grasses reinforce the soil better,'' he said. ``They're\nmore drought-tolerant, and they enhance other habitat\ndevelopment.''\n\n   What Gleason and other landfill engineers are most concerned\nabout is protecting environmental controls, like the methane gas\npipes and ground water protection systems. ``Open land is worth a\nlot of money, but you can't build big commercial buildings or\nindustrial facilities here,'' he said. ``The options are limited,\nso that helps protect the environmental engineering.
