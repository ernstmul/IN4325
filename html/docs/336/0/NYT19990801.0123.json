The\npressure around her eyes and ears throbbed all day. Close to\nmidnight, a sudden pressure in her chest grabbed her attention.\n\n   Day had experienced only limited health problems during her 65\nyears. But she instinctively knew something was wrong, and told her\nson to take her to the hospital.\n\n   At Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Wash., a suburb of Seattle,\nshe found out the blood vessels that serve as pathways to and from\nher heart were seriously blocked. The doctors performed a\ntriple-bypass surgery at 7:30 the next morning.\n\n   ``I wasn't thinking it was heart problems because my symptoms\ndidn't seem right,'' Day said. ``I didn't have the pain going to\nthe shoulder and I didn't have the gripping chest pain.''\n\n   Day is one of millions of women who suffer from problems with\nheart disease in the United States. Like Day, many are unaware of\ntheir risks, and unaware that their symptoms can vary from those of\nmen.\n\n   The American Heart Association lists heart disease as the No. 1\ncause of death for both men and women in America. Yet heart attack,\nstroke and other cardiovascular diseases have killed more women\nthan men every year since 1984.\n\n   Until recently, however, heart disease was considered a male\nproblem. Even many medical professionals remained unaware of the\nhigh risk for women.\n\n   Dr. William Hammond of The Hope Heart Institute, a\ncardiovascular disease research center in Seattle, attributes the\nlack of awareness to training and research oversights.\n\n   Reports such as the Framingham Study, a commonly cited report on\nheart disease, focused primarily on early onset of heart attacks\nand heart disease. That almost eliminates women, since the majority\nof heart problems occur in women after menopause.\n\n   In the 45-to-64 age range, 1 in 10 women has some form of heart\ndisease. These odds increase to 1 in 5 women 65 and older,\naccording to the national Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\n   Hammond said awareness of women's risks for heart disease is\nincreasing among medical professionals.\n\n   ``I think in the past five to eight years, doctors are becoming\ndrastically much more aware,'' he said.\n\n   Dr. Sarah Speck, chief of cardiology at Seattle's Swedish\nMedical Center and director of the Dean Ornish Program for\nReversing Heart Disease, said one reason women's risks have been\noverlooked is that their conditions may differ from men's.\n\n   ``I think physicians and providers now know that the risk\nfactors are equivalent in men and women,'' Speck said. ``However,\nwomen's symptoms are different and that's where the level of\nawareness needs to be raised in the public and the medical\ncommunity.''\n\n   Typical signs of a heart attack include: repetitive pressure or\nsqueezing in the chest; shooting pain to shoulder, arms and neck;\nsweating; shortness of breath.\n\n   Women, however, may experience additional symptoms, including:\nstomach pain or nausea, unexplained fatigue, racing heart rate and\njaw pain.\n\n   Additionally, most women do not seek help until two to six hours\nafter the first symptoms, according to Speck. This cuts into\nvaluable time when a patient could be saved or serious damage to\nthe heart prevented.\n\n   Men seek help more quickly because they are more aware of\nsymptoms.\n\n   ``I think women don't complain about their health ailments often\nand they don't seek medical attention as often as they need to,''\nSpeck said. ``If you have the risks ... you need to think of heart\ndisease first.''\n\n   Those risks include a family history of heart disease, diabetes,\nhigh blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and use of oral\ncontraceptives, tobacco and alcohol.\n\n   Women who do suffer from heart attacks are also more likely to\ndie than men. According to a recent study conducted by Yale\nresearchers, 17 percent of female heart attack victims die while\nstill in the hospital; only 12 percent of men do.\n\n   For women younger than 50, the odds are even more skewed. Only 3\npercent of men die and 6 percent of women do.\n\n   Heart attacks among young women are especially rare _ one reason\nthey may be misdiagnosed.\n\n   Corrine DeJong, 28, was watching a high-school basketball game\nin 1988 at Ferndale High School in Ferndale, Wash., when chest\npains grabbed her attention.\n\n   The pains grew sharper. She was having difficulty breathing. The\n17-year-old DeJong ran outside. It was raining and cold, but she\nfelt fiery hot. Sweat poured from her skin. A friend saw DeJong\nleave and followed her.\n\n   Outside the gym, DeJong blacked out and fell to the ground, but\nshe could hear someone say she was going to the hospital.\n\n   At the hospital, the medical staff told her she was fine. DeJong\nsaid one doctor told her she had heartburn and sent her home with\nMaalox. He suggested the reason she passed out was because she was\nflustered.\n\n   ``I was embarrassed because the doctor made me feel like I was\nan idiot,'' she said.\n\n   DeJong's episodes continued with varying frequency and intensity\nfor two years. She went from being outgoing and athletic to\nbecoming a social recluse who couldn't jog to the mailbox without\nher heart racing uncontrollably.\n\n   At times she would experience chest pains or shortness of breath\nseveral times a day.\n\n   After two years of what she calls ``living hell,'' Dr. James\nBrodie of Seattle's Providence Medical Center examined her and\ncorrectly diagnosed her heart problem in just 12 minutes.\n\n   Several tests confirmed DeJong suffered from a heart murmur, an\narrhythmia and a condition called vasovagal syncope, which causes\nveins to constrict and make her pass out.\n\n   The problems are not immediately life-threatening, but life as a\n``normal'' person will never be in DeJong's future. Her heart beats\nfaster than most and she cannot pursue many athletic hobbies she\nused to enjoy.\n\n   DeJong, is small-framed, 5-foot-7 and 125 pounds. Her curly\nbrown hair and bright hazel eyes complement a glowing complexion _\nhardly the typical picture of someone with heart disease.\n\n   ``I'm not your classic heart patient,'' said DeJong. ``I've\nnever smoked, I'm not male, I'm young, I'm not overweight, I look\nfairly healthy, but I am not.''\n\n   She attends massage school and volunteers for the American Heart\nAssociation to help raise awareness of heart disease. She said her\nexperience can help others.\n\n   ``I knew what was going on inside me was not right and I want to\nreach the women whose doctor or boyfriend or family, whoever, is\ntelling them they are all right when they know they are not.\n\n   ``These are the women that stop going to the doctor and those\nare the women who end up dying.''\n\n   Awareness is key to women at risk of heart disease. They can\nreduce the chance of disease by analyzing personal risk factors,\navoiding high-risk behavior and being conscious of danger signs.\nThis can mean everything from eating a healthy diet to asking the\ndoctor the right questions.\n\n   One person who wishes she had asked more questions is Carolyn\nDay.\n\n   ``I realize now I should have been more aware,'' she said.`` I\nwas at risk and I didn't know it.''\n\n   Day paid the price. For six weeks after her surgery, she could\nsleep only on her back. Simple movements were difficult and\npainful. Even sitting down or getting up from a chair was\nexcruciating. The pain in her chest from the massive surgery was\nnumbed by medication that left her in a daze much of the time.\nHowever, by recognizing that something was wrong, she avoided what\ncould have been a serious heart attack.\n\n   Recognizing the behaviors that lead to her problem, Day has set\nout to regain control of her life. Since her surgery in April, she\nhas quit smoking and started exercising. As a patient of a cardiac\nrehabilitation program at Evergreen Hospital Medical Center in\nKirkland, she walks on a treadmill and rides a bike machine.\n\n   She is starting to forfeit some of the meats and cheeses she\nloves and is eating more vegetables.\n\n   As a result of lifestyle changes, Day said she is feeling better\nthan she did before the surgery.\n\n   Tips on lowering risk\n\n   One in 5 women in the United States has some sort of heart\ndisease. Women can lower their risks by:\n\n   _Exercising. Physical activity can strengthen the cardiovascular\nsystem and help control weight, blood pressure, diabetes, and\ncholesterol levels.
