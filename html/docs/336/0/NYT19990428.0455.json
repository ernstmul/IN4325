The anglers favored Power Bait and inflated\nnight crawlers, but little was hitting after the initial hook-up.\n\n   ``We were sitting there relaxing and watching our poles because\nthey were motionless for the longest time,'' Wildason said. ``We\ndidn't have any bites for a while, but when the second one hit,\nwhack, phshh, my pole just flew off. We saw the fish jump but it\nwas hard to tell what size it was.''\n\n   Their tough-luck story would only get worse, but more on that\nlater.\n\n   Parker Lake is indeed home to bruiser browns, with some\nmeasuring to 20 inches or longer; smaller browns and brook trout\nreside in the outlet stream, Parker Creek. While the lake is\nfavored by bait-and-hardware types, it also sees plenty of\nfly-anglers who often work their way up the creek to its source\nusing a mix of dry flies and nymph patterns on 3- to 5-weight rods.\n\n   I carried a fly rod and a bait pole Sunday but was luckless on\nthe creek and blown off the lake by an unrelenting wind that put a\nserious chill on the sun-drenched outing.\n\n   While Parker Lake Trail offers one of the Eastern Sierra's\nearliest backcountry fishing opportunities, it appears it was a\nlittle too soon for much fly-fishing success in the creek. The\nwater remained cold and most of its fish were content to laze\naround in deeper holes or under fallen trees, their cold-blooded\nmetabolisms not permitting any pursuit of the flies presented to\nthem even if they had the urge.\n\n   Nothing worked, from the size No. 16 attractor patterns _ namely\nroyal stimulators and Sierra bright dots _ to deceivers such as an\nAdams, mosquito imitations and emerger nymphs. You could blame my\nfishing prowess, but no so fast; three fly-anglers in my group were\nskunked on the day. One colorful brook was taken on a worm just\nbelow the lake. The lake was worse; flies were useless in the wind,\nand the lures got no attention.\n\n   But like the locals say about the weather in the Eastern Sierra,\nchange comes very quickly, and the fish will undoubtedly be more\nreceptive when the climate warms.\n\n   Braving snow flurries and strong winds a day earlier, Wildason\nand Christiansen got a glimpse of what Parker Lake is like when\nit's on. They landed several nice browns and Wildason took a\nbruiser that he said measured from the ground to just above his\nknee. (For reference, that distance is 24 inches on my leg.)\n\n   But disaster struck again. ``I had it on the stringer sitting\nthere underneath my pole holder, and I went to adjust my pole\nholder and it went vrooo with my stringer,'' said Wildason, who had\na witness in Christiansen but left his camera at camp. ``It was the\nnicest one I ever caught, and it's gone.''\n\n   I wouldn't wish his luck on anyone. At least the anglers count\nthemselves fortunate for finding such a secluded spot, one that\nthey have visited several times.\n\n   ``To get away from the crowds, this is the only way to do it\nnow,'' Christiansen said of such hike-in spots as Parker Lake,\nwhich sits in an impressive basin surrounded by precipitous walls\nof granite. ``It's the best scenery of the lakes in the (June Lake)\nLoop.''\n\n   And, just as fortunately, most anglers, hikers and campers will\nhave an easy time with the mild grade on the 4.4-mile round-trip\ninto the Inyo National Forest and Ansel Adams Wilderness. Waders\nare a great benefit, and packing in a float tube shouldn't be too\nmuch trouble.\n\n   ``Last year I took my young children _ Dillon, 3, and a baby,\nRebecca, in the backpack _ and Dillon was able to walk all the way\nto the lake,'' said Donna Bertolina of Mammoth Lakes, manager of\nthe Mammoth Lakes Visitor Center. ``In the fall it's really pretty\nbecause the aspen trees have orange and yellow leaves. It's one of\nthe best times to go.''\n\n   The region is steeped in cultural _ and controversial _ history.\n\n   Parker Lake was named after some early settlers in the Mono\nBasin.\n\n   For eons Parker Creek fed Mono Lake via Rush Creek.
