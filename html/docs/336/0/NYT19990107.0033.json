No vote was\ntaken; it is uncertain when the commission will again consider the\nChannel Islands fishing-ban proposal. The commission next meets\nFeb. 4-5 in Sacramento.\n\n   The proposal is designed to relieve fishing pressure by\nprohibiting all commercial harvesting and recreational angling\nalong no less than 20 percent of the shorelines of Anacapa, Santa\nCruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, Santa Barbara and San Nicolas islands\nand out to 1 nautical mile. All but San Nicolas Island are found\nwithin the Channel Islands National Park, where fishing regulations\nare enforced by the state Department of Fish and Game. ``No take''\nor ``no harvest'' marine reserves would be established if the\nproposal is approved.\n\n   All factions involved agree this is a difficult issue, but the\nFish and Game Commission is committed to taking some action to\nrestore depleted fishing stocks at the islands just the same. The\nproblem is, no other options have been presented.\n\n   ``We need to try something, and if the no-take zone is the only\nthing to try, then we have two choices _ try it or ignore the\nproblem,'' commissioner Frank Boren said earlier in the week.\n\n   ``The frustration with the commissioners is that we are hopeful\nthat the (fishing) industry and its leaders ... will come forward\nand take a long-range view and tell us what are the other options\nto make the fisheries sustainable in the long term,'' Boren said.\n``And it's not just the fishermen. We haven't seen the Department\n(of Fish and Game) come up with new ideas. And the federal\ngovernment hasn't come up with anything.\n\n   ``We need leadership. We need to have everybody involved agree\nthat we can't ignore the problem. All I have heard is that we need\nmore study; nobody wants to take responsibility. And we need\neverybody to take responsibility for the future.''\n\n   The commission last heard the proposal in October, and, at that\ntime, noted it would gather and assimilate data for six months.\n\n   It takes 90 days after an approval of such a ban for new\nregulations to be enacted, according to DFG officials. Boating,\ndiving, swimming and other forms of recreation, as well as\neducational activities, would not be impacted.\n\n   The proposal was initiated last year by two separate entities _\nthe Channel Islands National Park and the Channel Islands Marine\nResource Restoration Committee, a citizen's panel composed of about\n20 anglers, environmentalists, scientists and other concerned\nresidents of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.\n\n   The petitioners base their arguments on what most marine\nbiologists refer to as the Theory of 20s: By the year 2020, 20\npercent of the world's fisheries must be protected from angling to\nproduce their maximum sustainable yield.\n\n   Translation: ``When fisheries dip below 20 percent of a natural\npopulation then they have a very difficult time recovering from\nnatural extreme events, like El Nino,'' said Gary Davis, senior\nbiologist at Channel Islands National Park. Hence the proposal to\nban all fishing along no less than 20 percent of the islands; exact\nlocations of such reserves have not been determined.\n\n   The proposal has met with strong opposition, most vehemently\nfrom commercial harvesters, who last March staged a peaceful\nprotest at the Channel Islands National Park headquarters in\nVentura that drew 200 people. The vocal detractors claim the state\nis already managing the islands' fisheries and further government\nintervention would only harm the livelihoods of professional\nfishermen who target sea urchin, sea cucumber, squid, lobster,\ncrab, shrimp and a variety of finned species.\n\n   Recreationists have raised other queries:\n\n   When statistics show that most catches of state fish are taken\nby commercial harvesters, why should sportfishermen be included in\nsuch a ban.
