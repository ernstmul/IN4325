Methane gases smolder underground, so much so that\npockets have exploded, spitting fireballs 30 feet into the air.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Anguilla Landfill on St. Croix towers 70 feet\nhigh and is less than a half-mile from the Henry E.

The problem is money. This U.S. territory\nis broke.\n\n   Thanks to mismanagement, hurricane damage and falling tourism\nrevenues, the Virgin Islands government is burdened with at least\n$1 billion in debt, an extraordinary sum for a population of\n110,000 people.\n\n   ``This government has been a notoriously big spender and, at the\nsame time, a poor planner,'' said Adlah Donastorg, chairman of the\nterritorial Senate Committee on Planning and Environmental\nProtection and a critic of the lack of progress in addressing the\nwaste problem.\n\n   A spokesman for Gov. Charles Turnbull, who inherited a budget\ndeficit of more than $100 million, as well as a long-term debt of\n$1 billion, when he took office last January, said the government\nis searching for alternate sites to build landfills but that, so\nfar, no sites have been located.\n\n   He said Turnbull has vowed to chip away at the debt with a\nfive-year ``austerity plan'' to be unveiled by September.\n\n   In the meantime, the three-island chain are saddled with an\nextraordinary amount of trash.\n\n   According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the\nVirgin Islands generate 9.2 pounds of garbage per person per day,\nmore than double the U.S. mainland average of 4.4 pounds.\n\n   Excessive trash is partly the result of day-trippers who visit\nthe islands via cruise ship, as well as all the imported products\npackaged in boxes and crates that must be disposed of.\n\n   But the government has never implemented a recycling program,\nnor has it charged dumping fees at the landfills that might have\nincited residents to monitor the garbage generated.\n\n   All this has left the landfills overwhelmed with garbage, so\nmuch so that they attract birds that can smash airplane windscreens\nand dent propellers.\n\n   The landfill in St. Croix violates Federal Aviation\nAdministration rules that state any site attracting wildlife should\nbe kept five miles from any airport.\n\n   To build a new landfill could cost as much as $70 million,\nexperts say.\n\n   Not a small sum when the Virgin Islands government is struggling\nto pay its utility bills. The debt-ridden U.S. territory owes $16\nmillion for electricity and $17 million for water, according to the\nVirgin Islands Daily News.\n\n   The government can't even afford to maintain its fleet of public\nbuses, forcing locals to take the nicer, but more expensive tourist\nbuses.\n\n   Irate at this, some critics blame the government _ which has a\nbudget of about $466 million _ for mismanaging its money.\n\n   For example, Donastorg said the islands are represented by 15\nsenators, an unnecessarily high number. He said millions of dollars\ncould be saved by cutting the number to nine.\n\n   Other observers say a bigger culprit to blame for the islands'\nfinancial fix -- at least partly -- is a decline in the number of\novernight visitors, and the money they spend.\n\n   For example, in 1994, before Hurricane Marilyn hit, visitors\nspent $919 million. In 1996, after the hurricane, they spent only\n$781 million.\n\n   In addition, the number of overnight visitors to the U.S.\nterritory fell from 555,000 in 1988 to 410,000 last year, a decline\nof 26 percent.\n\n   At the same time the government is being robbed of essential\ntourist dollars, it has spent some $250 million to rebuild on\nhotels and other tourist facilities alone over the last four years.\n\n   ``After Hurricane Marilyn, which damaged 80 percent of the\nislands, we lost quite a lot of business, and it is taking time to\nbuild that business back up again,'' said Beverly Nicholson,\nexecutive director of the St. Thomas/St. John Hotel Association.\n\n   Still, money or no money, Jim Casey, EPA's coordinator for the\nVirgin Islands, insisted that some government action must be taken.\n\n   ``The landfills don't comply with EPA rules,'' he said. ``These\nare really dumps, and not landfills.''\n\n   He said the government monitors what comes in to the landfills,\nbut that the waste is not screened.
