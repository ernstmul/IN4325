The\nanimal was one of a growing group of bears that is pouring down\ninto Western Colorado valleys from the high country, were a\nlate-spring frost and summer drought have killed most of the bear's\nnormal food supplies.\n\n   The Grand Junction office of the Colorado Division of Wildlife\nhas received, on average, seven reports of bear sightings per day\nfor the past several weeks, said district wildlife manager Joe\nGumber. So far this summer his office has tranquilized and\nrelocated 14 bears. In the Roaring Fork Valley, wildlife officers\nhave tranquilized and relocated five bears this summer, including a\nsow and her two cubs, said Pat Tucker, Glenwood Springs area\nwildlife manager for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.\n\n   In Rifle Thursday, the baby bear swam into the muddy Colorado\nRiver from the north bank, nabbed a fish and headed back to shore\nfor lunch while about a hundred people lined the highway to watch.\n\n   ``Everybody's being boneheads,'' said Rifle Police Chief Daryl\nMeisner, trying to shoo people from the scene. ``If they'd quit\nbeing boneheads, the bear would be fine.''\n\n   To Meisner's view, the bear was trapped on two sides by adoring\nhumans and on a third side by the river.\n\n   ``It's already stressed from a lack of food in the high\ncountry,'' Meisner said. ``If it's pressed, it will be more\nstressed. This isn't a zoo bear. This isn't a zoo.''\n\n   That's one of the main problems right now, Tucker said.\n\n   ``The whole situation is turning into a real sight-seeing,\npeople issue,'' Tucker said. ``Obviously it's intriguing, it's\nneat, it's an animal you don't get to see all the time, but people\nare starting to become the problem with their actions. People\nprevent bears from trying to get out of an area.''\n\n   He said in the past week there was an incident of a bear up a\ntree in Aspen with people underneath it throwing rocks at it, and\nof a little girl trying to pet a bear cub at the Grizzly Creek rest\narea.\n\n   The bears, too, are becoming bolder, wandering into busy Grand\nJunction neighborhoods and downtown Glenwood Springs. Thursday\nmorning residents of IHS Mantey Heights nursing home saw a bear\nwalking by their windows.\n\n   ``I was standing at the nursing station when people came running\nup and said I had to look outside,'' said Valerie Tabor, a dietary\nmanager at Mantey Heights. ``I went up the the window and saw a\nbear casually walking along, going up to the canal. Yesterday\nmorning it was in the grassy part right in front of the parking lot\nupstairs, looking in the dining room.''\n\n   Tucker said he is concerned that bears will keep coming into the\nvalleys, and in larger numbers, going into fall because bears start\ncoming from greater distances to historic fall feeding areas.\n\n   ``These are heavy oak brush acorn areas and we're worried that\nthose areas may have gotten a freeze earlier this summer or that\nthe dry weather has prevented the acorns from maturing,'' he said.\n``If bears move into historic fall feeding areas and they don't\nfind anything to eat, they know they've got to find something to\neat because winter time's coming on. That's going to take them into\nwider and wider areas, lower and lower into the valleys where\ntheoretically there's more food, and more people.''\n\n   Tranquilizing and relocating bears that come into populated\nareas and become a nuisance is a last resort, Tucker said. The\nColorado Division of Wildlife currently is focusing on educating\nresidents of areas where bears are coming into, asking them to seal\nup trash, pet food, bird feeders, barbecue grills and other items\nwhose smell attracts bears.\n\n   ``Our time is far better spent getting the problem solved once\nand for all by getting people to make an area less attractive to\nbears,'' Tucker said.\n\n   If a bear is caught and relocated, it gets an ear tag and lip\ntattoo so wildlife officers will recognize it if it comes back into\npopulated areas and becomes a nuisance.\n\n   Bears get two strikes, so wildlife officers recently have had to\nkill several bears on their second strike. Tuesday wildlife\nofficers destroyed a bear that originally was caught Saturday in\nPalisade and on Tuesday came into Silt and became a nuisance,\nGumber said. Wildlife officers from Glenwood Springs have had to\ndestroy two bears so far this summer, one that was captured near\nVail and relocated above Ruedi Reservoir and one that was trapped\nin Aspen, taken south of New Castle and went into New Castle.\n\n   ``We're just inundated with bear issues this summer,'' Tucker\nsaid, ``and we're worried that the problems are going to continue\nand even intensify.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It's fitting that a baby bear would make\nits debut in town on the same day as Rifle High School's\norientation.\n","\n   The Rifle High School mascot is the bears.\n","\n   A hungry baby bear stopped traffic along the bridge leading into\nRifle, as well as along Highway 6 & 24 Thursday afternoon.
