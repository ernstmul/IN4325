Times News Service   \n\n   Q: I'm moving to Europe and wish to take my computer with me.\nWill I have a problem with the computer because of the different\nelectrical standards overseas?\n\n   A: Different European countries have different electrical\nstandards, so find out ahead of time what the voltage and frequency\nrates are for your new home. Most computers of recent vintage,\nespecially laptops, should be able to handle it.\n\n   Most electrical current in the United States operates at 110 to\n120 volts, with a frequency of 60 hertz, while other parts of the\nworld use 220 to 240 volts and varying frequencies (usually 50\nhertz in Europe). Ireland, for example, operates at 220 volts, 50\nhertz.\n\n   If you have a Windows-based PC, check the back of the computer\nfor the voltage switch that leads to the computer's power supply,\ninside the case. You will probably see a switch that will let you\nmanually select either 115 volts for use on U.S. electrical systems\nor 230 volts for use with European standards.\n\n   Apple Computer states that the majority of its Macintosh\ncomputers that were manufactured after the Macintosh SE model in\n1987 are ``universal'' and can handle currents between 100 and 240\nvolts, and 50 to 60 hertz. To determine whether a Mac is indeed\nuniversal, look at the machine's FCC identification label for its\nvoltage requirements, or refer to the technical specifications\nsection of the user's manual. Some Apple machines have a manual\nvoltage selector that allows you to choose 110 or 220 volts.\n\n   Your monitor, printer and other devices may not be so versatile,\nso refer to the electrical specifications in the documentation that\ncame with your equipment. If the country you're moving to uses a\nline frequency other than 50 to 60 hertz, make sure your devices\nare flexible, or ``frequency independent,'' to ensure proper\nperformance. Apple says most of its products are indeed frequency\nindependent, but double-check before using any particular device.\nIf you have lost the manuals that came with your Mac, Apple has a\nsearchable Tech Info Library at til.info.apple.com.\n\n   PCs running Windows, DOS, OS/2 or other operating systems are\nmade by a wide range of different companies, so refer to the\nmanufacturer's technical specs for your machine. Most computer\nmakers will have that information in the tech support area of their\nWeb sites.\n\n   You can get a voltage converter for around $30 to $40. And you\nwill probably also need a plug adapter (or a set of them) for your\nvarious power cords.\n\n   Q: Can I use a different keyboard layout for my computer besides\nthe American one? Is there a system setting to change, or do I have\nto buy a program and a new keyboard to do that?\n\n   A: Both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems will allow\nyou to substitute foreign-language keyboard layouts. For Windows\n98, go to the Start menu, then Settings and Control Panel, then\ndouble-click on the Keyboard icon. Click on the Language tab, then\non Add. Pick your choice from the pop-up list.\n\n   For the Macintosh, go to the Apple menu to Control Panels and\nselect Keyboard. You will see a list of languages. Check the one\nyou wish to use. If you don't see the additional keyboards, you may\nneed to install the files from your operating system's CD-ROM.\n\n   The accents, alphabet and punctuation for many languages,\nincluding Danish, French, Norwegian, Spanish and German, are\nusually readily available. If you need a language that you don't\nsee listed, check with your operating system's maker for additional\nlanguage kits. Appropriate keyboards (or inexpensive letter\nstickers to use with yourU.S. model) are available, and you can\nfind a good supply of foreign-language hardware and software at\nwww.worldlanguage.com.\n","Headline":"\nPAY ATTENTION TO VOLTAGE AND FREQUENCY ABROAD\n","Text":["\n   Q: I'm moving to Europe and wish to take my computer with me.\nWill I have a problem with the computer because of the different\nelectrical standards overseas?\n","\n   A: Different European countries have different electrical\nstandards, so find out ahead of time what the voltage and frequency\nrates are for your new home.
