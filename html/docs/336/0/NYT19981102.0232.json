BROAD and JUDITH MILLER   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   FREDERICK, Md. _ Standing in his study, a waltz playing in the\nbackground, Bill Patrick reached into an old green duffel bag,\npulled out a garden sprayer and pointed out an inconspicuous detail\nat its tip.\n\n   ``That gives it a lot more zip,'' he said.\n\n   Pumping the sprayer vigorously four or five times, he produced a\nlarge cloud of fine particles that hung in the air like fog. He\nsmiled approvingly. His mock attack with deadly germs had gone\nperfectly.\n\n   ``So if I were a terrorist and had a liquid product, I'd choose\nthis sprayer,'' he said.\n\n   How serious is the threat?\n\n   ``It scares the hell out of me,'' replied Patrick, 72, a\ncheerful man who seems haunted by dark visions. ``It's just a\nmatter of time. It's not if. It's when.''\n\n   In ways obvious and otherwise, the United States is fast\nbecoming better prepared to defend itself against the menace of\nbiological terrorism.\n\n   And the thanks, in part, go to Patrick.\n\n   For two decades, he worked for the federal government in secret\nlaboratories behind barbed wire, helping to harness germs for war,\noverseeing ranks of scientists and engineers. He himself holds\nthree secret patents and shares two others.\n\n   After President Richard Nixon ended the offensive program,\nPatrick turned his efforts to finding ways to ward off biological\nattacks from armies and terrorists, foreign or domestic.\n\n   In the deserts of Iraq, working as an inspector for the United\nNations, he helped shatter the wall of deception around Saddam\nHussein's germ warfare program, which had secretly grown enough\npestilential microbes to kill everyone on Earth several times over.\n\n   Patrick has now gone public. Quietly, he has mounted a personal\ncampaign to educate senior government officials, policy experts and\nordinary citizens about the risks of germ terrorism and how to\ncombat it. To do so, he gives talks, writes books and grants\ninterviews, opening a window on the once-secret world of germ\nwarfare.\n\n   This man of dark expertise, a father of two, lives in a\ncomfortable home atop a wooded hill here, surrounded by classical\nmusic, his wife, Virginia, and a small dog named Billy the Kid.\n\n   Patrick loves black humor, and his business card proudly bears a\nskull and crossbones while his consulting firm's stationery is\ntopped with an image of the grim reaper.\n\n   He also likes to shock guests with displays of simulated\nbiological warfare.\n\n   ``It's interesting to get people's reaction,'' he said with a\nmischievous look as he pushed forward a handful of glass vials.\n\n   Just two pounds of such germs, he said, ``can go a long, long\nway in terms of hell and havoc.''\n\n   William Capers Patrick III was born on July 24, 1926. The only\nchild of a produce broker, he grew up in Furman, S.C., a town of\n150 people. He wanted to be an astronomer. But Army service in the\nWorld War II showed him the near miracle of penicillin, just coming\ninto wide use.\n\n   After the war, he went to college eager to cure diseases and aid\nthe new field of antibiotic medicine. He received a bachelor's\ndegree in biology from the University of South Carolina in 1948\nand, a year later, a master's degree in microbiology from the\nUniversity of Tennessee.\n\n   While working for a company in Indiana that made the new wonder\ndrugs, he got a call from an old teacher who had gone to work on\nsecret federal projects. The mentor encouraged Patrick to sign up.\n\n   ``He said, `You'll find this the most interesting work in the\nworld,''' Patrick recalled, adding that it was ``hard to turn down\nyour professor.''\n\n   In 1951, after getting a top-secret clearance, Patrick began\nworking for the Army at Fort Detrick, in Frederick, Md. The base\nwas the heart of the government's secret mission to prepare for\nbiological combat, and work there was expanding rapidly as the\nconflict in Korea escalated.\n\n   Wary of growing communist power, Patrick excelled and quickly\nbecame a team leader, dazzling supervisors with an array of\nachievements, including methods he developed to grow lethal germs\nand freeze-dry them for dispersal.\n\n   By 1965, he was head of ``product development,'' leading about\n80 scientists, engineers and technicians who worked to turn\nbacteria, fungi, viruses and microbial toxins into ``products''\nmeant to kill and incapacitate people in gruesome ways.\n\n   When the military secretly tested the deadly germs in remote\nlocales, Patrick was often the senior Fort Detrick official\npresent. For example, in 1968, he was among those watching as jets\nspread germs over barges, anchored at sea a thousand miles\nsouthwest of Hawaii. The barges were packed with hundreds of rhesus\nmonkeys and guinea pigs, half of which died.\n\n   The American public knew nothing of such tests. But people did\nknow that Fort Detrick was germ central for the military, so\nantiwar protesters of the era often marched outside its gates.\n\n   ``They'd turn their back on you,'' Patrick recalled. ``But we\nthought we were doing the patriotic thing because we were risking\nlife and limb.''\n\n   Indeed, three of his colleagues were accidentally exposed to\ngerm agents and later died. Patrick himself came down with Q fever,\na disease meant to immobilize enemy troops with fevers, headaches,\nchills and coughing.\n\n   In November 1969, Nixon abruptly ended the program.\n\n   Skeptics said he did so to foster an image as a peacemaker.\nFederal experts later attributed the act to pragmatism. Germ\nweapons, they said, were judged superfluous for a state already\nheavily armed with conventional, chemical and nuclear arms.\n\n   Patrick spent the next few years dismissing people and\ndismantling the laboratories and plants he had helped build. ``We\nflooded the market with all these microbiologists, chemists,\nphysicists,'' he recalled. ``It was a real bad time.''\n\n   In 1972, at Washington's urging, most nations renounced germ\nwarfare as immoral and repugnant.\n\n   Fort Detrick went from ``black to white,'' Patrick said.\nSwitching hats himself, he went to work there developing germ\ndefenses at the newly established U.S. Army Medical Research\nInstitute of Infectious Diseases.\n\n   But the switch was difficult. He retired from the agency in\n1986, at 59.\n\n   ``It's a different world,'' Patrick said. ``Defense studies are\nso much more complicated. It takes 18 months to develop a\nweapons-grade agent and 10 more years to develop a good vaccine\nagainst it.''\n\n   ``I was offensively oriented,'' he conceded. ``And that's my\nexpertise today.''\n\n   As history would have it, his dark knowledge became increasingly\nvaluable to the federal authorities in the 1980s and 1990s as germ\nthreats and attacks grew in number.\n\n   In 1985, Patrick helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation\nprove that followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in Oregon had\npoisoned salad bars with salmonella in an effort to keep voters\naway in a local election. More than 750 people fell ill.\n\n   In 1990, as the United States and its allies prepared to force\nIraqi invaders from Kuwait, he helped evaluate the risk of a germ\nattack. Responding to such advice, the American military began a\ncrash program to vaccinate troops against deadly anthrax.\n\n   In 1992, at a secluded spot around Washington, Patrick debriefed\nthe Russian defector known as Ken Alibek, who said that Moscow had\nsecretly produced hundreds of tons of anthrax, smallpox and plague\ngerms, ready to spur Armageddon despite having signed a treaty\nbanning such arms.\n\n   Patrick interrogated him for the Central Intelligence Agency,\ntesting his credibility. ``We got right down to it,'' he recalled.\n``I won't say we fell in love, but we gained an immediate respect\nfor one another.''\n\n   In 1994, Patrick joined a U.N. team to investigate a factory\ncomplex in Iraq spread across seven miles of desert. His\nobservations there helped show that microbe driers ostensibly for\nmaking herbicides were actually meant to produce deadly germs in\nlarge quantities.\n\n   The next year was a turning point. The Iraqis admitted, finally,\nto having undertaken a vast effort to prepare for biological war.\nThe same year, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo released nerve gas\nin Tokyo subways, killing a dozen people and injuring thousands.\n\n   Patrick aided the American authorities in tracking the cult,\nhelping to discover a series of failed germ attacks and learning\nthat the biological assaults were meant to kill millions. A cultist\nlater testified that the sect had even attacked two American naval\nbases near Tokyo.\n\n   In his efforts to raise public awareness about biological\nterrorism, Patrick has taken many routes, some more visible than\nothers.\n\n   He quietly advised Richard Preston, author of ``The Cobra\nEvent'' (Random House, 1997), a novel about a germ terrorist's\nattack on New York City. The book so alarmed President Clinton that\nhe had his intelligence experts assess its credibility.\n\n   Patrick himself is a co-author of ``Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook''\n(Jane's Information Group, 1998), an antiterrorism guide for health\nprofessionals. It discusses germ agents, how terrorists might\nspread them and how to avoid, diagnose and treat illnesses.\n\n   ``Contrary to reports in the lay press, municipal water supplies\nare very difficult to contaminate,'' he wrote, explaining that\n``dilution and diffusion factors as well as chlorination'' weaken\nsuch assaults.\n\n   Patrick's voice is authoritative and at times contentious on\ndifferent kinds of germ defenses.\n\n   He is critical of vaccines, despite a Clinton administration\npush to stockpile them for crises. A smart adversary, he holds,\nwill usually be able to find a way around immunizations, most\nreadily by choosing a different germ or by modifying an old one.\n\n   As a first line of defense, Patrick urges tightening controls on\nlegitimate germ commerce _ an inconspicuous trade that has helped\nscientists study and crush diseases around the globe. But American\ngerm banks have also inadvertently delivered noxious microbes to\nhostile armies and domestic terrorists.\n\n   ``We've got to have better controls,'' Patrick said. ``We've got\nto make it a penalty for these cultures to get out.'' Washington is\nstarting to limit germ sales in the United States, but no parallel\neffort yet exists among the world's 1,000 or so other microbe\nbanks.\n\n   Patrick also criticizes lax security at airports and major\ngovernment buildings.\n\n   He loves to perform his own impromptu tests by dragging bags\nfilled with germ paraphernalia through checkpoints at places like\nthe Pentagon, the State Department and Washington's Dulles\nInternational Airport.\n\n   Grabbing his old green duffel bag, he displayed its jumble of\nsprayers, glass vials, plastic bags and simulated agents _ a\nwitch's brew of biological malice.\n\n   ``Nobody's ever stopped me,'' he said, shaking his head.\n``Nobody's ever stopped and asked, `What's all this stuff?'''\n\n   Perhaps Patrick's most novel enthusiasm centers on strengthening\nmajor government buildings and even individual homes against germ\nattack by adjusting their air flow. He has strongly urged private\nand federal officials to adopt such measures, which are said to be\nplanned for New York City's $15 million crisis control center.\n\n   His idea, which he calls positive pressure, is to bolster\nventilation systems so a gentle breeze blows outward through a\nbuilding whenever a door or window is opened. In theory, this wind\nwould keep the structure safe from dangerous germs by automatically\nsweeping them away.\n\n   ``It's so simple,'' Patrick said. ``As bad as biological warfare\nis, this is an effective way of keeping things under control.''\n\n   Patrick said he had no guilt about his long labors to develop\ngerm weapons, only a sense of foreboding. Terrorist attacks with\ngerms are inevitable, he said. The government is taking a number of\nprudent safeguards and in no way is exaggerating the threat, so far\nas he can tell.\n\n   The big uncertainty, Patrick added, is how severe the attacks\nwill be and whether the United States has the wherewithal to\nprotect itself adequately and defuse the potential harm and mayhem.\n\n   It must try to do so.\n\n   ``We don't have any other option,'' he said.\n","Headline":"\nONCE HE DEVISED GERM WEAPONS; NOW HE DEFENDS AGAINST THEM \n","Text":["\n   FREDERICK, Md. _ Standing in his study, a waltz playing in the\nbackground, Bill Patrick reached into an old green duffel bag,\npulled out a garden sprayer and pointed out an inconspicuous detail\nat its tip.\n","\n   ``That gives it a lot more zip,'' he said.\n","\n   Pumping the sprayer vigorously four or five times, he produced a\nlarge cloud of fine particles that hung in the air like fog.
