Here bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands\nhave become private club dandies; middle-class professionals have\nbeen forced to choose between poverty or criminality; and feigned\nlunacy is a sane way to stay safe. Four lost wars, international\nisolation and gangster economics have combined to make Belgrade\nespecially cruel to the young people who have come of age during\nthe 12-year reign of Slobodan Milosevic.

He\ninvented a style, made it fashionable, applied it to a wide range\nof products, publicised it on a large scale and caused it to be\nhugely influential. If there is such a thing as a Warholian\nmodernity, it resides in his conception of the artist as producer,\ndistributor, publicist and actor rolled into one. Warhol has never\nbefore been given such an effective and representative\nretrospective as the exhibition now on in Brussels, Belgium, until\nSeptember 19.

From Le Monde. 1,500 words.\n(English translation available.)\n_____________________________________________________________ 4.\nTHE TIME FOR WAR IS OVER: AN INTERVIEW WITH GADHAFI Nearly five\nmonths after the United Nations suspended its sanctions against\nLibya, following Libya's belated agreement to turn over two Libyan\nsuspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing for trial in the\nNetherlands, Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has returned to the\ninternational scene. In this exclusive interview, given under a\nBedouin tent in Tripoli, the Libyan leader whistles a somewhat\ndifferent tune than in the past. The time for war is over, he says,\nand now is the time to work on national development. Increasingly\nhe is turning away from his erstwhile Arab comrades and toward\nblack Africa. By Pierre Prier.
