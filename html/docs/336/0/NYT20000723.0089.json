A\npath made of finely crushed oyster shells will run down the middle\nof the 200-foot-long span.\n\n   The $3.2 million elevated nature trail will re-connect two\npieces of the Cross Florida Greenway that were split 30 years ago\nby highway construction.\n\n   By day, hikers, bicyclists and horseback riders will once again\nbe able to traverse the 110-acre recreation and conservation area\nwithout having to stop for a speeding car or truck.\n\n   In the dark of night, deer, foxes and possums can scamper across\nthe bridge to avoid becoming roadkill.\n\n   The ``land bridge'' _ the first ever built in the United States\n_ is the latest example of efforts by state and federal\ntransportation departments to protect wildlife along highways and\nlink fragmented natural areas.\n\n   In the past decade, special crossings have been built for\nFlorida panthers on Alligator Alley and State Road 29 in southwest\nFlorida and for black bears on SR 46 in north central Florida.\n\n   Plans are in the works to build additional bear underpasses\nalong roadways in the Wekiva River Basin northwest of Orlando and\ncrossings for deer along U.S. 1 in the Florida Keys. Work will\nbegin next year on a second land bridge along I-95 in Flagler\nCounty to join the Florida Agricultural Museum with the Princess\nPlace Preserve.\n\n   The bridge just south of Ocala sits on land where the Cross\nFlorida Barge Canal was once envisioned. Construction of the canal\nbegan in 1935, but was stopped a year later because of a lack of\nmoney. Work resumed in 1964, but a series of lawsuits that claimed\nthe project would destroy natural habitats led to its demise in\n1990.\n\n   ``We took something that was environmentally unsound and was\ngoing to destroy nature and turned it back into something good,''\nDOT project engineer Alan Bryant said.\n\n   But wildlife advocates and environmentalists say much more needs\nto be done in planning new highways and rebuilding old ones to make\nthem more environmentally friendly. Roads should not run through\npreserve areas, they say, but if there is no other alternative\nroads should be built on pilings to cause the least disruption to\nwildlife in their natural environment.\n\n   ``If we don't do it right at the outset, we're going to pay in\nthe future with the loss of important, significant resources,''\nsaid Laurie Macdonald, state representative for Defenders of\nWildlife, a national, nonprofit conservation organization. ``I\ndon't think there's too many places in the state where you can go\nwhere there are no roads.''\n\n   LOSS OF BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL LIFE\n\n   Each year, millions of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds\nare killed on the nation's highways while looking for food or\ntrying to reach mating or nesting sites. Many are slow-moving\ntortoises and snakes that aren't as popular as endangered species,\nlike the panther and black bear, but an important part of regional\necosystems.\n\n   The problem also affects motorists' safety. More than 200 people\nare killed and thousands injured annually in vehicle collisions\nwith animals, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n\n   Public awareness of the need to blend wildlife conservation into\ntransportation projects has increased significantly in the past few\nyears, according to federal ecologist Paul Garrett. The $218\nbillion Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21,\napproved by Congress two years ago provides $3 billion to states\nfor environmental enhancements. ``Critter crossings'' were added as\nan eligible improvement, Garrett said.\n\n   In California, scientists are studying how desert tortoises use\nstorm drains to move under a highway in the Mojave Desert.\nResearchers in Massachusetts are monitoring how roadway tunnels aid\nspotted salamanders on their annual migration.\n\n   ``Florida is one of the states that has been very active in this\narea,'' Garrett said.\n\n   One of the more innovative projects is located at the Paynes\nPrairie State Preserve near Gainesville. Thousands of animals from\n80 different species were killed every year on a 2-mile stretch of\nU.S. 441 that runs through the preserve.\n\n   A 3.5-foot wall with a 6-inch lip at the top _ similar to walls\nin zoo serpentariums _ prevents animals from reaching the highway.\nAnimals move along the wall to one of eight underpasses.\n\n   ``If you do the studies up front to know where to place the\ncrossings, wildlife will use them,'' said state ecologist Gary\nEvink. ``I think people see enough dead animals along the roads to\nrealize this is something we need to be concerned about.''\n\n   BLENDING INTO NATURE\n\n   The land bridge on I-75 in Marion County was modeled after\nwildlife overpasses in the Netherlands called ecoducts. The\necoducts link natural areas that were split by highways and are\npart of migratory routes for moose and other wildlife.\n\n   State officials said they went to great extremes to give the\nbridge a sense of ``natural connectivity'' so it blends into the\nsurrounding area.\n\n   Stones covering the walls were gathered from horse farms around\nOcala. Mature pines and oaks aren't found in plant nurseries, and\nsome of the trees are being imported from Arizona, said the DOT's\nBryant.\n\n   ``I suspect quite a few animals will use it, if they have a\nstrong urge to get across the highway,'' said Dave Bowman, a\nwildlife biologist at the state Department of Environmental\nProtection\n\n   But MacDonald of Defenders of Wildlife said it's too early to\ntout the bridge as an environmental success. MacDonald said she\nwonders if animals will use the same path tromped on by humans.\n\n   ``That's not to say it won't work,'' she said. ``It may be\ntrying to serve too many purposes, but I give a lot of credit to\nthe people in the state who are trying to do these things.''\n\n   State environmentalists are sure it will work. Workers building\nthe bridge said they've already found animal tracks.\n\n   ``I hope there are skeptics so we can prove them wrong,'' Bryant\nsaid.\n\n   The 36 panther crossings on the western end of Alligator Alley _\nthe highway connecting Fort Lauderdale and Naples _ cost about $20\nmillion. They were put in more about 10 years ago as part of a $350\nmillion road widening project.\n\n   At each crossing, the road was raised or a bridge was built over\na low spot, creating an 8-foot-high, 120-foot-wide pathway for the\npanthers and other animals. Fences along the road direct animals to\nthe crossings. Before the work was done, biologists monitored the\npanthers' movements with radio-tracking collars and put the\npathways where the animals usually crossed the road.\n\n   No panthers have been killed or injured on Alligator Alley or SR\n29 since the crossings were installed, according to Darrell Land, a\nresearch team leader with the Florida Fish and Wildlife\nConservation Commission. Before that, several panthers were killed\nor injured each year on the two roads, Land said.\n\n   State engineers and biologists followed a similar plan to design\nthe black bear underpass on SR 46 in Lake County. The 8-foot-high,\n24-foot-wide dirt-floor tunnel was put at the spot where bears were\nmost often hit by cars while crossing the highway.\n\n   The state spent about $3 million to buy 40 acres of\nprivately-owned land in the bears' travel corridor to put in the\ncrossing, Evink said. So far, no bears have been hit near the\ncrossing, he said.\n\n   The bear underpass is ``a great first step,'' but the state\nneeds to build additional crossings along the road which runs\nthrough the Ocala National Forest, said Jennifer McMurtray, the\ntransportation and wildlife ecology coordinator for Defenders of\nWildlife. State officials said another $4 million to $5 million is\navailable over the next few years for additional bear crossings in\nthis area.\n\n   Also, a 1.5-mile stretch of the road in the most\ndensely-populated area of the preserve should be raised, McMurtray\nsaid. Highway officials said that's too costly.\n\n   ``The underpasses are great for big animals like bears, but the\naverage snake or mouse is not able to travel four miles to cross\nthe road safely,'' McMurtray said.\n\n   JOINT EFFORT OF STATE AND UNIVERSITY\n\n   DOT officials have been working with University of Florida\nscientists to develop a set of guidelines to use in deciding where\nto build future wildlife crossings and bridges.\n\n   A geographic information system lets transportation planners\nidentify roadkill ``hot spots'' around the state. As well, UF\nresearchers are conducting field studies to evaluate the usefulness\nof existing crossings.\n\n   The state will only build crossings that connect publicly-owned\nland, Evink said. ``We don't want a McDonald's or a housing\ndevelopment popping up next to a wildlife crossing,'' he said.\n\n   Both environmentalists and highway officials admit there is so\nmuch more they can learn about the problems associated with\ntransportation and wildlife.\n\n   ``We're just beginning to understand what we need to do to in\nplanning roadway projects and we ought to be implementing better\nplans,'' MacDonald said. ``It's not good for people in cars to hit\nanimals on the road.''\n\n   The Federal Highway Administration has sponsored three\ninternational conferences on the topic and a fourth meeting is\ntentatively planned for next year. Last year's conference in\nMissoula, Mont., brought together more than 300 people to share\ninformation on various solutions, both those that been successful\nand those that have have failed.\n\n   Administration ecologist Garrett said despite the gatherings,\n``I don't think we'll ever get to the point where we prevent all\nwildlife mortality.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ On a busy stretch of Interstate 75 near Ocala, Fla., a\npiece of man-made wilderness is rising above the highway.\n","\n   When it opens in September, a 17-foot-high and 52-foot-wide\nbridge will be lined with native oaks, pines and saw palmettos.
