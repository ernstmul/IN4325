There\nshould be more give and take, Giuliani suggested, a call for a\n``reciprocal relationship'' that fell on many deaf ears in\nVirginia.\n\n   How about a different tack?\n\n   If Virginia and other states refuse to help out, why not impose\na garbage-handling fee on the 32 million visitors a year to the\ncity? You could start with a small surcharge, say, $3 a day, on\neach of the city's 60,000 hotel rooms, which are filled these days\nalmost to capacity.\n\n   Three dollars would entail no hardship for guests already paying\nclose to $200 a night on average. But the fee could produce about\n$65 million, roughly 10 percent of the Sanitation Department's\nannual budget.\n\n   True, it does smell like a new tax, which may cause the mayor to\nwrinkle his nose. In that case, to return to the idea at the top,\nwhy not make visitors cart their garbage home?\n\n   Trash bags could be handed out at airports and train stations,\nwith prominent signs informing arriving out-of-towners what is\nexpected of them. Since most Americans consider themselves more\npolite and, over all, more virtuous than New Yorkers, they could be\ncounted on to comply.
