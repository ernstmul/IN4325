Bedard scored 24 points, but only 5 in the first half\nwhen Delaware took control. ``It probably had as much to do with\nDelaware,'' said Giannini. ``We just didn't have an answer for what\nthey were doing.''\n\n   Delaware, which has won 12 straight and nine straight by 13 or\nmore points, had lots of answers Sunday.\n\n   It got them from league MVP Mike Pegues, who poured in a\ngame-high 32 points and dominated early; Maine transfer John\nGordon, who ran the offense and also scored 18 points; and center\nJohn Bennett, who was instrumental in frustrating Fox all\nafternoon.\n\n   ``Frustrating was the best way to describe it,'' said Bedard,\nwho was unable to stop the constant Delaware attack that produced a\n43-30 halftime lead that climbed to 30 before the Black Bears cut\nit down to the final margin. ``I was just terrible in the first\nhalf. We just made so many mistakes and got ourselves into a\nhole.''\n\n   Delaware can do that. It has done that except for one stretch in\nmidseason when it lost three of four.\n\n   ``We've been pretty good all year,'' said Delaware coach Mike\nBrey. ``Today we were very ready to play again. We're pretty good\noffensively. We know how to use our offensive weapons.''\n\n   Giannini was even more effusive. ``They play the game as well\ntogether as any team in America,'' he said.\n\n   If Delaware is playing in its own building, at its own tempo, no\none could argue with that assessment.\n","Headline":"\nMAINE LATEST NEW ENGLAND FALL GUYS \n","Text":["\n   NEWARK, Del. _ Now the fall is complete.
