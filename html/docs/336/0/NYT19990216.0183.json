Gen. Richard A. Coleman, the Air Force\nSecurity Forces Center commander and a Vietnam veteran.\n\n   ``And today this event recaptures some of the dedication and\nsacrifice that some of those guys made, because Mr. Coggins here\nwas the only guy to come out of that bunker alive,'' Coleman said.\n\n   The battle for the Tan Son Nhut Air Base just northwest of\nSaigon began around 3:30 a.m. Jan. 31, 1968, as a force of more\nthan 1,500 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong waded into a smaller\ngroup of Americans.\n\n   Troops with the 377th Security Police Squadron had been placed\non red alert only hours earlier after Lt. Col. Billy Jack Carter\nand then-Maj. Carl Bender agreed that an attack was imminent.\n\n   ``I felt they were going to sucker us into something,'' Bender\nsaid.\n\n   Over the next eight furious hours of battle, Bunker 051 would be\na vortex of violence, with Coggins first fighting, then playing\ndead.\n\n   The 21-year-old airman was manning the bunker with four others\nwhen the North Vietnamese broke the annual holiday truce by\nlaunching the huge Tet offensive.\n\n   Coggins said enemy troops opened the battle with mortar rounds,\nblasting a nearby bunker.\n\n   ``You could see and hear them as they walked across a rice\npaddy,'' he said. ``It was scary, very scary. You were in a fixed\nposition. What could you do?''\n\n   Coggins and his men fought back and radioed information that\nhelped commanders launch a counterattack. They battled until the\nbunker was hit by enemy rocket fire, killing everyone but Coggins.\n\n   With enemy troops using captured American weapons and a\nstorehouse of ammunition in the bunker, Bender made the tough\nchoice to direct an airstrike on the position.\n\n   ``It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made in my\nlife,'' said Bender, a 69-year-old retired lieutenant colonel who\npresented Coggins with a U.S. flag during Friday's ceremony. ``I\nhad to assume they were all dead.''\n\n   That was a reasonable assumption for Tan Son Nhut survivors Bob\nOtt and Pat Bowden. The Americans were outgunned and outmanned, but\n``also fought better,'' said Bowden, a retired Air Force chief\nmaster sergeant living in San Antonio.\n\n   ``Maybe we were luckier, too,'' added Ott, then a 28-year-old\nstaff sergeant now living in Sacramento, Calif.\n\n   Scarred by metal fragments that broke through his face for more\nthan 20 years after that battle, the crafty Coggins played dead and\nprayed.\n\n   ``It's a total God's miracle that man is alive today,'' Ott\nsaid.\n","Headline":"\nVIETNAM VETERAN HONORED FOR ROLE IN KEY BATTLE \n","Text":["\n   SAN ANTONIO _ Thirty-one years after the Tet offensive in\nVietnam, Air Force veteran Alonzo J.
