Star-Tribune   \n\n   There's a movement afoot to create a 3.2-million-acre national\npark in Maine that extends from Umsaskis Lake and Priestly Mountain\nin the north to Sebec Lake and Monson Pond in the south. The\nwestern-most boundary is Quebec Province, Canada and Green Mountain\nto the east. The proposed national park lies about 40 miles north\nof Bangor.\n\n   The Baxter State Park will be entirely surrounded by the\nproposed national park, but it will remain a state-run park. In\n1919, former Maine Rep. and later Gov. Percival Baxter attempted to\nsecure state protection for the Mt. Katahdin area. He was\nunsuccessful. So, he purchased the land with his own money and\ndonated it to the people of the state of Maine as the ``forever\nwild'' state park.\n\n   Conservationists from around the nation see this as a last\nchance to save the famed North Woods. Jym St. Pierre, the Maine\ndirector of RESTORE: The North Woods, the regional conservation\ngroup which has proposed creating the national park, wrote\nrecently, ``Establishing a Maine Woods National Park would\nsafeguard a national treasure where the haunting yodel of loons\nechoes through the warm, blue summer air. It would give us an\nopportunity to restore the legendary forests of Maine, the song of\nthe wolf, the splash of the Atlantic salmon, the magic of caribou\ngliding through wild woods like massive, mysterious shadows. It\nwould be a magnificent people's park for the Twenty-first Century\nand a fitting millennial memorial for future generations.''\n\n   St. Pierre isn't the first person to wax poetic about this area,\nHenry David Thoreau, after his visit in 1853, declared that it\nshould be saved as a national preserve. Thoreau, in his book ``The\nMaine Woods,'' a profound study of woods and camping, wrote: ``From\nthis elevation, just on the skirts of the clouds, we could overlook\nthe country, west and south, for a hundred miles. There it was, the\nState of Maine ... immeasurable forest for the sun to shine on ...\nNo clearing, no house.\n\n   ``It did not look as if a solitary traveler had cut so much as a\nwalking stick there. Countless lakes ... and mountains also, whose\nnames, for the most part, are known only to the Indians. The forest\nlooks like a firm grass sward, and the effect of these lakes ... is\nthat of a mirror broken into a thousand fragments, and wildly\nscattered over the grass, reflecting the full blaze of the sun.''\n\n   At present, there is a great opportunity to purchase some of the\nland necessary to create this national park. Approximately 5\npercent of Maine is currently up for sale. Two major paper\ncompanies, Sappi Ltd. and Bowater Inc., are offering to sell nearly\nthree million acres of forest land, which constitutes 17 percent of\nthe forested area in Maine. A number of state conservation groups\nare attempting to arrange a package to buy Sappi land.\n\n   Those who wish to preserve these lands as a national park have\nto overcome the reluctance of politicians and local residents who\nsee the timber industry as the backbone of Maine's economy. And\nthere are those who fear that if this stretch of land becomes a\nnational park, they won't be able to hunt or fish or use\nsnowmobiles in the park. They worry that they will lose access to\nthe land.\n\n   The tourists who are attracted to Maine now will increase\ntenfold if this national park is created. And nearby towns will\nreap greater economic benefit from the park than they have from the\ntimber industry.\n\n   The people of America hunger for more wilderness and greater\ntracks of land that preserve nature: the wildlife, the streams and\nrivers, the forests and undergrowth, the deep silence and sense of\nconnection to the earth we need to escape the pressures of work and\nthe busyness of life.\n\n   Many years ago, former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O.\nDouglas wrote, ``Nature must be left undisturbed in ever-widening\ncircles, so that she can heal the wounds of civilization and\nre-create the wonders of God's wilderness.''\n\n   ``Heal the wounds of civilization.'' Yes. How often we seek the\nsolace of the wilderness. The wonder of a massive, 750-year-old\nSitka spruce on the Oregon coast that has survived numerous\nlightning strikes _ yet bares their scars in deep, jagged cuts\nthrough its bark. The quiet that the deep foliage brings, the red\nof rotting tree trunks, the green canopy of leaves, the light\nshimmering green to complement the red wood slowly turning to soil.\n\n   Who among us has never felt the sanctity of the wilderness? Who\nhas not felt cleansed by walking through a forest hearing the wind\nsing through the branches and leaves, the pines and firs? Or\ncleansed by lying down beside a river so the purling waters hush\nthe din of civilization we carry within ourselves?\n\n   Now is the time to secure the great North Woods of Maine. The\nMaine Woods National Park would rival the Yellowstone National\nPark, which so many of us cherish. The nation's economy has created\na windfall of taxes for the federal government. And here is a\nworthy investment for this nation's future _ purchase the land\nnecessary to make the proposed Maine Woods National Park a reality.\n\n   There is no better way to spend a small portion of the nation's\ntax dollars. The entire purchase will cost less than we taxpayers\npay for a B-2 bomber. And one never has to worry about a wilderness\narea becoming obsolete.\n","Headline":"\nLET'S PURCHASE LAND TO CREATE MAINE WOODS NATIONAL PARK \n","Text":["\n   There's a movement afoot to create a 3.2-million-acre national\npark in Maine that extends from Umsaskis Lake and Priestly Mountain\nin the north to Sebec Lake and Monson Pond in the south.
