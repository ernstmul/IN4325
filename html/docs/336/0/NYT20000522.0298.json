The campers\nthen took pictures, not sure if this was a disaster or the most\namazing thing they had ever seen.\n\n   In the past week in Yosemite Valley, eight more vehicles were\nbroken into by bears and there were another 12 damage reports from\ncampgrounds. So far this spring there have been 117 bear incidents\nalready at Yosemite, resulting in $32,871 in property damage, most\nof it to cars.\n\n   There have been no injuries. You see, the bears are not\ninterested in you. They just want your food. And too often, they\nare getting it.\n\n   As spring arrives in the alpine zone, Yosemite Valley becomes\nthe greatest showpiece in North America, as snowmelt turns\nwaterfalls into silver-tasseled ribbons against the eye-popping\ngranite canyon walls. Meanwhile, like something out of P.T. Barnum,\nit's like the Yosemite bears are in a three-ring circus in the\nparking lots and campgrounds.\n\n   Wild bears are supposed to eat grass, budding leaves and\ninsects, and perhaps carrion if they come across it as they emerge\nfrom their winter sleep. Except in Yosemite, bears have learned\nthat Tang, butter and candy taste a lot better. The worst-case is\nwhen campers don't use bear-proof food lockers, or visitors leave a\nbags full of goodies in their parked cars, allowing momma bear a\nchance to teach her cubs the tricks of food-raiding. The cubs learn\nfast, and as those cubs smarten up and become adults, another\ngeneration of bears will prefer Hostess cupcakes to carpenter ants.\n\n   To try to stop this cycle, campers are now required to use\nbear-proof food lockers, and in the coming summer, those heading\ninto the Yosemite wilderness are required to use bear-proof food\ncanisters when above 9,600-foot elevation. Violators will be\nticketed and fined. In addition, visitors are advised to report any\nsituation where a bear is trying to reach human food: Phone the\nSave-A-Bear Hotline at (209) 372-0200 (press 2, then 4).\n\n     \n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)   \n\n    \n\n   For many visitors, seeing a bear validates the vacation, and\nthere is often no better place to do that than Yosemite. Another\ntruth, though, is they are a side show, not the show itself.\n\n   And the big show is just starting. After the surprise storm last\nTuesday dumped 18 inches of snow on the Sierra crest, ensuing warm\ntemperatures are defrosting the high-country deep freeze. In turn,\nsnowmelt is flooding crevices, flowing down canyons, into streams,\nand straight to Yosemite Valley. Eventually it reaches the brink of\nthe canyon, creating some of the most dramatic waterfalls in the\nworld.\n\n   Driving into the valley, the first sight of Bridalveil Falls\n(620 feet) on the South Wall can take your breath away. Yet it\nseems that every fissure of rock has water running down it right\nnow, as if it is a giant waterfall park, and it will continue like\nfor at least the next six weeks during peak snowmelt.\n\n   The road up to Glacier Point opened last week, and with spring\narriving to the alpine zone, this may be perhaps the most stellar\nlookout in North America.
