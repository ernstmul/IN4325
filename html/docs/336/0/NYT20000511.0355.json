Times News Service   \n\n   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Fed by winds gusting at up to 50 miles an\nhour, a wild fire here resumed its path of devastation on Thursday,\nforcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying\nat least 150 homes, perhaps twice that number, but apparently not\ncausing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where\nnuclear weapons are designed.\n\n   As officials warned that there was still little chance of\nbringing the blaze under control until the weather changed, a\ngrowing chorus of local and national officials began to express\ntheir anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had\nhoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent\nit racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.\n\n   As reports circulated here that the National Weather Service had\nwarned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the\nInterior Department, which operates the park service, announced\nlate in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the\nBandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, was placed on\nadministrative leave pending an investigation.\n\n   ``I believe someone is responsible,'' Sen. Pete Domenici,\nR-N.M., said at a press conference here on Thursday morning. ``The\nperson in charge at the park service who authorized the burn is\nmost responsible.'' He added that he intended to ask for a federal\ninvestigation of the plan.\n\n   Although more than 18,000 acres have already burned and more\nthan 1,000 emergency and fire personnel have been brought in to try\nand control the fire, there have been no injuries reported and the\nhasty evacuation of the huge number of people was described as\norderly.\n\n   But Los Alamos presented a disconcerting tableau on Thursday,\nduring a reporter's visit to the blackened streets. Fire vehicles\nrushed about, the skies dark with thick plumes of white smoke and\nhelicopters occasionally whirring overhead, carrying huge buckets\nof water. Most neighborhoods presented an eerie checkerboard of\ndestruction, with houses seemingly selected at random for total\ndestruction alongside other homes left unscathed.\n\n   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who flew in from a conference\nin San Diego on Thursday morning, said that the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory had suffered some fire damage but was secure. He added\nthat there were no signs that any radiation had been released and\nthat the modest amount of radioactive materials stored at the lab _\nno nuclear weapons are kept there, he said _ was in bunkers that\nwere far from the fire.\n\n   John Brown, the lab's director, said that the government\nmaintains numerous sensors at the lab to detect any release of\nradiation. He said the sensors were still working and that nothing\nhad been detected. The government said later that it was bringing\nin additional detectors to place around the region to insure that\nany releases are caught quickly.\n\n   Initially, just the 11,000 or so residents of Los Alamos, a tidy\ntown high on a mesa at about 7,200 feet, had been evacuated. But\nstarting on Wednesday night and then throughout the day on Thursday\nthe residents of the nearby towns of White Rock and the Espanola\nValley, as well as Abiqui, were told to leave the area. Abiqui is\nfamous for having been the home of Georgia O'Keefe, the artist, for\nmany years and much of her work is still kept there.\n\n   A local radio station took calls from people all day who\nrecounted having been given just minutes to clear out of their\nhomes. Many said they had had time to do little more than throw\nsome clothes into plastic garbage bags, grab their pets and\nchildren and flee, with the smoke and flames visible nearby. One\nman called in to ask if any of the authorities had information\nabout his two dogs; he had not had time to bring them in before he\ndeparted in haste on Wednesday night.\n\n   The streets of Los Alamos were a crazy quilt of random\ndestruction. The heat of the fires transformed many houses, cars,\nutility poles and lawns into cinders.
