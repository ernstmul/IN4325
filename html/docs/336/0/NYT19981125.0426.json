(bl)  \n By GERALD ESKENAZI   \n c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    \n\n   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bryan Cox, believed to be the most heavily\nfined player in pro football history, has been on his best behavior\nsince joining the New York Jets in August and, as a result, had\nbeen enjoying a fine-free season.\n\n   But the National Football League fined Cox $10,000 Wednesday for\nunnecessary roughness during the Jets' victory last Sunday in\nNashville, and afterward he lashed out, accusing the league of\nracism.\n\n   Cox, who is black, used the words ``tokens'' and ``house\nNegroes'' in discussing two black NFL officials _ Gene Washington,\nthe director of football operations, who handed down the fine, and\nHarold Henderson, the labor relations director.\n\n   ``With this league being over 70 percent black, and within the\nleague office all the black people that are in any position of\nauthority are always pitted against the players in the league,''\nCox said. ``I feel like that's unfortunate, and I don't like\nthat.''\n\n   Cox, a linebacker, was not penalized for either of the plays for\nwhich he was fined Wednesday. Both involved hits with his forearm\nin the second quarter, one to the head of Oilers quarterback Steve\nMcNair and one to running back Eddie George.\n\n   The latest fines bring Cox's career total to at least $146,000.\nThey marked only the second time in his career that Cox has been\nfined for his play _ the other fines had to do with actions away\nfrom play involving fans or officials, or fighting.\n\n   Cox says he has been fined more than $200,000 in a career that\nbegan in 1991, but published records show a total of $146,000. The\nNFL has fined him $136,000 and he was also fined at least once, for\n$10,000, by the Bears, his previous team. He was not fined by the\nDolphins in five seasons in Miami.\n\n   Cox conceded that he was wrong on the hit against George, but\ndefended his actions against McNair, a scrambling quarterback who\nhad just run for 17 yards. ``I was trying to tomahawk the ball, and\nwhen I swung, he slid and his head went where the ball was,'' Cox\nsaid.\n\n   Cox, initially low-keyed as he discussed the fines at his\nlocker, then took on the league. That is not unusual _ Cox has\nalready filed two lawsuits against the NFL.\n\n   One of his complaints Wednesday was that he is unable to\ndesignate the charities his fine money goes to. Cox said he wanted\nit to go to a youth center founded by Jackie Joyner-Kersee in his\nnative East St. Louis, Ill.\n\n   Cox complained that there was no predominantly black charity\nthat receives fine money. By a 1993 agreement with the Players\nAssociation, the money is split among four charities, two chosen by\nthe league and two by the union. The league gives the money to\ncancer funds named for Vince Lombardi and Brian Piccolo while the\nplayers group chose a Lou Gehrig's disease charity and another that\nhelps needy former players. Before the 1993 agreement, the money\nwent solely to the cancer funds.\n\n   Coach Bill Parcells, who rescued the 30-year-old Cox from limbo\nlast summer after he was cut by the Bears, said of the fines, ``I'm\nnot in a position to agree or disagree.'' But he also said that the\nhit against McNair ``could have been interpreted in a couple of\nways.''\n\n   Cox, a former Pro Bowler who was out of shape when Parcells\ncalled on him, quickly become a major figure on defense for a team\nhurt by injuries to its linebackers. He is now the starting\nweakside linebacker, having sent last year's top draft pick, James\nFarrior, to the sideline.\n","Headline":"\nCOX, FINED, ACCUSES NFL OF RACISM \n","Text":["\n   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bryan Cox, believed to be the most heavily\nfined player in pro football history, has been on his best behavior\nsince joining the New York Jets in August and, as a result, had\nbeen enjoying a fine-free season.\n","\n   But the National Football League fined Cox $10,000 Wednesday for\nunnecessary roughness during the Jets' victory last Sunday in\nNashville, and afterward he lashed out, accusing the league of\nracism.\n","\n   Cox, who is black, used the words ``tokens'' and ``house\nNegroes'' in discussing two black NFL officials _ Gene Washington,\nthe director of football operations, who handed down the fine, and\nHarold Henderson, the labor relations director.\n","\n   ``With this league being over 70 percent black, and within the\nleague office all the black people that are in any position of\nauthority are always pitted against the players in the league,''\nCox said. ``I feel like that's unfortunate, and I don't like\nthat.''\n","\n   Cox, a linebacker, was not penalized for either of the plays for\nwhich he was fined Wednesday.
