Most of the 169 pages, which\ninclude forewords, are straightforward narratives of ascents. But\namong them is an emotional account of one trip when his partner\ndidn't come back; a skiing partner died of a heart attack during a\nsnowstorm.\n\n   It's really too bad Clyde, described as a ``vanishing\nVictorian,'' didn't write more about himself and his adventures,\nand not merely climbing tales. Not only was he a world-class\nclimber, he plucked injured, lost, stranded and _ too often _ dead\nclimbers and skiers from various locales during winters. He had a\nnose for finding wrecked planes, as well.\n\n   Clyde initially turned to climbing after his wife died four\nyears into their marriage and spent much of the rest of his life in\nthe mountains. One foreword notes that he was principal of a high\nschool in Independence until he was fired for shooting warning\nshots at youthful pranksters.\n\n   This candid look at Sierra hiking should be engaging for the\ncasual reader, and Clyde's accounts of early ascents might be\nespecially fascinating to hard-core mountain climbers.
