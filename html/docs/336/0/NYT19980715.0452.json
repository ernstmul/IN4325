Each of the waters has strong populations\nof wild brown, rainbow and brook trout, and bi-weekly plants of\ncatchable trout are made by the Department of Fish and Game to\nensure the fishery remains healthy.\n\n   However, if you come to the Eastern Sierra for solace and a\npristine mountain experience, that isn't what you'll likely find at\nthese intensely popular roadside jumping-off spots.\n\n   The good news is that solitude is just a short walk away, at\nFantail Lake _ a backcountry brook-trout nirvana that is accessible\nto anyone willing to carry their gear on their backs for 1{ miles.\n\n   Retired Department of Fish and Game biologist Phil Pister used\nto say that the limit on brook trout at Fantail Lake and the\nsurrounding area should be ``all you could carry'' because of their\npropensity to overpopulation in these high-elevation lakes.\n\n   At his prodding, under a special bonus limit, 10 brook trout\nmeasuring less than eight inches could be kept in addition to the\nregular five-fish limit. That means anglers can keep 15 brookies\nper day, and 15 would just about make a decent meal for a hungry\nfisherman who's made the walk into the Mine Creek drainage that is\nhome to Fantail Lake.\n\n   (As of March 1, the size maximum was raised to 10 inches; the\nbrook trout special bonus limit applies to the entire Sierra\nFishing District.)\n\n   The trailhead to Mine Creek, the former mining site of\nBennettville and Fantail Lake, is found at Tioga Junction\nCampground off Highway 120, about three miles north of Tioga Pass\nand the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park.\n\n   Officials in Lee Vining note that Highway 120 and the trail to\nFantail Lake are free of snow but that the lake is ``about 97{\npercent iced over.'' But things change quickly in the Sierra\nNevada, and it could break open anytime.\n\n   Five minutes up the trail to Bennettville, visitors will be in\nquiet forest and away from the bustle of the roads and campground.\nOnce the restored site of Bennettville at about the\nthree-quarter-mile mark, it's just a short way to Mine Creek and\nthe first in a string of small lakes in this small, understated\nvalley. The trail follows the creek and the shorelines of each\nlake. A few hikers might be spotted on weekends. But if you fish on\na weekday, you are likely to have the whole area to yourself.\n\n   Shell Lake is the first in the series, and there is some deeper\nwater along the southwest shoreline. Most of the lake is shallow\nand the brook trout cruise these shallows feeding on just about\nanything that falls in the water. A small ant pattern fished on fly\ntackle or on spinning tackle behind a bobber will catch dozens and\ndozens of the small, colorful fish. A tiny spinner, like a Panther\nMartin or Roostertail, is also very effective.\n\n   At 9,842 feet, Shell Lake is typical of most high elevation\nSierra waters. It is packed with very small brookies. Because the\ngrowing season is short and trout have few natural predators, the\nbrookies have a tendency to overpopulate the lake and rarely get\nmore than six inches long. They do provide great action on light\ntackle, and Shell is just the first of three waters in Mine Creek\nvalley.\n\n   The next lake up the trail is unnamed and about a third the size\nof Shell. It, too, is packed with fish, but far fewer because it is\nmore shallow and might see a die-off over some winters.\n\n   But above the unnamed gem is a stretch of stream with big pools\npacked with trout. Try fishing your way up the valley and into the\noutlet of Fantail Lake, the biggest of the lakes in the vicinity.\nThis lake is just inside the Harvey Monroe Hall Research Natural\nArea in the extreme northern end of the Inyo National Forest.\n\n   Most of Fantail is shallow and fish are spread throughout the\nlake _ most abundantly at the inlet and outlet and along the deeper\nwater on the south shoreline.\n\n   From Fantail, Mine Creek heads west up a steep slope to Mine\nCreek headwaters in Spuller Lake. You can fish all the way up to\nSpuller or hike over the saddle due north of Fantail and hike down\nthe ridge dividing the Mine Creek and Lee Vining Creek drainages,\nand then fish Lee Vining Creek back to where you parked. That whole\nloop measures just more than three miles round-trip. The hike up to\nSpuller adds nearly two miles to the hike.\n\n   Standing on the upper end of Fantail Lake and looking to the\nsoutheast, one can see the Dana Plateau and 13,053-foot Mount Dana.\n\n   From this vantage point, you will find it difficult to believe\nthere are strings of cars bustling up and down a road just a couple\nof miles away and crowds of fishermen struggling to catch a few\ntrout on roadside lakes.
