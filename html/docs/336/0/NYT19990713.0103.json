LAKSHMANAN  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   SHANGHAI _ China's richest and most Westernized city is\nconfronting an unpleasant underside of being a modern,\nconsumer-oriented metropolis: garbage. Tons of it.\n\n   Once a thrifty populace, Chinese consumers are now buying more\nproducts wrapped in elaborate packaging and throwing them away\nsooner. Cities such as Shanghai are spending money and energy to\nmove and treat ever greater amounts of trash, and losing precious\nland to dumps and landfills.\n\n   Sun Mingyang, 70, a farmer from Anhui province, is one of\nthousands who have migrated to Shanghai to make a living collecting\ngarbage. Ten hours a day, he drags a rickshaw behind him and loads\nit with waste cardboard, which he exchanges for cash at one of\nhundreds of primitive downtown recycling lots, a vast expanse of\nglass heaps, bottlecaps, plastic piles, and paper mountains that\nhas become a virtual city unto itself.\n\n   ``This cardboard is useless now, but we can produce new things\nwith it, like your notebook,'' Sun said. He makes the equivalent of\n$2.50 a day, four times his earnings as a farmer. He also\nrecognizes the social import of his arduous work. ``We create a lot\nmore waste than before. . . . What I do is good. I clean the\nplace.''\n\n   This commercial capital of more than 13 million people produces\n26.4 million pounds of waste daily, and it is piling up faster than\nthe city's garbagemen can collect it. Two pounds of garbage per\nperson per day is low by Western standards _ the average American\ncreates 4.4 pounds a day.\n\n   But that is changing. The vast majority of Chinese have incomes\nfar below those of consumers in developed nations, but China is\nprojected to have the world's largest economy by 2020. The\nresulting waste problem will have implications for air, land, and\nwater quality, and for energy use and the economy.\n\n   Per capita garbage production is rising 10 percent a year in a\nnation with nearly five times the population of the United States,\nmaking the environmental problems accompanying China's breakneck\neconomic growth a threat to the global, as well as local,\nenvironment.\n\n   Shanghai doesn't want its trash to become a cause celebre like\nNew York's notorious ``garbage barge,'' which in 1987 was turned\naway from five states and three countries. Shanghai already has\n2,000 trash heaps; nationwide, dumps cover 193 square miles.\n\n   But Chinese cities are running out of places to dump their\ntrash. Some have turned to incineration, but burning is\ncontroversial because it releases toxic gases.\n\n   So Shanghai, which prides itself on being China's trendsetter,\nis trying to promote recycling. Next month, officials say they will\nlaunch a program in one of the city's 15 districts to test the\npublic's willingness to separate garbage _ and the government's\nability to process it.\n\n   Both Beijing and Shanghai have tried pilot programs before,\nwithout success. Collectors stored the trash and then eventually\njust re-mixed the items that residents had separated because the\ngovernment had nowhere to recycle them.\n\n   ``When a country is first developing, people say, `We want\nmoney; we don't care about quality of life,' '' said Feng Suwei,\ndirector of Shanghai's Environmental Sanitation Administrative\nBureau. The city, he said, is in the second stage of development,\nwhen a government with rising revenues can start to think about\nminimizing the environmental impact of growth.\n\n   But ``to protect the environment is a very high investment. Not\nevery city can afford it. . . . China is developing later, so we\nare doing this later.''\n\n   In fact, China began recycling in the 1950s, but not in the way\nwe think of it today. Living standards were low, and reusing every\nshred of almost everything was a state-sponsored ``mass activity''\nand an economic necessity.\n\n   Some old-fashioned, direct-use recycling still takes place. Like\nhundreds of other pig farmers, Sheng Jingrong, 34, bicycles three\nhours each way into the city to dig in restaurant trash bins for\ndiscarded food for his 80 pigs.\n\n   Shanghai once had 500 state-run recycling stations where people\nsold everything from chicken feathers and hair to scrap metal and\nold books. In the past two decades of a more market-driven economy,\nall but 50 of those operations went out of business because they\nwere unprofitable.\n\n   Small-time entrepreneurs have filled the void, buying and\nselling scrap at a small profit to factories in neighboring Jiangsu\nand Zhejiang provinces to make new bottles and cans.\n\n   Huang Weiguo, 31, runs a plastics recycling lot piled high with\nbottles separated into piles of red, yellow, blue, and orange. He\npays collectors 12 cents for every 2.2 pounds of plastic they bring\nin, and he resells it to factories for a penny profit per pound. He\nclears $185 a month, 2 1/2 times his pension as a laid-off state\nfactory worker.\n\n   Sanitation officials say it's great to combine reemployment with\nrecycling, and they don't mind collectors making money off\nShanghai's garbage. But Feng complains that many factories in\nZhejiang and Jiangsu that use Shanghai's recycled trash are\npolluting the air and water. ``We don't like the idea that\nShanghai's garbage is producing more environmental problems in\nother places,'' he said.\n\n   Feng says Shanghai could recycle its waste cleanly and\nefficiently, and turn waste treatment into ``the main industry of\nShanghai in the 21st century.''\n\n   In the upcoming pilot project, the city will ask residents to\nseparate trash into toxic, wet, and dry piles. Feng estimates 28\npercent can be reused, but that it will take at least five years to\nget the whole city to comply.\n\n   Song Qinghua, of the environmenal advocacy group Global Village\nof Beijing, says that's a good idea, but says China needs stronger\nregulations to deter pollution and enforce recycling. She says that\nthe government should create a market for recycled goods by, for\nexample, requiring that state-owned enterprises buy at least half\ntheir paper from recycling mills.\n\n   Last year, when her group tried to print a report on recycled\npaper, it couldn't find a single factory making the stuff.\n\n   Part of the problem is that unlike those in Western countries\ncity governments here get no tax revenue or federal funds to\nfinance garbage collection.\n\n   Feng says Shanghai is considering a waste tax on manufacturers,\nsimilar to ones in developed countries, to fund environmental\nefforts. The city also will push for national legislation to\nenforce recycling.\n\n   ``If this is going to work,'' he said, ``we need the support of\nbusiness, nongovernmental organizations, citizens, every sector of\nsociety.''\n","Headline":"\nCHINA GARBAGE PROBLEM MOUNTING \n","Text":["\n   SHANGHAI _ China's richest and most Westernized city is\nconfronting an unpleasant underside of being a modern,\nconsumer-oriented metropolis: garbage.
