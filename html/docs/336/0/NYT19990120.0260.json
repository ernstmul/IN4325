Times News Service   \n\n   For Meriwether Lewis, the moment of truth between human and bear\noccurred on June 14, 1805, one day after he had discovered the\nGreat Falls of the Missouri. (Lewis and Clark's bear lore, along\nwith their other exploits, can be followed on line at\nwww.lewis-clark.org.)\n\n   ``Having entirely forgotten to reload my rifle,'' Lewis wrote in\nhis diary, ``a large white, or rather brown bear, had perceived and\ncrept on me within 20 steps before I discovered him.'' Lewis tried\nto walk slowly toward a tree 300 yards distant. ``I had no sooner\nturned myself about but he pitched at me, open mouthed and full\nspeed. I ran about 80 yards and found he gained on me fast. I then\nran into the water.'' The grizzly bear abruptly turned away.\n\n   ``The cause of his alarm still remains with me mysterious and\nunaccountable,'' Lewis wrote, and many have echoed his words since\nthen.\n\n   Today, the grizzlies of the Great Plains, so plentiful in Lewis\nand Clark's diaries, have been wiped out or driven into the\nmountains, but environmentalists, students, hikers and anyone who\nwants to feel a sense of deep respect can go bear trekking on the\nWeb.\n\n   The Bear Den (www.nature-net.com/bears) is a home page for all\nthings ursine, including pandas, which have traditionally been\nlumped with the raccoon family but are actually closer relatives of\nthe bears, according to recent DNA evidence.\n\n   The Bear Den is run by Don Middleton, a school psychologist in\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba, which is near a big black bear\npopulation in Riding Mountain National Park.\n\n   Middleton's site has descriptions of the eight bear species,\nincluding the sloth bear of Asia, sun bear, spectacled bear and\ngiant panda, all of them rare; Asiatic black bear, and the more\nfamiliar brown, black and polar bears. It also has reviews of bear\nbooks, videos, CD-ROMs and gear.\n\n   Various links explore such controversial questions as the\nusefulness of bear bells (are they a warning device or just noise\npollution) and pepper spray (you don't want to get close enough to\nfind out).\n\n   ``Media, including the recent movie `The Edge,' usually portray\nbears in unrealistic and anthropomorphic ways,'' Middleton wrote by\ne-mail. ``I hope that people extensively studying my site will see\nbears for what they are _ majestic pinnacle predators who should be\nleft alone for the most part, only studied from a distance and also\nharbingers or sentinels of the sustainability of our last remaining\nwilderness areas.''\n\n   The Bear Den also pays homage to the need to talk about one's\nbear feelings. A sample from the Quotes About Bears page comes from\nJohn Muir, the pioneer: ``Bears are not companions of men, but\nchildren of God, and His charity is broad enough for both.''\nAnother is from John Murray: ``Those who have packed far up into\ngrizzly country know that the presence of even one grizzly on the\nland elevates the mountains, deepens the canyons, chills the winds,\nbrightens the stars, darkens the forest and quickens the pulse of\nall who enter it. They know that when a bear dies, something sacred\nin every living thing interconnected with that realm ... also\ndies.''\n\n   That verges on religion, but something meaningful often does\nhappen in bear encounters. John W. Uhler has put together a Bear\nStory site on the Total Yellowstone Page\n(www.Yellowstone-Natl-Park.Com/bearstor.htm), a selection of\nup-close-and-personal accounts.\n\n   James Musgrove's recently updated site on the American grizzly\nbear (home.att.net/jrmusgrove/index.htm), provides a look at\ncurrent legal disputes and government action regarding the often\nlopsided battle between friends of the bears and the logging,\nmining and ranching interests.\n\n   A sad but important part of his reporting is a running death\ncount (23 grizzlies were killed in and around Glacier National Park\nin 1998).\n\n   Lloyd W. Hofmann, creator of a short guide called Bear Fact\n(www.planet.eon.net/homac/bear.html), wrote: ``I spend every second\nweekend in Jasper National Park mountain biking.
