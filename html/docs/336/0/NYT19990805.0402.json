Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charged\nThursday that a subsidiary of Bear Stearns Cos., Wall Street's\nsixth-largest brokerage firm, was a major force behind a fraud that\nled to millions of dollars in investor losses.\n\n   Bear Stearns settled the fraud charges with the commission and\nthe Manhattan district attorney without admitting or denying the\nallegations, and agreed to pay $38.5 million in fines and\nrestitution. The commission also brought securities fraud charges\nagainst Richard Harriton, the president of the subsidiary, who\nresigned and plans to fight the charges.\n\n   The settlement ends a three-year investigation into Bear\nStearns' role handling securities trades for A.R. Baron, a small\nNew York brokerage firm that collapsed in 1996 and caused $75\nmillion in investor losses.\n\n   By holding Bear Stearns accountable in the Baron case, the SEC\nmakes clear that any firm, legal, accounting or financial, that\nhelps another commit a fraud must take responsibility.\n\n   In its settlement, the commission described a pattern of\nmisconduct that is surprising for a firm of Bear Stearns' stature.\nThe SEC said that Bear Stearns took extraordinary steps to keep\nA.R. Baron, an obviously troubled firm, in business. It knew that\nBaron completed numerous trades that were unauthorized, yet the\nlarger firm took money from accounts to pay for the unauthorized\ntrades and refused to return the funds to the customers even after\nBaron admitted as much.\n\n   Although the $38.5 million that Bear has agreed to pay is\nimmaterial to the wealthy firm, the settlement will damage its\nreputation among clients, creditors and competitors. Of that\namount, $5 million is a fine paid to the SEC, the sixth-largest\nfine ever levied against a brokerage firm.\n\n   Throughout the investigation, Bear Stearns maintained that it\ndid nothing wrong. Bear Stearns said Thursday that the fraud\ncharges were merely technical in nature.\n\n   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, disagreed.\n``Bear Stearns Securities Corp. is charged with causing a massive\nfraud, a fraud that cost investors millions,'' Walker said. ``There\nis nothing new in the proposition that those participating in a\nfraud should be held accountable for it.''\n\n   The settlement is by no means the end of the investigations into\nBear Stearns' activities as the Wall Street leader in clearing, the\nbusiness of processing securities trades for other smaller firms\nand providing them with capital to operate. Federal prosecutors in\nBrooklyn and Manhattan continue to examine Bear Stearns' clearing\nrelationships with two other small brokerage firms charged with\nbilking investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent\nyears.\n\n   At a press conference in lower Manhattan Thursday, Robert\nMorgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said that his criminal\ninvestigation into Harriton's conduct also remains active. In a\nstatement, Harriton's lawyer called the SEC civil complaint\nbaseless and said that his client would fight the charges.\n\n   James Cayne, the chief executive officer of Bear Stearns who has\nvigorously defended Harriton throughout the investigation, said:\n``We are disappointed that Dick is leaving, but we understand that\nhis considerations as an individual are different than ours as a\ncorporation. We respect his decision.'' Asked if Bear Stearns is\npaying Harriton's legal bills, a firm spokeswoman declined to\ncomment.\n\n   The details laid out in the SEC's 23-page cease and desist order\nbelie past claims by Bear Stearns' management that its powerful\nclearing subsidiary had only a passive role, if any at all, in the\nBaron fraud.\n\n   Earlier this year, the commission began imposing new rules for\nclearing firms that require them to notify regulators of customer\ncomplaints, rules intended to prevent such transgressions in the\nfuture. Historically, clearing firms have argued that they simply\nprocess trades and are therefore not responsible for policing\npractices at the smaller brokerage firms they count as customers.\nThose days are over. ``This case establishes that clearing firms\ncannot simply turn a blind eye to fraud,'' Morgenthau said.\n\n   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns did that and more. Although\nBear Stearns was aware of excessive unauthorized trading in Baron\naccounts, Walker said the firm helped keep A.R. Baron in business,\nallowing it to defraud customers.\n\n   The violations upon which the SEC order are based took place\nfrom September 1995 through July 1996. The SEC alleges that many of\nBear Stearns' violations came as Harriton tried to protect the\ncompany from large losses as a result of its clearing relationship\nwith the financially troubled A.R. Baron.\n\n   It took only two months of transactions with A.R. Baron for Bear\nStearns employees to see signs of fraud in Baron's practices.\nAlmost immediately, Bear Stearns began taking steps to insulate\nitself from the smaller firm's fraudulent activities. On Sept. 22,\nHarriton required that all Baron's trades in customer accounts be\nfaxed to Bear Stearns; only those trades that the firm determined\nwould not increase its credit exposure to Baron were allowed. This\nmeant that many trades ordered by Baron's customers were not\ncompleted.\n\n   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns not only disregarded the\ninstructions of Baron's customers, but repeatedly charged those\ncustomers with trades that it knew were unauthorized. In one case,\ninvolving a Baron customer Diaward Steel Works Ltd., Bear Stearns\ntook it upon itself to sell $1 million of the customers' securities\nto cover trades that the clearing firm knew to be unauthorized and\nthat Diaward refused to pay for.\n\n   nn\n\n   According to the SEC, Bear Stearns also refused to return\nsecurities and funds that it had taken to pay for unauthorized\ntrades to their rightful owners, even though Baron had told Bear\nStearns the trades were unauthorized. Bear Stearns also repeatedly\nasked for credit extensions to cover Baron's unauthorized trades\nand helped Baron to operate even when the firm's capital fell below\nthe amount required by regulators for it to be able to continue\nconducting business.\n\n   In addition, Harriton encouraged employees to discard documents\nrelating to A.R. Baron's operations, a violation of securities laws\nthat require firms to maintain such records.\n\n   When HMA Investments Inc., a Baron customer, complained to Bear\nStearns about unauthorized trades in its account and provided Bear\nStearns with a letter from two Baron brokers admitting the trades\nwere unauthorized, Harriton refused to reverse the transactions. He\nalso froze accounts HMA held at another brokerage firm whose trades\nBear Stearns cleared. In January 1996, Harriton directed Bear\nStearns to liquidate HMA's accounts at the other brokerage firm and\ncredited Baron with the payment.\n\n   Fiduciary Management Services Ltd., a private company based in\nthe Bahamas, lost $890,000 in the A.R. Baron fraud. Ian Barry, the\nfirm's investment manager, was vigilant about notifying Bear\nStearns when unauthorized trades showed up in its account. But Bear\nStearns simply referred him back to A.R. Baron.\n\n   Barry initially felt confident that the problems would be\naddressed. He said: ``I had a definite comfort level knowing Bear\nStearns was there. I feel I acted in accordance with the\nrequirements and I was let down.'' Fiduciary took its case to Lewis\nLowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer who was one of the first\nto recognize that clearing firms were not completely insulated from\nliability stemming from the behavior of their clearing firm\ncustomers. When told of the settlement, Barry said: ``We hope that\nthis will finally bring our recovery efforts to a satisfactory\nconclusion. We always felt that Bear Stearns bore certain\nresponsibilities in this matter.''\n\n   In its charges against Harriton, the SEC alleges that Harriton\nhad a deal with Andrew Bressman, chairman of A.R. Baron, to profit\npersonally from initial public offerings underwritten by the firm.\nOnly the fact that Baron failed before the stock offering could be\ncompleted prevented Harriton from making good on this arrangement,\nwhich would have been outright securities fraud.\n\n   William McLucas, partner at Wilmer Cutler & Pickering in\nWashington and a former director of enforcement at the SEC when the\ncase began, called the Bear Stearns settlement a warning flag to\nothers. ``It says to a clearing firm you cannot ignore clear and\nunequivocal evidence of violations of the law and abuse of\ncustomers by the introducing firm, and if you do, you do so at your\nperil.''\n\n   In settling with the SEC, Bear Stearns agreed to cease and\ndesist from committing or causing any such frauds in the future. It\nalso agreed to retain, within one month's time, an independent\nconsultant, to be appointed by the SEC, to conduct a review of the\nfirm's supervisory and compliance policies.\n\n   As part of the settlement announced Thursday, Bear Stearns\nagreed to pay $1 million to the state of New York, $1 million to\nthe City of New York and $1.5 million to the district attorney's\noffice to cover the costs of the investigation.\n\n   That Bear Stearns was a direct cause of a significant securities\nfraud is a black mark on the record of its chairman, Alan\nGreenberg, and president, James Cayne, upon whose watch these\ntransgressions took place. The board of directors could be\nvulnerable to charges that it was not attending to details as well.\n\n   A clue to how a firm as big and well-known as Bear Stearns could\nhave been an integral part of such a fraud may lie in a promotional\npiece Bear Stearns published celebrating its scrappy corporate\nculture.
