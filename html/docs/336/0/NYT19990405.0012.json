Absolutely rocked.\nUNH won the games, 6-1 and 4-1, and won the Hockey East\nregular-season championship.\n\n   And Maine coach Shawn Walsh was calm as could be afterward. Said\nhe loved the atmosphere. Couldn't wait for the playoffs to begin.\nLoved the way his team played.\n\n   But 10-2 in two games, coach?\n\n   Not a problem. There were bigger _ much bigger _ to come.\n\n   Losing a couple of games in March sure beats losing a game in\nApril, he said.\n\n   Then the Black Bears, who didn't exactly roar into the playoffs,\nroared through them and were April perfect. Two wins, no losses. An\nNCAA championship.\n\n   Saturday night they outlasted UNH, 3-2, in overtime at Arrowhead\nPond to finish off their second title of the decade. This team, led\nby captain Steve Kariya, matched the 1993 title of the team led by\nhis older brother, Paul, then a freshman at Maine and now a\nsuperstar for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.\n\n   ``Paul said to me all year long just to go out and relax and\nhave fun,'' Steve said. ``To enjoy the moment. I can't say enough\nabout my four years here. It's gratifying for me and the fellow\nseniors. We knew we'd be a winning team. And there's no better\nfeeling than this.''\n\n   The game and the season _ and the last four years, for that\nmatter _ were a credit to perseverance.\n\n   Maine players stuck with the program through the NCAA penalties\nfor rules violations that kept the school ineligible for the NCAA\ntournament in 1996 and 1997.\n\n   Saturday night, Maine led, 2-0, on goals by Ben Guite in the\nfirst period and Niko Dimitrakos early in the second.\n\n   Less than three minutes after Dimitrakos made it 2-0, it was\nnearly 3-0. Dan Kerluke put the puck in the net, but the goal was\ndisallowed after video review because a player's skate was in the\ncrease.\n\n   Still, UNH, getting tons of chances but being denied by an\noutstanding effort by Maine goalie Alfie Michaud, was in trouble.\n\n   Credit the Wildcats. They hung in and killed off a minute and 23\nseconds of a five-on-three Maine power play. They got a shorthanded\ngoal from Darren Haydar, breaking out of the penalty box, and it\nwas 2-1.\n\n   In the third period, junior Mike Souza tied it, finishing a\nHaydar-Krog-Souza relay.\n\n   Remember last year's championship game at the FleetCenter when\nBoston College lost to Michigan, 3-2, in overtime? This was that\nall over again.\n\n   ``Last year's BC-Michigan game was a great game, and this game\nwas right there with it,'' said Maine coach Shawn Walsh.\n\n   Spectacular saves from both goalies. Great defensive plays to\nbreak up great scoring chances. Help from the posts. Good bounces.\nBad bounces.\n\n   Michaud, who had 46 saves when it was all over, got Maine to\novertime.\n\n   UNH sophomore Ty Conklin, who had 36, did his share, too.\nConklin, on the ice, held off a couple of Maine chances 6:47 into\novertime.\n\n   Michaud stopped a Krog tip-in try at 8:53 and then barely got\nhis stick on an in-close shot by John Sadowski.\n\n   Moments later, Maine senior forward Marcus Gustafsson took a\npass from Cory Larose. He shot and then followed his rebound and\npopped it over Conklin.\n\n   It was over. At 10:50 of overtime, Maine, which lost in the 1995\ntitle game to Boston University, clinched another title.\n\n   And how about Gustafsson for perseverance? He was on the roster\nbut dressed for only one game in the 1995 season. He went home to\nSweden to fulfill a military obligation. He believed he had\nsomething to prove as a player, and came back to Maine.\n\n   ``I believe in myself and I wanted to come back and show\neveryone I was a better player than I was in my freshman year,'' he\nsaid.\n\n   He did that. He finished his career on the Black Bears' top line\nwith Larose and Kariya, and scored a huge goal.\n\n   In the end, Maine had one power-play goal _ Guite's _ in seven\ntries. New Hampshire was 0 for 7 on the power play.\n\n   In Durham last month, Maine was 0 for 12 over the two nights.\nNew Hampshire was 5 for 9.\n\n   The teams split their first four games, and at the end it should\nhave come as no surprise to anyone that the rubber match went to\novertime.\n\n   Maine finished 31-6-4, New Hampshire 31-7-3.\n\n   UNH took a couple of major steps this season. First outright\nHockey East championship. First NCAA championship game appearance.\nMost wins. First Hobey Baker Award winner in Krog.\n\n   And the Wildcats came up just short of a national championship.\n\n   ``The puck bounced for Maine and they made a great play to end\nthe game,'' said UNH coach Dick Umile, who will try to take his\nWildcats one win further next year.\n\n   Maine beat league rivals Boston College and then UNH, both in\novertime, to win its title.\n\n   ``Obviously, either of these games could have gone the other\nway,'' Walsh said. ``Hey, you get lucky. They didn't score on one\nand we scored on one. That's what happened.''\n\n   And what happened was a national championship. No team has won\nback-to-back titles since BU in 1971 and 1972. There have been\nrumblings that Walsh may move on, but with him or without him, that\nwill be a target.\n\n   When it comes right down to it, one out of three ain't bad.\n\n   The Black Bears lost the series at New Hampshire and missed out\non the regular-season league title. They lost to BC, 3-2, in the\nHockey East semifinals, and thus missed out on the tournament\ntitle.\n\n   Then they bagged the big one.\n\n   They'll take that.\n","Headline":"\nPERSEVERANCE IS THE RULE FOR MAINE \n","Text":["\n   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It did not appear to be the ideal way to end\nthe regular season and pick up steam heading into playoffs.\n","\n   The University of Maine went to a rocking Whittemore Center at\nthe University of New Hampshire and got rocked.
