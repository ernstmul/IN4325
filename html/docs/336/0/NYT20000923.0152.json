But what is a natural process for\nbears amounted to an intrusion, as far as humans were concerned,\ninto the habitat in which homo sapiens is the top of the food\nchain.\n\n   When that happened, encounters between humans and bears vaulted\nup as quick as a cub climbing a spruce tree.\n\n   Bears invariably came out the losers in those encounters. They\nended up as road kill, they were blasted by landowners and wildlife\nofficers, they were shot with darts to tranquilize them and rushed\nin metal tubes to new territory.\n\n   Statewide, a record 132 bears have been killed by law\nenforcement and private citizens this year. That does not include\nbears shot by hunters.\n\n   The number and notoriety of human-bear encounters, however,\ntends to obscure the fact that the bears are involved in a natural\nprocess that poses little threat to the overall bear population,\nBeck said.\n\n   Bear distress is not unusual. In most years, eight out of 10, he\nsaid, bears somewhere in the state suffer to some degree. People\ntend to know nothing about that, though, because bears by nature\nare secretive and prefer to avoid people.\n\n   In 2000, bears ``happen to be having a bad year where a lot of\npeople can see them, so it's a lot more apparent.''\n\n   In fact, many bears will die this winter but that doesn't mean\nthat man should intrude deeply in the process, even though the\nharsh summer will strike most heavily on the young, Beck said.\n\n   Cubs born last January and this year's yearlings are the most\nvulnerable, he said, because they have been unable to put on enough\nfat for the winter, to say nothing of getting enough food for\nnormal skeletal and muscular development.\n\n   ``There will be a significant die-off in the den,'' he said.\n``They simply won't emerge from hibernation.''\n\n   Something else will happen to reduce the number of bears that\nemerge from hibernation next spring.\n\n   Fertilized embryos in pregnant sows won't implant in the uterus,\nso no cubs will be born to those bears, he said.\n\n   Moreover, many of the young females that might otherwise be\nexpected to breed this spring and give birth in 2001 will be\nreproductively stunted, delaying their estrous cycle by a year.\n\n   The result of those factors could play out in the breeding\nseason of 2001, producing ``a big synchrony of cubs the next\nyear,'' he said.\n\n   Another factor contributing to the likely health of the overall\nbear population is that all bears haven't suffered equally in the\ndrought.\n\n   Wildlife officers have found bears with as little as a half-inch\nof fat this year, putting them at a severe disadvantage against the\nwinter chill, said Steve Yamashita, area wildlife manager in the\nGrand Junction office of the Colorado Division of Wildlife.\n\n   Still other bears have been found packing fat layers as thick as\ntwo inches, an ample store for the winter, Yamashita said.\n\n   The sight of thin bears seeking food is understandably\ndistressing, Beck said, but not necessarily a signal that the\nentire population is suffering.\n\n   Allowing for 1,000 square miles of bear habitat on the\nUncompahgre Plateau and figuring one square mile per bear, ``You\ncould have as many as 1,000 bears up there,'' he said.\n\n   ``If you have 20 or 30 or even 50 bears come down into town,\nthat still means you've got a lot of bears on the mountain.''\n\n   Beck said he discourages the idea of humans providing food in\nnatural bear habitat for a couple of reasons.\n\n   For one thing, if people mean to give food to starving bears,\nputting fruit and other feed on the mountain won't help the bruins\nthat already are roaming elsewhere for food. It could, however,\ncause conflicts among the well-fed bears that discover the food, he\nsaid.\n\n   In any case, older bears with established territories aren't\nnecessarily in danger during a lean year such as this, he said,\nbecause their fat stores carry over from year to year.\n\n   Knowing that you can assign a bear about one square mile of\nhabitat isn't the same as knowing how many bears there are in a\ngiven region, Beck said.\n\n   Big boars, he said, can range across some 250 miles and share\nterritory with many bears. They tend not to gather in herds, but\nthey also aren't necessarily hostile to their own kind.\n\n   Bears, Beck said, ``are solitary but social animals.''\n\n   Bears will share food sources, such as berry patches and\nacorn-laden oak brush, but they won't feed in the same places at\nthe same time as other bears, he said.\n\n   They share food sources ``by time,'' he said.\n\n   While humans finding a food source might hoard it, bears will\neat their fill, leaving plenty for others, and move on, he said.\n\n   After all, ``The best time to go exploring is on a full belly,''\nhe said.\n\n   Well-traveled bears, though, are hard-to-count bears.\n\n   Add to that the fact that the black bears that populate Colorado\nchange color as the summer passes.\n\n   The dark-colored bear he spots one day might be the blonde bruin\nhe sees a month or so later, Beck said. Their fur tends to lighten\nas the summer goes along, almost as though they were getting their\nhair bleached. New fur on bears tends to come in dark, lending some\na mottled appearance.\n\n   The bears that have visited the Grand Valley have no intention\nof remaining through the winter among human populations, Yamashita\nsaid. They've already selected dens for their winter hibernation\nand are on the move solely in a search for food.\n\n   That search, though, has had dire consequences for several bears\nand saddened wildlife officers used to dealing with bears and the\nhard rules of nature.\n\n   Lyle Sidener, district wildlife manager in the Division of\nWildlife, wrote in a report on a June incident where a landowner\nhad shot a bear.\n\n   State law allows landowners to kill depredating bears and a bear\nin a chicken coop certainly qualified.
