Bald and golden eagles perch along the highway, and\nmoose fight off the summer heat by soaking in kiddie wading pools.\n\n   And yet, the 240-mile drive up Alaska Highway 1, from Anchorage\nto Denali National Park, is one long, stomach-churning adventure in\nsearch of the signature Alaskan wildlife: the grizzly bear.\n\n   The grizzlies of Denali are not the monstrous brown bears of\ncoastal Alaska or the1,000-pound heart-stoppers of Kodiak Island,\nthough they are plenty big.\n\n   Denali bears _ the main reason we made the long drive and got up\nat four in the morning to claim our seat on the bus _ are of the\nfamed blond variety, the Toklat grizzly of early Alaskan history\nfame, that live and thrive in this virtually untouched wilderness.\n\n   From the moment our driver and guide, Frank, pulled away from\nthe visitors center, to the time two hours into the trip that we\nsaw our first grizzly, 50 sets of eyes were glued to the slopes and\ncanyons of the park's back country.\n\n   Park administrators do a remarkable job of handling the massive\nnumbers of international tourists who travel to Alaska and then to\nthe park. Personal vehicle traffic is limited, but buses run often\nenough and far enough to allow everyone a chance to see a part of\nAmerica that can't be found anyplace else.\n\n   Somewhere past the Savage River parking area, past the lone\nArctic wolf, a couple of golden eagles and a few caribou, a large,\nextremely blond young male was spotted feeding on berries and sedge\nnear the bottom of a small hill.\n\n   Frank, who said he'd been driving the route for five years, had\ngiven us the requisite warning about talking too loud and treating\nthe animals as if they were living in a zoo. That didn't stop the\n''oohs and aahs'' or the comparisons with people or even the\noccasional ignorant outburst about how clumsy he looked.\n\n   I could have pointed out that the bear, if he wished, could have\ncovered the 100 yards from his feeding spot to the bus, UPHILL, in\nthree or four seconds. When he got there, he could have opened up\nthe vehicle like a sardine tin and fished out a tourist or two for\nbrunch. All without breaking a sweat.\n\n   But it was enough to know we'd seen the first grizzly of our\ntrip, the first that my wife had ever seen. The next would be even\nmore memorable, a sow and cub on a feeding jaunt that brought them\nto within 25 yards of the astounded crew on the shuttle bus.\n\n   I've been close to bears on rivers as they fished for salmon and\ninland as they laid claim to a moose I'd just killed. But this big\nfemale and her youngster were special. The bond that keeps a young\ngrizzly alive his first few years was apparent.\n\n   Baby bears face lots of obstacles to adulthood, the most\ndangerous one being other bears. At the very top of the food chain,\nbears fear little else in the wild. Males often kill young bears\nand even other adults. While we were in Alaska, one male known as\nBB killed a bear cub in full view of the stunned human visitors to\nsalmon fishing grounds on the Brooks River.\n\n   But this female kept a close watch on her young one, even while\nallowing him to roam and play while she dug for ground squirrels\nnext to the road. The smaller bear eventually lay down and went to\nsleep while she dug.\n\n   After his mother gave up and began to wander off, the cub\nclimbed over into the 3-foot deep hole for a quick lesson in\ndigging before loping off to join her.\n\n   Those sightings alone would have been enough to make our trip to\nDenali, but we saw another eight or nine bears on the way in and\nout to Eielson Visitor Center, 67 miles into the sprawling park.
