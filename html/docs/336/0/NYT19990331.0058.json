Can you tell me anything about a warning system called Pave\nPaws, built in the 1970s to detect ICBMs from the U.S.S.R.?\n\n   A: We're happy to, but it appears not to involve detection of\nintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), according to the\nDictionary of the Modern United States Military. Pave Paws _ whose\nformal name is the Precision Acquisition of Vehicle Entry,\nPhased-Array Warning System _ is an early-warning radar system\ndesigned to detect sea-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The\nmilitary dictionary says its radars have a range of 3,450 miles and\nare capable of counting re-entry vehicles as well as predicting\nwhere they would impact.\n\n   Since it can take 10 minutes or less for a SLBM to hit the\nUnited States, depending on the point of launch, Pave Paws radars\nare tied in to NORAD (North American Air Defense Command), the U.S.\nStrategic Command and the National Military Command Center to\nenable a quick military response if needed. The dictionary lists\nthese locations for Pave Paws radars: Robins Air Force Base in\nGeorgia (since installation, it has been mothballed); Otis Air\nNational Guard Base in Massachusetts; Goodfellow Air Force Base in\nTexas; and Beale Air Force Base in California.\n\n   Q: Who was the lone member of Congress who did not vote to\nsupport the U.S. effort in Yugoslavia?\n\n   A: Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the only dissenter on the\nresolution to to express House support for U.S. troops engaged in\nmilitary operations against Yugoslavia. Her office explained that\nthe freshman congresswoman is ``deeply concerned about the safety\nof our troops,'' but her vote was in objection to the language in\nHouse Resolution 130.\n\n   ``Because of its wording, today's resolution extended far beyond\nexpressing support for our troops,'' Lee said in her statement,\ndated March 24. ``The first clause of today's resolution asks the\nCongress to abdicate its responsibility for declarations of war\nand, instead, embrace the notion that the president can authorize\nthe commitment of U.S. troops to war without congressional\napproval. This is a notion which the Congress must reject for\nconstitutional reasons: It is completely impermissible for the\npresident to commit troops to war, a right given only to the\nCongress by the Constitution.''\n\n   In a separate action a day before the start of hostilities, 41\nsenators voted against a resolution supporting NATO air strikes\nagainst Yugoslavia.\n\n   Q: On current episodes of ``This Old House,'' Norm Abram is\nwalking around with his right arm in a sling. What happened?\n\n   A: A publicist at WGBH-TV in Boston, the station that produces\nthe program, said Abram tore his rotator cuff in a water-skiing\naccident. No further details were provided.\n\n   Q: How are the 30 companies chosen that make up the Dow Jones\nindustrial average?\n\n   A: Dow Jones & Co. explains that the editors of The Wall Street\nJournal select the components. They take a broad view of what\nindustrial means, too: In essence, it's almost any company that\nisn't in the transportation business or isn't a utility, because\nthere also are Dow Jones averages for those kinds of stocks.\n\n   In choosing a new company for the DJIA, the editors are said to\nlook among substantial industrial companies with a history of\nsuccessful growth and wide interest among investors.\n\n   The components aren't changed often. It isn't a ``hot stock''\nindex, after all, and the newspaper's editors believe that\nstability of composition enhances the trust that many people have\nin the averages. The most frequent reasons for changing a stock are\nthat something is happening to one of the components, such as being\nacquired, or that another company may become more representative as\na market barometer, or that a different sector of the economy\nshould be represented. Whenever one stock is changed, the others\nare reviewed.\n\n   The last time the Dow Jones industrial average stocks were\nchanged was in March 1997, when Woolworth, Westinghouse Electric,\nTexaco and Bethlehem Steel were deleted, and Hewlett-Packard,\nJohnson & Johnson, Traveler's Group and Wal-Mart were added. The\nlast changes before that came in 1991.\n\n   If you have Internet access, check this site for information:\nwww.dowjones.com/\n\n   Q: A short item in the newspaper reported that Cesar Chavez was\ninducted into the U.S. Labor Department's Hall of Fame as its 22nd\nmember. Who are the others?\n\n   A: These are the Labor Hall of Fame honorees, in addition to\nChavez: Mary Anderson, Cyrus S. Ching, John R. Commons, Eugene\nDebs, David Dubinsky, Arthur Goldberg, Samuel Gompers, William\nGreen, Sidney Hillman, Mother Jones, Henry J. Kaiser, John L.\nLewis, George Meany, James P. Mitchell, David A. Morse, Philip\nMurray, Frances Perkins, A. Philip Randolph, Walter Reuther, George\nW. Taylor and Robert F. Wagner.\n\n   The Hall of Fame posthumously recognizes Americans deemed to\nhave improved quality of life for U.S. workers by pushing for wage\nincreases, safer working conditions and more job opportunities.\n\n   Q: I know Q&A has printed this information in the past, and I\nsaved it, but now I can't find it. How do I get a presidential\ngreeeting sent to my grandmother, who will be 80 soon? She's a big\nfan of President Clinton's.\n\n   A: We haven't printed it lately, so we're glad to oblige for you\nand many other readers who have asked us to repeat it. In addition\nto birthday greetings for Americans 80 or older, anniversary\ngreetings are sent to couples celebrating 50 or more years of\nmarriage.\n\n   Requests must be put in writing and sent by mail to White House,\nAttn: Greetings Office, Room 39, Washington, DC 20502; or faxed to\n202-395-1232.\n\n   You should request a card at least six weeks prior to the\noccasion. For recorded information, call 202-456-2724.\n\n   Q: How can I contact the national headquarters of the Republican\nParty in Washington? I want to express my support of the party's\nnew stance on the abortion issue.\n\n   A: Write: Republican National Committee, 310 First St. S.E.,\nWashington, DC 20003. Or send an e-mail communication to the RNC at\nthis address: info(at)rnc.org\n\n   Q: Can you discuss the meaning and origin of the business terms\nbull market, bear market and blue chip? I hear them often, but\nwithout any explanation.\n\n   A: ``Bull market'' refers to a prolonged rise in the prices of\nstocks, bonds or commodities. Bull markets usually last a few\nmonths and are characterized by high trading volume. Various\ntheories are advanced about how the expression started, but the\nMorris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the most likely\none is that ``bull'' refers to a bull's habit of tossing its head\nupward.\n\n   ``Bear market'' is a prolonged period of falling prices. A bear\nmarket in stocks usually is brought on by the anticipation of\ndeclining economic activity, and a bear market in bonds is caused\nby rising interest rates. The most plausible origin, according to\nthe Morris Dictionary, is that ``bear'' comes from the old axiom\nabout ``selling the skin before you've caught the bear.'' A trader\nwho operates in this fashion once was known in England as a\n``bearskin jobber.'' An alternate explanation involves an attacking\nbear's habit of thrusting its paws upward.\n\n   ``Blue chip'' refers to the common stock of a nationally known\ncompany that has a long record of profit growth and dividend\npayment and a reputation for quality management, products and\nservices. Think IBM, GE and Du Pont, for example. Blue chip stocks\ntypically are relatively high priced and low yielding. The\nexpression was borrowed from gambling: The most valuable counters\nin poker are the blue chips.\n\n   Q: Can you settle something about my favorite country singer,\nClint Black? A co-worker said he's from New Jersey, but I could\nswear he's a native Texan, like I am. Can you clarify?\n\n   A: Brace yourself. Black was born Feb. 4, 1962, in Long Branch,\nN.J., according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.\nBut he grew up in Houston, the youngest of four brothers. And it\nwas in Houston where he started playing the harmonica at 13, and\nshortly thereafter used songbooks to teach himself to play the\nguitar. You know the rest.\n\n   Q: Some time ago, there was a move to convert the United States\nto the metric system. Whatever became of that?\n\n   A: It went into hibernation _ encouraged, but not put on the\nfront burner, and never officially canceled, either. The federal\nMetric Conversion Act of the mid-1970s was supposed to make metric\nthe accepted system in the United States. Even well before that _\nthe Metric Act of 1866 _ the metric system was given the official\nOK by the federal government. But it has never caught on, even\nthough Americans deal with 2-liter Coca-Cola bottles and liter wine\nbottles.\n\n   Since the conversion to metric in this country was never\nmandated, and no deadline was set for voluntary compliance, most\npeople have stuck with the tried-and-true. It's confusing, that's\nfor sure. Consider a breakfast oatmeal container with this on its\nlabel: ``42 oz.; 2 lbs. 10 oz.; 1.19 kg.'' The cereal's nutritional\nvalues are calculated in grams, but cooking instructions use\nstandard American-style measure. Go figure.\n\n   (END TAKE 2 OF 2 FILES)\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   Q: Q&A recently reported on the Dew Line and North Warning\nSystem.
