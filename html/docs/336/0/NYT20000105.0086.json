The\nholidays are over. But, assuming you're not reading this amid the\npost-apocalyptic ruins of your living room, there is still time to\nshop. Blame the late package on all the people who bought their\nstuff from Web sites and clogged the system.\n\n   One Web site scours the Internet for places that sell odd and\ninteresting stuff and links you to them. The site, www\n\n   .giftcrap.com, even divides the gifts into categories, to make\nthe shopping easier.\n\n   For those with a glutton on their list, try forkchops, ``the\nSwiss army knife of flatware.'' The chops are available at\nwww.forkchops.com. The combination knife, fork and chopsticks sell\nfor $3.95 a pair.\n\n   Or you can offer one share of Ben & Jerry's stock, a chance to\nown a piece of the company that brings so much joy to so many.\nShares of that company and others are available at www\n\n   .oneshare.com.\n\n   But perhaps the ultimate gift for gluttons is the picture\ncookie.

In 1998, the plan was broadened to include any black\nstudent interested in pursuing a college education.\n\n   The scholarships are funded by fees generated by the sale of\nproducts and services provided by the group's marketing partners.\nFor example, fees from the Black Colleges Visa card are allocated\nto the scholarship fund. Similar programs include business credit\ncards, communications, Internet sales, travel, insurance and\nlong-distance telephone service.\n\n   The plan to is tap into some of the estimated $500 billion spent\neach year by black Americans.\n\n   MAKING PETAT HOME\n\n   Cats and dogs pretty much dominate whatever home they occupy.\nRugs are playing fields, televisions become grooming pedestals and\nfurniture becomes hairy.\n\n   So why not buy your pet its own furniture? One Web site, www\n\n   .beastlyfurnishings.com, offers a wide selection of furniture\nfor cats and dogs.\n\n   Dog couches, chaise lounges and daybeds don't come cheap.
