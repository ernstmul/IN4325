He\njumped in an elevator, getting off at the first floor where he was\nconfront by a retired APD officer now working at the public\nhospital.

At least one analyst\nbelieves turnout on Thursday will be low.\n\n   `One reason is that things are going well,\n\n   ` said M. Lee Smith, a Nashville political analyst. The crime\nrate has dropped in Nashville. School funding increased in\nBredesen's term. The Tennessee Titans begin their inaugural season\nin August in a new $290 million stadium downtown.

Ann Richards, the\nfirst Democrat to lose to him, says the best way to go after George\nW.

As Bush looks more and more like the inevitable\nGOP nominee, the Democrats are scrambling for the most effective\nway of running against him.
