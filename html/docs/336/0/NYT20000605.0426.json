Times News Service    \n\n   NEW YORK _ When Carmen Dell'Orefice was 15 and modeling to help\nher mother pay the rent on a Third Avenue walk-up, she made a visit\nto the 57th Street studio of Louise Dahl-Wolfe.

When Dell'Orefice answered that she wasn't\nwearing any, the photographer dragged her to a window and pinched\nher eyelashes for proof.

A companion book by Richardson, ``Louise\nDahl-Wolfe: A Retrospective,'' is due from Harry N. Abrams this\nsummer. Some of Dahl-Wolfe's black-and-white images are on view at\nthe Staley-Wise gallery.\n\n   During her time at Bazaar, a 22-year tenure that ended when she\nquit in 1958, after the magazine's editor, Carmel Snow, and the\nlegendary art director Alexey Brodovitch both resigned, Dahl-Wolfe\nchronicled the birth of a looser, less pinched spirit in American\nfashion. With Diana Vreeland as her fashion editor, Dahl-Wolfe\ntraveled around the world, shooting that new concept, sportswear,\nout of doors where it comfortably breathed. Before the triumvirate\nof Snow, Vreeland and Dahl-Wolfe, American style, as Richard Avedon\nhas put it, did not exist.\n\n   ``Louise has a pivotal role moving fashion photography out of\nformal studio work into a portrayal of the active, modern American\nwoman,'' Amy Rule, an archivist at the Center for Creative\nPhotography, said.\n\n   Other photographers, like Martin Munkacsi and Toni Frissell,\nwere already capturing the new mood, but Dahl-Wolfe distinguished\nherself with images that implied a languorous sexuality. She often\nphotographed models on the beach, in repose, their eyes closed or\naverted, their bodies positioned _ trapped _ rigidly in the frame.\nDahl-Wolfe seemed to realize that new sportswear by Claire\nMcCardell and Bonnie Cashin offered women the semblance of an\nunconstricted life, not the real freedom that only a challenge to\naccepted social arrangements could bring.\n\n   The daughter of a Norwegian marine engineer, Louise Dahl was\nborn in San Francisco in 1895 and showed no tendencies during her\nyoung womanhood to live within the narrow corridor of risk laid out\nfor her sex. After studying art in San Francisco, she moved to New\nYork to take classes in architecture and design. In 1927, she\nembarked on a tour of Europe with her friend Consuela Kanaga, a\nnews photographer. A year went by, and when the women were bored\nwith the Continent they headed for North Africa.\n\n   It was on a train platform in Tunisia in 1928 that Dahl, 32,\nspotted her future husband, a sculptor from Tennessee named Meyer\nWolfe. ``She saw him,'' Irving Solero, who befriended Dahl-Wolfe in\n1978, recalled, ``and said, `That's for me.''' The two married that\nsame year.\n\n   Without fail, those who knew Dahl-Wolfe remark on the intense\nbond she and her husband shared. ``They lived together nonstop, 24\nhours a day,'' said Solero, who spent time with the couple in their\nFrenchtown, N.J., home, known as the Creamery. ``They fought all\nthe time, but a fight would erupt for five seconds and then it was\nover.'' Wolfe would travel with his wife, typically picking her up\nfor lunch during out-of-town shoots.\n\n   ``When he died at 88 she was self-abandoned,'' Mary Jane\nRussell, a friend and favorite model of Dahl-Wolfe's, said\nrecently. ``Her mourning was coupled with anger: `How could he have\nleft me? Why couldn't I be first?'''\n\n   While she was close to Russell, her relationships with others in\nthe Harper's Bazaar orbit were more complex. Well into the '70s and\n'80s, Dahl-Wolfe would talk about her former colleague Avedon ``as\nthough he were a kid,'' Solero said, adding, ``She'd say, `He has a\nlong way to go.'''\n\n   Lillian Bassman, whose impressionistic photographs began\nappearing in Bazaar around 1950, said that Dahl-Wolfe repeatedly\ntried to have her fired. In the mid-'40s, when Bassman was still\nworking in the magazine's art department as an apprentice, Carmel\nSnow sent her to Paris to try to find photographers who had worked\nfor Bazaar before the war. Dahl-Wolfe was so irritated at the\nprospect of competition, Bassman said, that she complained to Snow\nthat the art-director-in-training had been maligning her. Snow\nswiftly dispatched Bassman to the country and out of the way. ``It\nwas a testimony to Louise's stature at the magazine,'' Bassman\nsaid. After that, their relationship was ``a mess,'' she added.\n\n   With underlings in the fashion department, Dahl-Wolfe often\nplayed the taskmaster. Some 50 years ago, the fashion editor Polly\nMellen traveled to Jamaica with Dahl-Wolfe for a shoot and recalled\nwaking up every morning at 4:30 to braid the hair that would\neventually be cranked into the photographer's signature bun. ``In\nmy growing years, she was one of the few people who really formed\nme,'' Mellen said. ``She taught me extreme discipline.'' And\ndemonstrated a certain largesse as well. When Mellen left Bazaar to\nmarry in 1952, Dahl-Wolfe gave her a going-away party and took her\nwedding pictures. ``If she was on your side, you were most\nfortunate,'' Mellen said.\n\n   After Dahl-Wolfe left Bazaar, she worked briefly for Vogue\nbefore relinquishing photography in 1960, saying that advertisers\nhad gained too much influence over magazines. But however\nfrustrated she had become with what she saw as the\ncommercialization of magazines, she was never the sort who demanded\nthat some notion of artistic vision take precedence over the\nbusiness of showing off clothes. One hallmark of her thousands of\npublished images, 86 Bazaar covers among them, is that the gowns\nand bathing suits and ski clothes are always visible front and\ncenter. ``She worked for the magazine because she showed the\nfrocks,'' said Martin Harrison, a curator and historian of\nphotography. ``The models were good-looking, and it was a great\ntime for American fashion.''\n\n   Even Harrison, a detractor, admits that Dahl-Wolfe had a talent\nfor color. In her effort to show garments to their best advantage,\nshe would typically go to the printing press where Bazaar was\nchurned out and nudge engravers to change a blue backdrop to, say,\na yellow one if it made a dress look better. ``It was almost as if\nshe were a set designer,'' said Christopher Greene, who produced\nprints from Dahl-Wolfe's negatives late in her life.\n\n   While Dahl-Wolfe might flinch at the sort of images that today\nfill the pages of avant-garde fashion magazines like Dazed and\nConfused, the striking, saturated colors that are their trademark\nhark back, in some sense, to her.
