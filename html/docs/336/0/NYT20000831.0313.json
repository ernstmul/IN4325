Bender\n      c. 2000 Cox News Service\n\n   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ A $10,000 alpaca was found half-eaten\njust outside of Grand Junction Thursday morning, the victim of a\nyoung bear's exquisite midnight snack.\n\n   The bear attacked and devoured Mac, one of Kathy McKinley's\nalpacas, then leaped the corral fence and headed across the street\ninto a corn field. The Division of Wildlife set a bear trap in the\ncorral later in the afternoon, hoping the bear would return to\nfinish its treat.\n\n   ``I can't afford to have a bear eat all my animals,'' McKinley\nsaid. McKinley and her husband, Steve, own Mesa Llamas and Alpacas.\nThey own 17 llamas and alpacas worth a total of more than $200,000.\n\n   An alpaca looks like a smaller version of its cousin, the llama,\nand is bred for its expensive fur.\n\n   A late spring freeze and dry conditions this summer have bears\ncoming down from the mountains in a search for food.\n\n   The Colorado Division of Wildlife has relocated 22 bears from\nthe Grand Valley this year and 10 others have been killed by\nprivate property owners. The department receives about 12 phone\ncalls a day reporting bears in the city, said Steve Yamashita, area\nwildlife supervisor for the DOW.\n\n   This bear, however, was the first to kill livestock or cause\nserious damage in the valley.\n\n   McKinley did not hear anything during the night, but her\nneighbor, Don Hauer, did.\n\n   ``There was five or six seconds of fairly intense noises but\nthey always fight like that,'' Hauer said. ``It stopped after a few\nseconds and I thought, 'That's the end of that.'''\n\n   McKinley found the carcass about 7 a.m. and called the Mesa\nCounty Sheriff's Department. She was referred to the DOW.\n\n   The DOW ``said they wouldn't come because I didn't see the\nbear,'' McKinley said.\n\n   What McKinley did see was one of her favorite alpacas, minus\nnearly the entire right side of its body.\n\n   ``We've taken him to parades and to birthday parties, it's\nreally sad,'' McKinley said. ``Even the fur and the bones are\ngone.''\n\n   A coyote also could have killed Mac, but McKinley was convinced\nthe killer was a bear because of a large scat pile, about 50 feet\naway from the carcass, surrounded by bear prints.\n\n   Hauer, a manager in U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis' Grand Junction\noffice, said he called Russell George, the DOW's incoming new\ndirector.\n\n   ``If there's a bear that's come this close and with all the\nreported sightings, you would think the Division of Wildlife would\nbe out here quick,'' Hauer said. ``She's got insurance on these\nanimals. Common courtesy would be for the sheriff's department to\nat least come take a look.''\n\n   If there is no immediate threat of a visible bear, the DOW will\nnot rush to the scene, Yamashita said.\n\n   ``We have a two-strike policy here,'' Yamashita said. ``If we\nhave to relocate a bear we tag it and if it's found again we\neuthanize it. If at all possible we try not to give it its first\nstrike.''\n\n   Yamashita and Joe Gumber, district supervisor for the\ndepartment, arrived at McKinley's house about 11:30 a.m. They\ndetermined it was indeed a bear that killed the animal.
