He is flicking a small net on a stick.\n\n   It's not butterflies he is chasing, it's bees.\n\n   His mission: to find out if yet another Los Angeles County\nneighborhood has been colonized by dangerous Africanized honey\nbees, to see if another black dot needs to be marked on the\ncounty's map of ``killer bee'' colonies.\n\n   Hurley is the county's lone bee inspector. In the battle to\ninform the public about Africanized honey bees, Hurley is part\nreconnaissance man, part scientist, part educator.\n\n   ``This isn't a job a lot of people are trying to get,'' he says.\n``I love this job. I think bees are fascinating.''\n\n   Hurley says he is happy to be teaching the public to avoid a\npotential danger while allaying their wildest fears.\n\n   ``The bees are a fact,'' he says. ``They're going to be a\nday-to-day reality in Los Angeles County. It's not the end of the\nworld.''\n\n   Hurley, 51, has short red hair going white on the fringes and\nthe ruddy complexion of a fair-skinned person who spends a lot of\ntime in the sun. He wears oversize squarish glasses and a badge on\nhis light green khaki shirt that says Inspector.\n\n   He grew up marveling at bugs and graduated in January 1975 from\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach with a bachelor's degree in\nentomology. He hired on with the county Department of Agricultural\nCommissioner as an inspector trainee and has been there in numerous\ncapacities ever since. He's been the bee inspector since summer\n1997.\n\n   On this day, he's at a small white stucco house in Artesia. At\nan opening in a side wall where an air conditioner might once have\nsat, from behind a piece of fiberboard meant to cover the gap, bees\nare coming and going. Nearby is a blossoming orange tree.\n\n   Hurley snares four to six bees in his net in several rapid\nswipes, then kneels on the concrete driveway and forces the bees\ninto a small plastic bottle filled with alcohol. They quickly die.\n\n   He knocks on the wall and taps on the fiberboard to draw more\nbees out. They don't act aggressive; they don't attack the way\nAfricanized bees are known to when they are defending a colony.\n\n   ``This is pretty mild,'' he says.\n\n   He collects more than 40 of the bees.\n\n   Tenant Guadalupe Lopez (a man) says in Spanish that he first saw\nthe bees two years ago, then they left. Then about a year ago they\nreturned.\n\n   ``I think there's honey in there,'' Lopez says, looking at the\nwall from which the bees are emerging.\n\n   ``There (ITAL) is (END ITAL) honey in there,'' Hurley says when\ntold of Lopez's remark. He estimates about 10,000 bees are in the\nwall, which are popular places for bees to call home.\n\n   Hurley tells Lopez the house's owner needs to hire a pest\ncontrol operator to remove the bees.\n\n   Hurley's next stop is a Long Beach house whose owner had told\ncounty officials she's seen numerous bees, dead and alive, on her\nproperty. But Hurley finds no evidence of a colony.\n\n   ``Bee careful!'' a GTE crew member working at the house jokingly\nwarns Hurley as he's heading back to his county truck.\n\n   Hurley shakes his head. ``If I had a nickel for every time I've\nheard that, I could retire,'' he says.\n\n   Hurley does get stung frequently, he says. Once he was taking a\ntelevision news crew out with him. He was wearing black socks. He\ndidn't put rubber boots on. He was stung six to eight times on each\nankle.\n\n   ``The swelling went down within a couple days,'' he says.\n\n   Only after the incident, he adds, did his predecessor tell him\nthat bees attack black because it's the color of the snout of\nanimals, such as bears, that will eat their honey.\n\n   Hurley uses a Benadryl ``pencil'' to reduce the swelling, pain\nand itching that accompany bee stings. ``I keep it in the truck,''\nhe says.\n\n   Hurley loves being outdoors.
