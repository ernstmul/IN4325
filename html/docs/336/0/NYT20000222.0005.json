Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo\nTheater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged on Monday night\nin the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley\nattacking the vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and\nGore caustically describing Bradley as a ``desperate'' candidate\nintent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.\n\n   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session\nbegan, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an\nattack on their opponent. It was politics as spectacle, produced in\nan 87-year-old theater that is better known for the music of\nCharlie Parker and James Brown than debates between men seeking to\nbe president.\n\n   ``What you've seen is an elaborate, what I call Gore Dance,''\nBradley said, showing none of his earlier resistance to the attack\nas he mocked his opponent standing just feet away when the subject\nturned to the two men's position on registering hand guns. ``It's a\ndance to avoid facing up to your conservative record on guns.''\n\n   ``Senator Bradley,'' Gore responded, ``a couple of days ago,\nyour campaign said that you wanted to get some things off your\nchest. Well, since then you've made personal attack after personal\nattack. The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They\ndo divide us as Democrats.''\n\n   He added: ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're\ntrying to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down.''\n\n   Bradley, speaking to a mostly black audience, repeatedly\nattacked Gore for voting in 1981 in Congress to overturn an\nInternal Revenue Service ruling that would forbid tax exemptions to\nprivate schools whose enrollment did not reflect the racial\nenrollment of the community they were involved in. Early in the\ndebate, Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which he said included\na stack of the bills Gore had supported, and tried to thrust them\ninto Gore's hand.\n\n   The gesture was reminiscent of what Gore had attempted to do to\nat an earlier debate, on ``Meet the Press,'' when he challenged\nBradley to agree to foreswear any more political advertising.\nBradley ignored Gore's hand that Sunday morning, and Gore returned\nthe gesture on Monday night.\n\n   Gore noted that the bill Bradley referred to dealt with quotas,\nand that it had been approved by an overwhelming majority in\nCongress, with the votes of most Democrats. And trying to turn the\ntables on Bradley on another issue of concern to this audience,\nGore questioned why Bradley had voted against expanding the number\nof broadcast franchises available to minorities.\n\n   Bradley ignored Gore's challenge, turning back to the vote ``to\npreserve tax-exempt status for schools like Bob Jones that racially\ndiscriminate.''\n\n   The exchange was emblematic of a debate, sponsored by Time and\nCNN, that repeatedly seemed on the verge of running out of control,\nboth because of the candidates on stage and a particularly rowdy\naudience that offered the candidates a memorable image of New York\npolitics at its most insolent.\n\n   ``Time, time, time,'' the moderator, Bernard Shaw, said\nrepeatedly as Gore, in particular, attempted to respond to Bradley,\nwho was by far more aggressive than he has ever been before.\n\n   ```Look, Mr. _ Mr. Moderator, and as a point of personal\nprivilege, can I respond to that?'' Gore asked.\n\n   ``According to the rules the rules agreed to by both your\nstaffs, you cannot, sir,'' Shaw responded, to a swell of laughs\nfrom the 1,500-seat hall.\n\n   At another point, an audience member bellowed at Gore when a\nquestion was raised about the environment. ``Vice President Gore,\nif you support environmental justice what are you doing about the\nfact that $500,000 of your money . . .'' He was drowned out by loud\nyells from the audience, leaving the candidates standing in awkward\nsilence.\n\n   By any measure, this was the toughest presidential debate\ninvolving Republicans or Democrats this year. Again and again,\nBradley attacked Gore as a conservative Democrat, with a suspect\nhistory on affirmative action, abortion and gun control. Gore\nresponded by portraying Bradley as desperate and untrustworthy,\nasserting that his health care program endangered the elderly and\naides patients.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   At times, it seemed unlikely that anyone in the audience _ or\nwatching on television _ could follow the details of the charges\nthat Gore and Bradley threw at one another. At one point, Bradley\nreferred, rather obliquely, to a page in the book ``All Too\nHuman,'' by George Stephanopoulus, Clinton's former senior aide, to\nassert that Gore had worked in the administration to undermine\naffirmative action. Gore repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the\nprogram last night.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly\ncritical time for Bradley, whose campaign nationally _ and in New\nYork, a state where he had once been seen as posing a powerful\nchallenge to Gore, _ has seemed increasingly adrift.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Bradley's supporters viewed Monday night's session as a chance,\narguably one of his last before New York and several other crucial\nstates hold primaries on March 7, to effectively put his campaign\nback on the map.\n\n   Blacks made up 16 percent of the electorate in the 1992\nDemocratic primary in New York. President Clinton won 52 percent of\nthe black vote, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls\nat the time was key to his winning the three-way race with 41\npercent of the vote.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   nn\n\n   It was the second time that Gore and Bradley have appeared at a\ndebate devoted to black issues. The audience on Monday night was\nalmost entirely black, invited by community and church\norganizations. And the first question was posed by the Rev. Al\nSharpton, who suggested two weeks ago that the two Democratic\ncandidates for president hold a campaign on racial issues in a\nblack community.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Gore and Bradley agreed on a few things. They both denounced the\nflying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina, drawing a\ndistinction from either one of the Republicans who they might face\nin November. Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain\nof Arizona have declined to condemn South Carolina for flying the\nflag.\n\n   They also joined, in response to a question from Sharpton, in\ndecrying the Amadou Diallo shooting case, describing it as evidence\nof racial insensitivity in police departments. Both candidates said\nthey would issue executive orders to ban so-called racial\nprofiling, in which police departments use race as a factor in\nevaluating the potential risk of a candidate.\n\n   ``But I also think it reflects racial profiling in the sense of\nracial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he\nsees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet\nin the hand of a black man as a gun,'' Bradley said.\n\n   The debate had barely begun when the two candidates began to\nsnipe at each other with unusual ferocity. The first question,\nposed by Sharpton, focused on what each candidate would do to ban\nracial profiling and prevent police brutality while keeping crime\nlow.\n\n   Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Gore did not\nsimply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an\nexecutive order, immediately, banning racial profiling. Gore said\nthat work, indeed, had begun to move in that direction. But he\nissued the first of numerous one-line zingers by firing back: ``You\nknow, racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator.''\n\n   The nastiness permeated the next few minutes, on issues ranging\nfrom possible reparations for slavery, to health care, to\ntechnology and education for African-Americans. Several times, Gore\ncriticized Bradley for failing to support legislation that would\nhave expanded the number of African-American and minority-owned\nbroadcasting outlets.\n\n   Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman, said Bradley wanted to\napproach this aggressively and came out swinging. ``We're loaded\nfor bear and we're going to go get it.''\n\n   In explaining the approach, he said ``Obviously the stakes are\nhigh, but there's a lot to swing at. People deserve a choice and we\npainted it.''\n\n   ``We've started a two-week mission,'' he said explaining that\nthis would be an all-out effort before the March 7.\n","Headline":"\nBRADLEY AND GORE TRADE JABS IN FIERCEST CAMPAIGN DEBATE \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo\nTheater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged on Monday night\nin the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley\nattacking the vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and\nGore caustically describing Bradley as a ``desperate'' candidate\nintent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.\n","\n   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session\nbegan, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an\nattack on their opponent.
