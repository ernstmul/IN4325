Times News Service clients)  \n By BARRY BURKHART  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   In the spring of 1996, the second-largest wildfire in Arizona\nhistory destroyed 60 square miles of vegetation near Four Peaks in\nTonto National Forest.\n\n   The Lone Wildfire didn't destroy everything. It missed six\nsquare miles in various green islands, which saved a number of\nanimals by offering protection and food.\n\n   But soon after the fire, ``We found out we didn't have any black\nbears,'' said Stan Cunningham, a research biologist for the Arizona\nGame and Fish Department. ``Even bears in the green islands were\ngone. What happened?''\n\n   Because of their mobility as compared with smaller mammals,\nbears and foxes escaped the fire for the most part. They just left.\nBut bears are creatures of habit and soon returned, even if just to\npass through.\n\n   After three years, it became evident that the bears were coming\nback in great numbers. A normal bear count would be about 1.3 per\nsquare mile. The count in the burned area is 7.3 bears per square\nmile.\n\n   ``That's the highest concentration in the U.S., except for\nAlaska when they're eating salmon,'' said Cunningham. ``There are\n10 to 12 per square mile there. Where there's food available,\nyou'll find bears.''\n\n   Unfortunately, after two consecutive wet years, La Nina has\ncreated the driest year on record. Wildlife once again faces severe\nproblems.\n\n   Cunningham was developing a research project on coyotes and\nbobcats in the Four Peaks area when the fire struck.\n\n   The agency responded by changing courses to see the fire's\neffect on predators. It received funds from one federal and one\nstate source, and Cunningham started the work.\n\n   ``Small mammals,'' Cunningham said, ``were hurt by the fire, but\nthey already were in bad shape because of drought.''\n\n   Bears barely suffered.\n\n   Because of their great mobility and adaptabily, bears and gray\nfoxes fared well and returned to the burned out area. Bobcats\ndidn't. They will eat only meat, and there wasn't much of that\naround. Bears and foxes have a wider range of possible food,\nincluding vegetation.\n\n   ``With the food shortage, males will come after cubs to eat\nthem,`` Cunningham said. ``Females may come after each other.\nFinally we'll see a reduction of adult populations.''\n\n   Few cubs survive the early months, and with food decreasing,\nit'll be worse this year. Most will be eaten.\n\n   Trapping is banned on public land in this state except for\nresearch reasons. Cunningham prefers to use cable leg snares to\ncatch and study the animals. The only bear hurt was a trapped one\nkilled by another bear.\n\n   Late last week, Cunningham and his assistant, Raul Vega, led\nreporters to a den in the burned area. The female had been equipped\nwith a radio collar so she could be traced.\n\n   Cunningham and Vega used radio telemetry equipment to find her\nden under a boulder field. Now the tough part began.\n\n   Most people believe that hibernating bears sleep all winter. In\nfact, they don't. They'll get up and move around.\n\n   When Cunningham crawled to mouth of the den, the female was\nsitting and looking at him while her two cubs suckled. Although he\nhas been victim of a mock attack, he's never been injured.\n\n   Vega loaded a large syringe with a combination of a muscle\nrelaxer and a tranquilizer, and Cunningham attached the syringe to\nthe tip of a metal rod.\n\n   Then he crawled into the den and jabbed the mother with the\nsyringe.\n\n   In time she was down, and Cunningham brought out the two cubs _\na male and female, each weighing nearly four pounds.
