And\nthat gave us problems.''\n\n   Big time.\n\n   The 17th-ranked Longhorns (9-3) dominated Baylor defensively on\nthe way to a convincing 71-43 victory last night before an\nannounced Erwin Center crowd of 10,495.\n\n   ``I liked it better when we were playing against cheerleaders,''\nBaylor coach Dave Bliss joked, referring to a games he coached in\nthe Southwest Conference at SMU when former Texas coach Bob\nWeltlich recruited a cheerleader when players were bailing out of\nhis program in his first season (1982-83).\n\n   Texas held Baylor to a 34.9 shooting percentage last night in\nhanding the Bears (9-3) their 19th consecutive Big 12 loss. The\nLonghorns forced 23 turnovers while holding the Bears to 22\nrebounds and limited the visitors to four points in the last 13\nminutes of the first half. Baylor twice was whistled for 35-second\nviolations and once could not get the ball over half-court in the\nrequired 10. And Texas held Baylor's top two scorers _ Stukes and\nTerry Black _ to a combined 27 points, nine below their combined\naverages.\n\n   ``Coach Barnes has been talking to us about what is going to be\nour identity,'' Texas point guard Ivan Wagner said. ``We've decided\nto make defense our identity.''\n\n   Asked if the Longhorns perhaps were trying to make a statement\nto No. 2 Connecticut, where Texas plays on Monday, Wagner said no.\n\n   ``No one was out to make a statement to UConn,'' he said.\n``Maybe to the rest of the Big 12 as to what they can expect night\nin and out. Hopefully, we got our point across.''\n\n   Texas held an opponent to less than 40 percent shooting for the\nsixth time this season and the 20th time in 44 games under Rick\nBarnes. Texas is 15-5 in those games, 6-0 this season.\n\n   ``Maybe I'm not a good offensive coach,'' Barnes said. ``But I\nbelieve in defense. I believe you can create offense with defense.\nDefense can be there every night and, if it is, you've got a\nchance. Defense can overcome turnovers, poor free throw shooting _\na multitude of sins.''\n\n   Texas broke from a 13-all tie to outscore the Bears 17-4 and\ntake a 30-17 halftime lead, the lowest point total in a half for an\nopponent this season.\n\n   Center Chris Mihm led a balanced attack with 15 points and eight\nrebounds in 27 minutes. Nine Longhorns played at least 12 minutes\nand no one played more than Wagner's 28. That is in stark contrast\nto last season, when four members of the eight-player rotation on\nthe Big 12 regular-season champions averaged more than 31 minutes\neach.\n\n   ``Our bench was the difference in this game,'' Barnes said.\nnn\n","Headline":null,"Text":["\n   AUSTIN _ The question was whether] Baylor was trying to shorten\nthe game, or was Texas' defense just too tall?\n","\n   ``We came in trying to push the ball and get the quickest shot\nwe could,'' said Bears guard Tevis Stukes, who frequently was\nlooking for an open man with 10 seconds left on the shot clock.\n``But they kept moving our offense out to the half-court line.
