FOX' BOASTS INSPRING SOUNDS OF PICKER\n\n (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) \nBy REED JOHNSON \nc.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  \n\n   LOS ANGELES _      Growing up outside New York City in the late\n1950s, Tobias Picker couldn't stomach most so-called ``children's\nliterature.'' About the only authors of that ilk he could abide\nwere A.A. Milne and ``a little bit of Dr. Seuss.''\n\n   But there was one children's author the precocious Picker rated\nhighly: Roald Dahl, who gave the world ``James and the Giant\nPeach,'' ``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' and other\nprepubescent classics.\n\n   Only thing was, Picker didn't actually read those books until\nlater in life. Instead he was drawn to Dahl's adult fiction, a\ntaste he'd acquired from his parents.\n\n   ``They were big readers, and they loved his writing,'' says the\nsoft-spoken 45-year-old composer. ``They just loved his wicked,\ntwisted, wonderful, wry (style) _ they thought he was a genius. And\nHitchhock discovered it also on his `Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'\nand dramatized, I believe, more than one Dahl story. I used to\nwatch that show as a kid.''\n\n   From Hitchcock to Dahl to L.A. Opera might seem a surreal\nsequence. But it's one that will be completed tonight when Picker's\noperatic adaptation of Dahl's children's story, ``Fantastic Mr.\nFox,'' premieres at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.\n\n   With a libretto by Donald Sturrock and sets and costumes by\nBritish political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, ``Fantastic Mr. Fox''\nwas conceived as a colorful musical morality tale that, like Dahl's\nbook, could speak to adults without talking down to children.\n\n   Its story concerns a family of clever foxes who are being\nhounded by three grotesque English farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean,\nwho are bent on exterminating them. Canadian baritone Gerald Finley\nstars as the wily vulpine patriarch. The cast also includes Los\nAngeles native mezzo-soprano Suzanna Guzman as Mrs. Fox.\n\n   A key to the project, according to its production team, was\npreserving Dahl's multiple layers of meaning and his subversive\nedge. ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' can be read as a satire of human greed\nand brutality, with the animals in the story representing a kind of\noppressed underclass. But the story also works on a simpler comic\nlevel.\n\n   ``He (Dahl) had a delight in the naughty,'' says Sturrock,\n``which most adults can share with children, and in saying things\nwhich shouldn't be said, and in seeing things as they are rather\nthan how they seem, which I think a child can immediately\nunderstand.\n\n   ``A lot of his adult stories are based on that `What if _ what\nif things aren't what they appear to be?' or `What if somebody said\nthis, but was actually doing something else?'''\n\n   Picker said the project appealed to him in part because it was\nmiles removed from his first opera, ``Emmeline,'' which premiered\ntwo years ago at Santa Fe Opera to considerable critical oohs and\naahs.\n\n   Inspired by a novel by Judith Rossner (``Looking for Mr.\nGoodbar''), ``Emmeline'' was based on a true story about Emmeline\nMosher, a textile worker in 19th-century rural Maine who was\nseduced by her boss and forced to give up her infant son. Twenty\nyears later, she met and married a young drifter, only to discover\nthat he was the very son she'd abandoned.\n\n   Invoking the Oedipus legend as seen through Jocasta's eyes,\n``Emmeline,'' with a libretto by poet J.D. McClatchy, had the shape\nand structure of classical tragedy. Reviewing New York City Opera's\nproduction last April, the New York Times critic Bernard Holland\nwrote, ``The City Opera should put `Emmeline' in its permanent\nrepertory. It is a model of its kind.''\n\n   But the opera's downbeat subject took a toll on Picker, who says\nthat after ``Emmeline'' he was ready to work in a brighter musical\npalette.\n\n   ``After `Emmeline,' I wanted the freedom that this (`Fantastic\nMr. Fox') allowed me of all these different characters and\npossibilities and playfulness and fun and comedy _ the challenge of\ndoing something funny, which is very, very hard to do.''\n\n   The idea for an opera of ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' came from a 1993\nlunch chat between librettist Sturrock and Peter Hemmings, general\ndirector of L.A. Opera. Sturrock, who was in town shooting a BBC\ndocumentary on tenor Placido Domingo, mentioned that he'd been\ncommissioning some orchestral works based on the writings of Dahl,\nwhom Sturrock had befriended late in the author's life.\n\n   Hemmings told him: ``If ever you think of doing an opera, let me\nknow.'' Two years later, Sturrock began writing the libretto.\n\n   Then, while trying to decide on a composer, Sturrock and Dahl's\nwidow, Liccy (short for Felicity), attended ``Emmeline's'' world\npremiere in Santa Fe.\n\n   ``When I heard `Emmeline' in Santa Fe, it made a very big\nimpression on me,'' says Sturrock. ``He (Picker) is a composer that\ncan craft an opera in a very impressive fashion and also write\nsomething that can very much move an audience.''\n\n   The final piece of the equation was hiring Scarfe, at Hemmings'\nsuggestion. Known for his fanciful production designs for the\nfeature films ``Pink Floyd: The Wall'' and Disney's animated\n``Hercules,'' Scarfe previously had teamed with L.A. Opera for its\n1993 production of ``The Magic Flute'' (restaged here last season).\n\n   While the plot of Dahl's original story has been condensed,\nSturrock has compensated by fleshing out several secondary\ncharacters.\n\n   ``The characters are strengthened, and each one has a\npersonality of their own,'' Picker says. ``Hedgehog _ actually\nthere's a family of hedgehogs _ and I think Donald created Miss\nHedgehog, the spinster, the lonely spinstress, who at the end\nfinally finds the animal of her dreams in Mr. Porcupine. And they\nsing a love duet. And there's a fox trot!''\n\n   Ba-DUM-bum!\n\n   ``Fantastic Mr. Fox'' arrives at a moment when a handful of\nAmerican composers, several of them just entering their peak years,\nhave been writing operas. The past two seasons alone have seen the\ndebuts of ``Emmeline,'' Tod Machover's ``Brain Opera'' and Michael\nTorke's ``King of Hearts,'' plus Andre Previn's adaptation of ``A\nStreetcar Named Desire,'' which premiered earlier this season in\nSan Francisco.\n\n   Like many of his contemporaries, Picker spent much of his early\ncomposing career studying under an older generation of devout\nserialists. His teachers included such godfathers of atonality as\nElliott Carter at the Juilliard School, Charles Wuorinen at the\nManhattan School of Music and Milton Babbitt at Princeton\nUniversity.\n\n   But Picker's subsequent work has embraced the more melodic vein\nof the American vernacular and the warmer sounds of\nneo-romanticism. In addition to song cycles, three symphonies and\nconcertos for violin, viola, piano and oboe, he also composed ``The\nEncantadas,'' a ``concerto'' for actor and orchestra inspired by a\ntext by Herman Melville.\n\n   ``It was deliberate, and it was unconscious at the same time,''\nPicker says of his gradual movement toward opera. ``I knew that\neventually I was going to have to write opera.
