Kristen Haberin was cooking\nsoup in a one-burner propane stove.\n\n   They had been on the road for hours, and about mid-morning they\nhad passed out of Maine's well-worn tourist route along the craggy\ncoast and entered the outback region of the state known as the\n``North Woods.''\n\n   Fewer cars along the road now. As they pushed north the seafood\nrestaurants and factory outlet stores gave way to a country store\nabout every 10 miles _ half a day's ride by wagon, which was the\ntransportation when these little all-purpose stores were the only\ncommercial enterprises in the vast and brooding landscape.\n\n   Eventually, the road itself ended, and for a dusty, rumbly hour\nthe couple were driving the gravel packed roads and passing town\nline signs that read ``T3-R9'' (for township location).\n\n   Now Heberin and Lankton had their soup and looked out at the\nsky. Most views showed an improvement from the morning's overcast,\nbut on one side, blocking out the sky for a mile above them, rose\nthe dark immensity of Katahdin.\n\n   ``We've camped all over, but never this far away,'' said\nHaberin. The couple, from Coventry Conn., had always heard of\nKatahdin (Kette-Adene, Abenaki for ``Greatest Mountain), the\n5,267-foot high northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Last\nweek they made the long push upcountry to see it and the camp\naround it.\n\n   Where hundreds of thousands of tourists annually visit Mt.\nWashington in New Hampshire's White Mountains _ which features an\nauto road and cog railway to the top, with endless tourist\namusements and shopping spread around the base _ only a fraction as\nmany get into Maine's mile high peak and the vast outback beyond\nit, about 300 miles north of Boston.\n\n   Shortly outside of Greenville (west) or Millinocket (east), the\npaved roads abruptly give way to gravel-packed logging roads, and\nfor the next hundred miles (Katahdin is actually central Maine) the\nland becomes a wild uninhabited chain of lakes, rivers, mountains,\nand dense forest land. Under state control, it is called the\nAllagash Wilderness Waterway, replacing the older North Woods tag,\nwhich natives still use.\n\n   ``Most people who come up here are pretty serious outdoorsmen,\nbut not all,'' says ranger Pete McFarland. ``Sometimes people climb\nup Katahdin underestimating how big it is and what a long climb it\ncan be. They get up there drenched with perspiration, then a shower\ncomes up and thw wind blows, and they're up there shivering and too\ntired to climb down.''\n\n   Just last week, park rangers had to call in a helicopter rescue\nfor a woman who, shortly after knee surgery, tried to take on\nKatahdin.\n\n   ``It just looks so pretty up there a lot of people get\ndeceived,'' said another ranger at the Baxter station. Indeed, the\ntrek up to Katahdin's summit can be accomplished by most reasonably\nhealthy people. Yet, rangers point out, the turnaround climb is a\nseven-hour proposition, and any trek up the mountain should be\ncarefully prepared.\n\n   Katahdin and Baxter State Park, though a large tract in itself\nat 315 square miles, is only one relatively small corner of the\nNorth Woods, which even in high season (after black flies and\nbefore the snow) are sparsely populated by generally only the\nhard-core outdoors enthusiasts.\n\n   Some, like Jack Richards and his 16-year-old son Jack Jr., come\nto canoe. From the southernmost point of the Allagash at Telos\nLanding on Telos Lake to Allagash Village on the St. John River 98\nmiles to the north, lies perhaps the longest single organized canoe\ntrip in America.\n\n   ``You don't have to get out there very far before you know\nyou're alone,'' says the senior Richards, who has made several such\ntreks with his son, but never covered the whole distance. ``Some\none of these summers, we have to plan the whole thing and just go.\nOr it's always going to be out there nagging on me.''\n\n   Others, like the Connecticut couple, hike and ride mountain\nbikes, though the latter activity is controlled by the park\nservice, which guards strictly against environmental damage.\n\n   ``We wanted to take mountain bikes up to the Allagash,'' says\nLankton. ``But they won't let you on the trails up there _ with\ngood reason. So we'll ride the logging roads down here.''\n\n   Over 90 percent of the North Woods is owned by pulp paper\ncompanies, which have checkpoints to log in visitors to the region.\nSo, too, Baxter checks in all cars and asks people their plans _\nsimple safety precautions, they say, in case people get lost. At\nany one time a thousand people are in the park overnight, and the\nrangers know the inevitable call can come any night _ someone lost\non the mountain.\n\n   But down in the lowlands, where hundreds of miles of logging\nroads crisscross the forests and bogs, getting lost is as easy as\nforgetting the last three forks in the road. The very logging roads\nthat make almost every lake and mountain accssible by car can\nquickly become as tractless and confusing as the wilderness itself.\n\n   ``I've been lost on these roads before,'' admits Harlan Reed, a\nfishing guide with a camp on the Penobscot River. ``At least when\nyou're in a canoe you know where the river's going and it's pretty\nhard to get lost. Even hiking trails aren't bad. But these roads in\nthe woods _ you can drive all day and get more lost every mile you\ngo.''\n\n   One of the great draws of the region is the wildlife. Black bear\n(the state university's fighting symbol, despite the shyness of the\nanimal), coyote, white-tail deer, and jackrabbits are common\nanimals. The woods ring with the call of loons and the\nwhite-throated sparrow _ a bird heard only brielfly in lower New\nEngland during the spring migration north.\n\n   But the one animal everyone wants to see has become the\nunofficial state symbol _ moose. ``If I talk to 50 campers a week,\n49 of them will ask how do they get to see a moose. The state even\nhas a book out about it,'' says Reed, who has been coming to the\nNorth Woods most of his adult life.\n\n   Indeed, in Maine's vast outback, spotting moose is as easy as\nrising at dawn and staking out a bog or small stream. Evening hours\nare also good. After years of clear-cutting the pine forests by\nloggers, what is left are growing hardwood thickets which state\nbiologists term ``the great salad bowl'' for moose.\n\n   Back at the visitors center at Baxter is a blackboard on which\nvisitors log in latest moose sightings, such as one last week ``7/8\n_ Really huge bull moose at Abol Stream.''\n\n   While the fishing in some areas is excellent _ indeed, Penobscot\nRiver brown trout fishing is legendary, as is Moosehead _ it is at\nbest only part of the picture for most travelers to the Maine\nbackcountry.\n\n   Hiking, canoeing, and kayaking are the most popular activities.\nBut on the two big rivers that flow out of Moosehead (the largest\nlake in the continental US contained within the borders of a single\nstate) the last remaining whitewater in the northeast gave rise 25\nyears ago to the rafting business.\n\n   Purist outdoor enthusiasts have scoffed at using the rivers for\namusement park rides for casual visitors. But with low\nenvironmental impact, rafting has come to be viewed in a more\nbenign light by most over the years as simply another recreational\nuse of the rivers, and good clean fun.\n\n   Since Wayne Hockmeyer founded Northern Outdoors 23 years ago on\nthe Penobscot as well as the Kennebec, Dead River in Maine, and the\nHudson in New York, an offbeat amusement has grown into a sport\nthat draws tens of thousands each year.\n\n   On a typical summer day, about 1,000 rafters will bump, splash,\nand scream their way down through famous rapids known as Cribworks\nand Magic Falls before the rafts are landed in a wilderness setting\nfor a cookout. Then the afternoon session, followed by a video\nshowing of the days' activities, gives rafters a full day.\n\n   ``I've got a family myself,'' says Jim Yearwood, manager and\npart-owner of Northern Outdoors, ``and I'd consider this a very\naffordable vacation. We sometimes combine rafting with days of\nkayaking, fishing, rock climbing and hiking.''\n\n   Such packaged trips appeal often to groups who want to vacation\ntogether at a group rate, says Yearwood, with planning left to\nprofessionals. Registered Maine guides working for Northern\nOutdoors accompany the trips on the river and into the backwoods.\n\n   ``It's a safe way to experience the wilderness in all aspects,''\nsays Yearwood.\n\n   Rafting took grew so fast through the last two decades on the\nfew whitewater rivers left in the northeast that the state had to\nstep in and regulate the numbers. The current limit allows 1,000\nrafters on the river weekdays and 800 on Saturdays.\n\n   In the decade from 1985 to 1995, rafters on Maine's three\nnorthern rivers increased from 44,540 to 80,337 annually, according\nto state figures. ``We've settled in at about that figure now,''\nsays Yearwood, exaplining that the several rafting outfitters had\nto work out schedules and quotas.\n\n   Some old-timers in the outback still consider rafting a rather\nfrivilous activity, compared to traditional uses such as fishing\nand canoeing. The highly packaged rafting trips, they say, are\nlittle more than thrill-seeking ammusements compared with the\nsubtler, more traditional ways to appreciate the northern\nwilderness.\n\n   ``I know it helps bring in money,'' says Ron Ewell, a logger who\nhas spent his life between Quebec and Millinocket. ``But it sure\nhas changed the river. We used to have river drives with timber,\nand now it sometimes looks as thick as that with these rafts.''\n\n   But no one has viewed rafting as a serious threat to the\nwilderness here. Not compared to the potential development of\nMoosehead Lake, where one of the principal land owners, South\nAfrica Pulp and Paper, is trying to sell off nearly 100,000 acres\nof forest land this summer, including 60-miles of Moosehead Lake\nshorefront.\n\n   Back in the high-flying '80's, realty developers did manage to\nbesmirch some of the land around Moosehead with unimpeded and\nhaphazard building in the ``vacation home'' market.\n\n   This time around, if South African Pulp and Paper, and others,\ndo unload its wilderness land to investors, state and federal\nplanners in Maine vow to fight for regulations and protection of\nthe North Woods.\n\n   An editorial in the Moosehead Messenger in Greenville, the\ngateway town to the wilderness, calls for the public puchase of the\nland ``to protect ourselves from the whims of Wall Street.''\n\n   Yet there is a sense of the inevitable. Says Paul Deitz, a new\nlandowner along the Moosehead shore, as he looked out over the lake\nfrom the top of Squaw Mountain one evening last week:\n\n   ``It's just too beautiful here, too easy to reach, and there's\nso much of it ... everyone wants a piece of a place like this. Once\nthe people start coming and it catches on, there'll be no stopping\nthem.''\n","Headline":"\nTHE TRAVELING GETS LONELY IN NORTHERN MAINE \n","Text":["\n   BAXTER STATE PARK, Maine _ George Lankton was raising a roof in\nthe form of a tarp strung from trees.
