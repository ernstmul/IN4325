Times News Service   \n\n   The Serbian government on Wednesday seized control of the main\nopposition television station, accusing it of advocating an\nuprising.\n\n   Opposition politicians, taken by surprise, talked of the\nbeginning of a dictatorship in Serbia, under Yugoslav President\nSlobodan Milosevic. They called for an immediate protest rally.\n\n   The station that was seized, Studio B, belonged to the city of\nBelgrade and also provided a frequency for the independent radio\nstation B2-92, which was effectively silenced.\n\n   Studio B was controlled by the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk\nDraskovic, the ruling party in the city and the single largest\nopposition party in the country. Studio B, although lavish in its\ncoverage of Draskovic, is the most important opposition television\noutlet in Serbia, able to reach up to half the population in normal\ntimes, and its seizure is an attack on Draskovic.\n\n   Since December, its broadcasts have frequently been jammed, and\nit has been one of the main targets of an increasing series of\nfines and lawsuits aimed at the independent media and independent\npublishing houses.\n\n   The station remained on the air Wednesday, showing\npro-government material and the state news. The government named a\npresumed loyalist, Ljubisav Aleksic, as the new editor and general\nmanager. On the frequency given to Radio B2-92 there was music.\n\n   The new management of Studio B broadcast pictures of the empty\nnewsroom, highlighting cabinets full of expensive foreign liquor, a\nBritish flag and signs from the United Nations and SFOR\npeacekeepers in Bosnia, underlining official accusations that the\nopposition works for the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia last\nyear.\n\n   The official charge against the station, in an order signed by\nradical nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian deputy\nprime minister, was that Studio B had called for a violent\noverthrow of the constitutional order and had incited people to\nriot. For that, the government said, it seized control and\nownership of the station.\n\n   ``This is the beginning of dictatorship,'' said Ognjen\nPribicevic, a top aide to Draskovic. ``Now it's up to the people of\nSerbia to see how many show up to defend Studio B. The next step\ncould be a ban on political parties.''\n\n   Pribicevic said the opposition is appealing to the United States\nand to Russia, an ally of Milosevic, ``to condemn this attack\nagainst the Serbian people, especially when the Yugoslav foreign\nminister has just been in Moscow.''\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Another opposition leader, Vladan Batic, said: ``The government\nhas imposed an informal state of emergency. This indicates an\nintroduction of a civil war.''\n\n   An opposition politician, Zarko Korac, said: ``The Serbian\nregime has opted for an open dictatorship. It is up to the citizens\nof Serbia to respond and say whether they want to live in such a\nsociety.''\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Studio B director and editor-in-chief Dragan Kojadinovic denied\nthat the station has called for an uprising. ``I can say that this\nhas no legal or realistic foundations,'' he said. ``Studio B has\nnot called for any toppling of legally elected authorities. It only\nreported on political and other events.''\n\n   The head of the Association of Independent Electronic Media,\nVeran Matic, said that B2-92 was ``collateral damage'' in the\nclosings and that it was looking for backup broadcasting options.\nHe said the move was ``the most serious assault'' yet on\nindependent media.\n\n   Local and federal elections are due in Yugoslavia before the end\nof this year.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Draskovic and other members of the opposition have sometimes\nbeen intemperate in their language and have come close to calling\nfor a popular movement to sweep Milosevic from power without\nbenefit of elections. They have also called on the army and police\nto defect to the opposition and overthrow the government.\n\n   Last Friday, at a party rally in Ravna Gora, Draskovic said his\nparty would more strongly oppose ``the terror'' of the Milosevic\nregime. ``From today, we will not only defend ourselves by\nmeetings, speeches and statements, but by all means possible,'' he\nsaid. And when his supporters shot guns into the air, Draskovic\nsaid, ``Save your ammunition _ you'll need it.'' That rally was\nshown on Studio B.\n\n   Studio B has regularly broadcast Draskovic's charges that senior\ngovernment police and political officials conspired to kill him in\na car accident last October in which his brother-in-law and some\nbodyguards died.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The police moved at 2 a.m. to seize the building housing the\noffices and newsroom of Studio B. The police also locked the\noffices of B2-92 and Radio Indeks, in the same building, as well as\nthe offices of the largest independent newspaper, Blic.\n\n   Blic, which has a circulation of more than 220,000 copies, was\nalready being harassed by the government, with the state-owned\nBorba printing press refusing to print the paper on the grounds\nthat a press was broken.\n\n   Blic, which has been able to print only about half of its normal\ncirculation using two other printing houses, presumably will\ncontinue to appear, since it has no connection to Studio B.\n\n   But the private printing house that prints Glas Javnosti,\nanother independent newspaper, and has been printing some copies of\nBlic as well as the independent weeklies Nin and Vreme is also\nunder attack by the government for alleged financial\nirregularities. The printing house, ABC Grafika, has been ordered\nto vacate its premises, although it has appealed.\n\n   In recent days, especially after the murders of some senior\nofficials, including Bosko Perosevic, a senior member of\nMilosevic's party, Yugoslav authorities have increased their\nattacks on the opposition, labeling them traitors, terrorists and\nfascists.\n\n   The opposition, often divided, has lately shown signs of more\nunity. But after a successful rally in Belgrade last month, when\nmore than 150,000 people gathered, a second rally on Monday\nattracted fewer than 20,000. Government officials gloated and may\nhave taken the low turnout as a signal to move forward with this\ncrackdown and challenge to the opposition.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   nn\n\n   The government also increased its attacks on the student\norganization Otpor, which means Resistance, which has attracted\nmore serious political support in recent months.\n\n   In the last week, at least one journalist was accused of\nespionage, but was later released. And some 40 Otpor activists and\nother opposition figures have been detained in recent days for\n``informative talks'' with the police.\n\n   The only independent electronic media that could be heard in\nBelgrade on Wednesday was Radio Pancevo, based in an\nopposition-controlled town nearby. And there were concerns that the\ngovernment would try to move against the many small television and\nradio stations controlled by the cities where the opposition holds\npower.\n\n   Milosevic has typically been careful to keep to the letter of\nthe law, but he and his government now are acting more arbitrarily\nthan in the past. He has also generally allowed a zone of free\nspeech and independent newspapers and magazines that tend to preach\nto the converted. He often did so to please the West, but since the\nwar over Kosovo and his indictment on war crimes charges,\nMilosevic's motivation to satisfy Western requirements has been\nconsiderably diminished.\n\n   ``He did not begin as a dictator and has not been one,'' said\none opposition politician, asking for anonymity. ``But he may\nbecome one yet.''\n","Headline":"\nGOVERNMENT SEIZES INDEPENDENT MEDIA OUTLETS \n","Text":["\n   The Serbian government on Wednesday seized control of the main\nopposition television station, accusing it of advocating an\nuprising.\n","\n   Opposition politicians, taken by surprise, talked of the\nbeginning of a dictatorship in Serbia, under Yugoslav President\nSlobodan Milosevic.
