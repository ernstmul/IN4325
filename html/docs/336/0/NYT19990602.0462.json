A couple of the cubs were orphaned when their mother\nwas shot as a nuisance bear, she said. Several of the other cubs\nwere found thin and with coats in poor condition.\n\n   ``We don't know what happened to the mother. They wouldn't have\nsurvived the winter if we hadn't rehabilitated them,'' she said.\n\n   Those bears had to be sedated so they could be bathed to get rid\nof mange and they were also given medicine to fight ringworm. They\nwere nourished back to health with fruits, mostly vegetables and\nsome dry dog food.\n\n   Keepers were careful to avoid habituating the bears to humans.\n\n   ``We don't go in with the bears,'' Dyson said. ``They don't see\nus giving them food. We try not to stand there and stare at them.''\n\n   Occasionally, photographers are allowed to shoot pictures, but\notherwise there is normally no visual contact, Dyson said.\n\n   Bears that become too used to being around humans or, especially\nbears that associate food with humans, are considered more likely\nto become dangerous bears.\n\n   Things got crowded at times at the PAWS center this winter,\nDyson said, with close to 14 bears there at one time.\n\n   One of the 16 bears that came in during the year died under\nanaesthesia and another had to be killed because its leg was too\nmangled to be repaired after it was hit by a car.\n\n   One, which came from California early last year, was released\nlast summer. Two bears were released into the North Cascades two\nweeks ago.\n\n   Six were released during the winter. The center first induced\nhibernation by cutting back on their food, laying out straw for\ndenning material, and creating dark, quiet conditions. The bears\nwere then sedated and moved to suitable denning locations that had\nbeen found by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.\n\n   The five bears to be released on Thursday will travel across the\nmountains towards Wenatchee in a convoy to Pateros. Three will go\nto one area, and two will go to another area.\n\n   Four of the bears released during the winter wear radio collars\nand are being tracked.\n\n   ``They all seem to be doing fine,'' Dyson said.\n","Headline":"\nLAST GROUP OF REHABILITATED BEARS WILL BE RELEASED INTO WILD \n","Text":["\n   SEATTLE _ Five black bears, scrubbed and nourished after a\nwinter in a Lynnwood, Wash., rehabilitation facility, will be sent\nout into the world to fend for themselves on Thursday in Eastern\nWashington.\n","\n   They're the last five to be released of 16 that were taken in by\nthe PAWS Wildlife Center between March and December last year.\n","\n   Sixteen bears is well over the usual two or three the center\ngets each year, said Deb Dyson, PAWS rehabilitation manager.\n","\n   Wildlife experts told PAWS the reason for so many distressed\nbears last year was likely the poor berry crop in Eastern\nWashington caused by drought.\n","\n   Dyson also said that housing and business developments are\nencroaching on traditional bear habitat, creating problems for\nbears that use those areas.\n","\n   The five bears all came from the same area in Wenatchee, Wash.,\nDyson said.
