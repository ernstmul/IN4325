Times News Service   \n\n   The asthma epidemic visited Children's National Medical Center\none recent Friday, the day after a furious rainstorm kicked up\nallergens all over Washington. By 9 a.m., the emergency room, where\nchildren come in more often for failing lungs than for broken\nbones, was jumping. Harried nurses barked orders for the pharmacy\nto send more drugs. In bed after bed, young faces, all\nAfrican-American, were buried under clear plastic breathing masks.\n\n   John Thompson, a skinny, bright-eyed 8-year-old, was there,\nwatching Richard Scarry videos while sniffing steroids to relax his\nswollen airways. His mother, who had taken a bus and three subway\ntrains to get to the hospital, lost her pay that day. She had\nalready used all her sick leave to care for two asthmatic children.\n\n   Kyle Mosley, an athletic 13-year-old with a mouthful of braces,\nrested quietly in a room around the corner; he had woken up at 4\nthat morning, gasping for breath.\n\n   This is the other inner-city epidemic: asthma. The burden of\nAIDS on the poor and minorities has been well documented. Asthma is\nless deadly; it claims about 5,000 lives in the United States each\nyear. Yet the death statistics do not begin to tell the story of\nhow an unprecedented _ and unexplained _ explosion in asthma cases\nis suffocating the nation's poorest urban residents, especially\nchildren.\n\n   The rapid rise of asthma, in this country and in developed\nnations around the world, is one of the biggest mysteries in modern\nmedicine. The most striking increases, experts say, have occurred\nin Australia, where about one-quarter of all children have received\na diagnosis of asthma.\n\n   In the United States, the number of asthma sufferers has more\nthan doubled from 6.7 million in 1980 to an estimated 17.3 million\nin 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta. Of these, 4.8 million are children. Experts\nsay the increase is real. Although doctors do a better job of\ndiagnosing asthma now than they did in years past, that does not\nentirely explain the upward trend.\n\n   The epidemic cuts across racial and socioeconomic lines, but\nasthma is slightly more prevalent among blacks than among whites.\nScientists suspect that the difference may at least in part be\ngenetic.\n\n   But when public health officials measure rates of hospital\nadmissions, emergency-room visits and deaths, they find that black\nand Hispanic patients, particularly those who are poor, shoulder a\nmuch heavier burden.\n\n   No one knows why the disparity is so great, but experts have\nsome ideas. The poor tend to have less access to regular medical\ncare, are less able to afford the medications they need and are\nmore likely to be around environmental ``triggers'' that set off\nasthma attacks. Also, some researchers have found, families already\nunder great stress are less able to cope with the complicated daily\nregimen that asthma demands.\n\n   Asthma, a chronic, incurable disease of the airways, is\ncharacterized by intermittent episodes of wheezing, coughing and\nbreathlessness. During normal breathing, air flows freely in and\nout of the lungs. But during an asthma attack, the lining of the\nairways swells, muscles around the airways tighten and mucus clogs\nthe tiny air tubes in the lungs, making breathing difficult.\n\n   The attacks can be set off by pollen, dust and dust mites,\ncockroaches, stress, cold air, tobacco smoke, irritating chemical\nsmells, mold and mildew, respiratory infections or exercise.\n\n   Asthma sufferers can live a normal, unrestricted life, doctors\nsay, if they get the proper medication and stick to the daily\ntreatment and monitoring that the disease requires. But many\npatients do not get the medical supervision they need or do not\nfollow their drug regimens properly, and so, despite new and highly\neffective drugs to treat the disease, hospital admissions for\nasthma are increasing.\n\n   In 1995, the most recent year for which the government has\nfigures, blacks were two to three times as likely to die of asthma\nas whites. That same year, African-Americans paid four times as\nmany visits to emergency rooms for asthma as did whites.\n\n   In an effort to reverse the trends, the government is stepping\nup asthma research. In May, Donna Shalala, the secretary of health\nand human services, announced that the department would develop ``a\nstrategic plan'' for research into the causes of asthma and ways to\nlessen the burden on minorities and the poor.\n\n   In his proposed budget for next year, President Clinton has\nincluded $50 million in grants for states to test methods for\nimproving the health of children with asthma who are enrolled in\nthe Medicaid program. That is in addition to the $118 million the\nNational Institutes of Health plan to spend on asthma research.\n\n   Although the Clinton administration has made eliminating racial\ndisparities in disease one of its health priorities, asthma is not\non the list of six illnesses the government has identified for the\nfirst five years of the program. That is not because the racial gap\nis insignificant, the surgeon general said, but because experts\nhave no idea how to narrow it within the five years.\n\n   Ten years ago, scientists thought diesel exhaust and other\npollutants might be causing the asthma epidemic. Now, they believe\nthe picture is more complex. To begin with, asthma cases are\nsurging as pollution levels are declining.\n\n   Dr. Fernando Martinez, director of the Respiratory Sciences\nCenter at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said that scientists\nin Germany had studied two populations, East and West Germans, with\nsimilar genetic backgrounds but different environments, to\ndetermine whether different living conditions could be associated\nwith different rates of disease.\n\n   Experts had assumed that asthma would be more prevalent in the\nmore heavily industrialized and polluted East. But the study found\njust the opposite. It helped scientists to see that whatever caused\nasthma was probably separate from what triggered asthma attacks.\n\n   Typically, asthma appears before age 6. ``If we are going to\nunderstand not what triggers asthma but what causes asthma,''\nMartinez said, ``we have to look at the first years of life.''\n\n   Today, scientists are focusing on genetics. This month, a team\nat Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California reported the\ndiscovery of two genes that contribute to the development of\nasthma. Researchers are also looking at what happens to the immune\nsystem in early life.\n\n   nn\n\n   One of the most talked-about new theories is that the rise in\nasthma is related to improved hygiene. The idea is that babies are\nless likely to be exposed to viruses and bacteria, and without that\nexposure, their immune systems do not mature fully. The result is\nasthma.\n\n   That might explain why people who live on farms, or in rural\nareas, are less likely to develop asthma than people in cities.\nPerhaps, said Dr. Sonia Buist, an asthma expert at Oregon Health\nSciences University in Portland, it is because people on farms are\nmore likely to be exposed to soil organisms, and that exposure\nsomehow immunizes them against asthma.\n\n   ``A century ago,'' Dr. Buist said, ``most people walked around\nwith a load of worms or parasites, and the immune system became\npretty good at dealing with them. As hygiene has increased and the\nwater system has improved, we have done away with all that priming\nof the immune system.''\n\n   Scientists know that asthma often develops along a pathway;\nearly in life, the immune system is ``sensitized'' to allergens and\npollutants that trigger asthma attacks. If sensitization never\ntakes place, they reason, asthma might never occur.\n\n   At Columbia University, researchers are trying to determine when\nsensitization happens. They are enrolling 480 pregnant women who\nwill carry air-quality monitors for two days in the third\ntrimester. Their babies' umbilical-cord blood will be analyzed, and\nthe infants will be followed for five years to see who develops\nasthma.\n\n   Until scientists learn more about prevention, doctors and nurses\nare left to teach patients how to manage the disease, through\nproper medication and changes in their environment.\n\n   Two years ago, federal health officials recommended the daily\nuse of inhaled corticosteroids to control asthma in people with\nmoderate or severe disease. But only half the eligible patients use\nthem, said Dr. William Busse, a professor of medicine at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin in Madison who helped write the\nrecommendations.\n\n   One reason, Busse said, is that the idea of asthma as a serious\nchronic disorder that requires daily medical management is\nrelatively new, and many doctors have not yet accepted it.
