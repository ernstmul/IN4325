She built another pen\nearlier in the summer and remodeled a temporary pen. And on\nThursday, a new pen was built to accommodate a bear population that\ncould grow even bigger before fall is in full swing.\n\n   All are orphan cubs who have either lost their mother to the\nhands of hunters or have been abandoned by mothers trying to find\nfood to save their own lives.\n\n   Some have wandered down into towns themselves looking for food.\n\n   Adult bears live under the ``two strikes'' law that says that\nafter a bear is found in civilization and tagged, it must be killed\nthe next time it creates a problem for humans.\n\n   Cubs, however, get three strikes, Limbach said, because they\naren't tagged the first time around.\n\n   ``These guys already have it in their heads to come down low\nbecause that's what mom taught them,'' Limbach said. ``I've just\nreplaced their mother.''\n\n   And like a mother, Limbach will push them out on their own very\nsoon.\n\n   When they arrived, the cubs were well below what they should\nweigh at this time of year.\n\n   One of the cubs, who was rescued earlier this summer near Mack,\nweighed only 37 pounds _ about 60 pounds underweight.\n\n   But that's quickly changing. In Limbach's controlled habitat,\nthe animals get as much food as they can eat so they can build up\nthe fat needed to survive the winter hibernation.\n\n   The bears eat a total of about 500 pounds of food per day and\nare each gaining about 2 pounds of fat a day. When they're not\neating, they're sleeping.\n\n   After a few weeks of seemingly perpetual eating, the cubs have\nbecome little balls of fur and fat.\n\n   ``They don't play this time of year,'' Limbach said.\n``Everything they eat is to build fat and they don't want to waste\nany energy.''\n\n   The bears will continue to fatten up until late November, when\nLimbach will induce hibernation at the shelter. In late February or\nearly March, Limbach and Colorado Division of Wildlife officials\nwill head to the hills to build dens for the bears. The bears will\nthen be driven in by snowmobiles and placed in their new dens.\n\n   ``And when they come out of hibernation in March,'' Limbach\nsaid, ``I'm hopefully just a nightmare for them.''\n\n   Limbach is a savior for the DOW, said John Broderick, a district\nwildlife manager.\n\n   ``She's a real asset to the DOW and yet we don't support her\n(financially) in any way,'' Broderick said. ``She's an excellent\nexample of a rehabilitator.''\n\n   Earlier this summer, when the rehab center had all the bears it\ncould hold, officials still didn't hesitate to call and ask Limbach\nif she had room for just one more, she said.\n\n   The bears at the rehab center have very little interaction with\nhumans, other than when Limbach or her husband, Paul, do the\nfeeding. The public isn't allowed to come and visit the bears like\nthey're at a zoo.\n\n   Broderick said this makes it easier to release the animals into\nthe wild. When they need to be moved within the rehab center, say,\nfrom pen to pen, they're drugged.\n\n   ``They're very wild,'' Broderick said. ``Those bears, in a\nsense, are ready now to be released into the wild. They are not\ntame in any manner.''\n\n   Limbach said she is careful not to become too attached to the\nbears while they're under her care. She enjoys taking care of the\nanimals and believes she's doing her part to get them ready for a\nlong and prosperous life in the Colorado backcountry.\n\n   But sometimes it's hard not to have feelings for them.\n\n   An older bear who Limbach took care of earlier this year was\npromptly shot by a hunter once it returned to the wild, she said.\n\n   Still, Limbach said, she's able to take something positive from\nthe experience.\n\n   ``It's sad; it's depressing,'' she said. ``But maybe it had at\nleast one happy month (here) without too much stress.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   SILT, Colo. _ The small rusty sign, propped against a wood fence\nin the yard, tells you it's the Pauline S.
