For release Sunday, Aug. 8.\n      By JEFF NESMITH\n      c.1999 Cox News Service\n\n   WASHINGTON _ The effect of New York City's decision to close its\nFresh Kills landfill, a 50-year-old, 3,000-acre mound of garbage on\nStaten Island, is spreading through neighboring states like a bad\nsmell.\n\n   Without Fresh Kills, which is scheduled to close Dec. 31, 2001,\nthe only way the city can get rid of the 13,000 tons of residential\ngarbage it generates every day is by shipping it elsewhere.\n\n   As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki search for\nfresh fields for garbage now going to Fresh Kills _ the largest\nactive landfill on Earth _ state officials as far south as North\nCarolina and as far west as Ohio and Indiana wait nervously.\n\n   Fearing convoys of big trucks loaded with what rots and stinks\nfrom New York, state legislatures are passing laws to ban or\nrestrict out-of-state garbage _ and bills have been introduced in\nCongress to overturn a Supreme Court decision declaring such state\nlaws unconstitutional.\n\n   A Senate bill, introduced by a first-term Republican, George\nVoinovich of Ohio, has been assigned to the Environment and Natural\nResources Committee, whose chairman has expressed strong\nreservations about the bill. Voinovich says he still hopes the\npanel will approve the bill.\n\n   Meanwhile, the pending collision between a garbage stream that\ncannot be turned off and an adamant ``not here'' reaction to it is\nforcing new dialogues about the way America looks at waste, and may\nbe providing a preview of future garbage wars.\n\n   Various interests swirl around garbage like the seagulls, crows,\nstarlings and pigeons that hang out at Fresh Kills. They include:\n\n   _ Private garbage haulers and landfill operators, including two\nof the largest companies in the country.\n\n   _ Environmentalists, who think they perceive in the crisis\ncircumstances that could decisively favor one of their movement's\nfondest dreams, recycling.\n\n   _ New York officials like Giuliani, who inherited the problem in\na city that has a history of responding to garbage problems with ad\nhoc solutions.\n\n   _ Neighborhood officials, such as Staten Island Borough\nPresident Guy Molinari, who is adamant that Fresh Kills, which\nopened in 1948 as a ``temporary'' solution to an earlier solid\nwaste crisis, be closed.\n\n   _ Federal environmental officials, equally determined that the\ncity keep its 2001 commitment to close the landfill, which lacks a\nlining to contain liquid runoff.\n\n   _ State officials, such as the Republican governors of New\nJersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, all of whom have engaged in\nangry exchanges with New York's Republican mayor over the issue.\n\n   _ Local officials, such as those in Charles City County, Va.,\nwhich has enjoyed an infusion of revenue in the form of ``host\nfees'' from a 934-acre landfill owned by America's largest trash\nhauler, Waste Management Inc. of Houston.\n\n   Ken Chandler, county administrator of Charles City County, said\nthe modern, federally approved, lined landfill is a welcome\naddition to his county, primarily because of the revenue it\nproduces.\n\n   The landfill is the largest business in the county of 7,000\npeople, Chandler said. Since it opened in 1990, it has provided a\nstream of revenue that allowed the predominantly black county to\nbuild a state-of-the-art school complex, with elementary, middle\nand high schools, while cutting property taxes 44 percent, he said.\n\n   ``The whole concept of where we are today was seen as a very\ngood thing in the '80s,'' Chandler said. ``Regulated landfills were\nactually promoted by the state back then.''\n\n   Much of the garbage that has subsequently come to Charles City\nCounty originated in New York, where Waste Management and other\nhaulers collect a daily load of commercial waste roughly equal to\nthe 13,000 daily tons of residential garbage that goes to Fresh\nKills. The commercial garbage is already trucked out of the city.\n\n   The Charles City County landfill is one of seven ``megafills''\nin Virginia, all of them owned either by Waste Management or the\ncountry's second largest garbage company, the yet unnamed entity\nthat would result from the pending merger of Browning Ferris\nIndustries of Houston and Allied Waste Industries of Scottsdale,\nAriz.\n\n   Anticipating new business from the Fresh Kills closing, Waste\nManagement has received county permission to build special garbage\nbarge docks at Port Tobacco on the James River.\n\n   However, Gov. James Gilmore, who like other state officials\nsupported the waste industry in the early 1990s when the seven\nlarge landfills were built and who has received significant\ncampaign support from the industry, ordered the state attorney\ngeneral to oppose construction of the port in federal court.\n\n   So far, courts have ruled that the state's opposition to the\nport is an effort to ban or restrict the flow of out-of-state\ngarbage. In a 1993 ruling, the Supreme Court declared that garbage\nshipments were protected from state interference by the\nConstitution's interstate commerce clause, which reserves to\nCongress the authority to regulate commerce between states.\n\n   Bills introduced in the House and Senate would delegate this\nauthority to states, as far as garbage is concerned.\n\n   The measures resemble bills that have been introduced in each of\nthe past several years. Ironically, the chief obstacle to passage\nhas been Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce\nCommittee and a close friend and ally of Gilmore.\n\n   ``I think we have a pretty good chance of it this time,''\nVoinovich said. ``The environment has changed significantly.''\n\n   Voinovich said that when he became governor of Ohio eight years\nago, that state was importing around 3.7 million tons of garbage a\nyear, most of it from New Jersey.\n\n   Today, the largest garbage importer is Pennsylvania.\n\n   For collecting and hauling off commercial refuse, New York\nalready pays about $57 a ton, and although contracts for handling\nthe residential waste haven't been signed, most expectations are\nthat the cost will easily exceed $60 a ton.\n\n   Meanwhile, environmentalists say the net cost of recycling\nmaterials like metal, glass and plastic _ a process that brings in\nless revenue than it costs _ is going down in New York. The city\nalready sells more than 130,000 tons of waste paper a year to a\nnewly opened paper recycling mill on Staten Island, and another\npaper plant is planned in the Bronx.\n\n   ``Within the next five years or so, it's likely that despite the\ninevitable start-up costs, recycling and landfilling will be on a\ncost par with one another, and that's not environmental\npoppycock,'' said Eric Goldstein, an attorney in the New York\noffice of the National Resources Defense Council.\n\n   ``The real challenge for the 21st century will not be whose\nlandfills get filled up first, but how to accelerate the shift to\nrecycling, reusing and recovering that will benefit the nation as a\nwhole,'' he said.\n\n   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)\n\n   Goldstein and others think the dilemma closing in on Guiliani\nmay force New York to lead the way in making that shift.\n\n   Whatever the method, Staten Island wants Fresh Kills closed.\n\n   Opened in 1948 as a temporary way to deal with garbage that was\nspilling out of small, waterfront dumps, the landfill became so\nlarge that the Statue of Liberty could be buried upright in it with\n25 feet of garbage on top of her upreaching arm.\n\n   According to Nicholas Dmytryszyn(cq), environmental engineer and\nconsultant to borough president Molinari, by the seventh day of\nevery calendar year the landfill generates enough air pollution to\nbe in violation of the federal Clean Air Act for the rest of the\nyear.\n\n   An enormous flow of methane gas is collected and flared, and\neventually it will be added to natural gas used by New York's gas\nutility, Brooklyn Union Gas, he said.\n\n   Dmytryszyn said he was skeptical about the prospects for\nrecycling to significantly reduce the New York waste stream.\n\n   ``There are great differences between our understanding of\nreality and that of the environmental groups,'' he said. ``They\ntend to take the position that if you recycle, businesses will come\nin and set up technologies to use the materials.''\n\n   However, it is done, he said, Staten Island wants Fresh Kills\nclosed.\n\n   ``This landfill has been operating too long illegally and we\nwant it shut down,'' he said. ``It is a quality-of-life debacle on\nthis island.''\n\n   Paul Young, an assistant New York santitation commissioner, said\nthe city will close Fresh Kills on time, and that will mean\nexporting thousands of tons of garbage a day.\n\n   ``The New York City Department of Sanitation, before entering\ninto a contract to export garbage, checks that our garbage is\ndelivered to a licensed and permitted facility that also has a host\ncommunity agreement,'' she said. ``That's wherever our garbage\ngoes.
