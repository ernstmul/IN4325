Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ The police on Sunday arrested the 17th man suspected\nof participating in attacks against women in Central Park after the\nNational Puerto Rican Day Parade June 11.\n\n   The suspect, Lonnie Hopson, was arrested at his home in Queens\nabout 1 a.m. Sunday. He was charged with one count of first-degree\nsexual abuse, a felony, and one count of first-degree riot. He's\nbeing held pending arraignment.\n\n   Detective George Nagy, a police spokesman, said Hopson was\nrecorded on amateur videotape among the frenzied crush of men who\nabused dozens of women in the southeastern corner of the park on\nJune 11. He was arrested without incident, the police said.\n\n   Like almost all of those arrested so far, police said, Hopson,\n18, does not have a criminal record.\n\n   The police said detectives were led to Hopson by an anonymous\ncaller who saw his picture published in newspapers and broadcast on\ntelevision. The figure in the picture was distinctive. In it, the\nsuspect wears a football jersey bearing the number 20 and a thick\ngold chain and has his hair braided in wide cornrows.\n\n   The authorities would not say what role they believed Hopson\nplayed in the attacks, saying that more details would emerge when\nhe was arraigned.\n\n   The police have released photographs of 20 other men wanted for\ntheir roles in the attack.\n\n   In successive news conferences Sunday, members of 100 Blacks in\nLaw Enforcement Who Care, the Rev. Al Sharpton and the National\nOrganization for Women appeared near the intersection of Central\nPark South and the Avenue of the Americas, where the attacks\noccurred.\n\n   Sharpton arrived with two women, Ashanna Cover and Josina\nLawrence, who have filed lawsuits against the city. They stood by\nthe street lamp where the two women say they were attacked.\n\n   ``These women have returned to the scene of the crime,''\nSharpton said. ``Today is Father's Day. We will hope that all\nfathers take a stand against this reckless, misogynist behavior and\ndo what is necessary to restore a sense of security and respect to\nour daughters in the city.''\n\n   Sharpton also said he would lead all-male rallies starting next\nSaturday, beginning with a rally in Harlem and then moving on from\nborough to borough. ``We need to really deal with the fact that\nsome young men feel it is appropriate and even fun to do what\nhappened in the park last weekend,'' he said.\n\n   Two hours later, roughly 200 demonstrators arrived at the\nintersection and began a march to the Central Park precinct of the\nNew York Police to protest the department's handling of the\nattacks.\n","Headline":"\n17TH MAN ARRESTED IN CENTRAL PARK SEX ATTACKS\n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ The police on Sunday arrested the 17th man suspected\nof participating in attacks against women in Central Park after the\nNational Puerto Rican Day Parade June 11.\n","\n   The suspect, Lonnie Hopson, was arrested at his home in Queens\nabout 1 a.m. Sunday.
