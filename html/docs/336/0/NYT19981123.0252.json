He can't stand that. Even worse,\nthose who leave the car running while they dash into a store.\nBlasphemous!\n\n   Then there are those who buy impulsively, filling their closets\nwith clutter that will someday end up in a landfill.\n\n   And one more thing: ``Bottled water drives me crazy,''\nLilienfeld said. ``There are very few places in the United States\nwhere any official would advise you to drink bottled water over tap\nwater.''\n\n   It's not the mad attempt at status-grabbing that bothers him so\nmuch. It's the utterly unnecessary wasting of natural resources\nthat sends him into a tizzy.\n\n   ``Many people just don't understand,'' Lilienfeld said. ``If\neach of us would do a little bit, it would make an enormous\ndifference.''\n\n   And this time of year, Lilienfeld feels as frantic about his\nmessage as last-minute Christmas shoppers.\n\n   Americans throw away 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving\nand New Year's than any other time of the year, according to the\nULS Report.\n\n   Sales fliers. Catalogs. Shopping bags. Greeting cards. Gift\nwrapping. Ribbons. Decorations. Leftover food from holiday fetes.\nCombined, it makes the nation's trash grow by an extra 1 million\ntons per week.\n\n   It's pure madness. It's enough to set a man on a mission to get\nAmericans to conserve.\n\n   Lilienfeld, an environmental activist who hails from Michigan,\nand William Rathje, an Arizona anthropologist who studies garbage,\nare the authors of ``Use Less Stuff: Environmental Solutions for\nWho We Really Are'' (Ballantine Publishing Group; $12). The newly\nreleased book grew out of their nonprofit bimonthly newsletter\ncalled the ULS (Use Less Stuff) Report, which for five years has\noffered strategies for reducing consumption and conserving\nresources while saving money.\n\n   Their message is spreading, hitting home with at least 20,000\nsubscribers, including Mosa and Nancy Kaleel of Sherman Oaks.\n\n   Two years ago, the Kaleels were among the many guilty of being\ngenerous contributors to the American waste stream. It wasn't until\nthey started recycling paper, plastic and glass that the couple\ntook a good look at their garbage for the first time and noticed\nthey were throwing away enormous amounts of food.\n\n   That's when they started planning their menus rather than\nhaphazardly throwing items in a shopping cart and wondering why the\nbroccoli always went bad.\n\n   Mosa held onto his '87 car, uses both sides of the paper at work\nand takes his own cup to Starbucks. Nancy donates old magazines to\nnursing homes and makes gifts for friends from furniture she finds\nat garage sales. She decorates chairs with old keys or bottle caps\nand weaves new seats from twine.\n\n   They took their name off of catalog mailing lists to reduce\ntheir junk mail. ``I definitely wanted to get away from being the\nultimate consumer,'' said Mosa, 30. ``We've let ourselves become\nunconscious about our surroundings and our waste. We need to take\nresponsibility for the affluence of our society.''\n\n   A state law passed in 1989 required every California city to\nreduce the amount of waste dumped into landfills by 25 percent by\n1995 and 50 percent by 2000. It's spurred municipalities to\ninstitute recycling programs; even Christmas trees get turned into\nmulch now.\n\n   But that's not the entire answer, Lilienfeld said.\n\n   To really reduce our waste, we have to reduce consumption in the\nfirst place, he said.\n\n   ``We're doing it backwards,'' Lilienfeld said. ``We're patting\nourselves on the back for collecting as much waste as possible but\nin reality what we wanted to do was not create it in the first\nplace. By worrying about packaging, we keep hiding the fact that we\nare using too much stuff.''\n\n   What is the main culprit filling up the landfills? Of the 210\nmillion tons of trash Americans dispose of yearly, paper makes up\nthe bulk of it _ about 38 percent. That's followed by yard waste\n(13 percent), food (10 percent) and plastics (9 percent), according\nto the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n   Still, there are signs Americans are starting to catch on to the\nurgings of environmentalists, said Bob Dellinger, the EPA's\ndirector of municipal and industrial solid waste.\n\n   In 1960, Americans generated an average of 2.68 pounds of\ngarbage per person each day. That number continued to climb,\nhitting a high of 4.5 pounds a day per person in 1990.\n\n   Then in 1996, the number dipped slightly to 4.3 pounds a day,\nthe most recent statistic available.\n\n   Dellinger attributed the shift to two major factors: Consumers\nare making small changes, such as leaving grass clippings on their\nlawn and composting, and corporations, in an attempt to lower\nshipping costs, are using less material to package products.\n\n   Reduce, reuse, recycle _ that's the mantra uttered by\nconservationists everywhere. Not only will you help save the earth,\nyou stand to save money.\n\n   To help you get started, conservationists offered these tips:\n\n   DECKING THE HALLS: Buy outdoor light strands that are wired in\nparallel so that if one bulb blows out, the rest will keep shining.\nThe smaller the bulb, the lower the wattage and the lower the\nenergy use.\n\n   Instead of Christmas cards, consider sending an e-mail greeting.\nThere are dozens of Web sites that offer free, animated postcards\nyou can personalize and send via e-mail.

Not only is this practicing the second\nconservationist tenet _ reuse _ you'll save money, too.\n\n   Turn down the heat before guests arrive. You'll save energy, and\nthe extra body heat of the guests will warm up the room.\n\n   Plan meals wisely and practice portion control to minimize\nwaste. If you have leftovers, don't throw them away. Send food home\nwith guests, or donate it to a food bank or church.\n\n   SHOPPING: Consolidate purchases into one bag rather than getting\na new bag at each store. Better yet, bring your own bags.\n\n   Buy rechargeable batteries for electronic toys.\n\n   Donate unwanted gifts or toys the kids have outgrown to charity.\n\n   Drop off extra packing peanuts at mailing stores.

Rather than just piling up\npresents under the tree, think about what your family and friends\nreally want. Give a ticket to a concert, museum or sporting event.\nSign them up for dancing, golf or foreign-language lessons.\n\n   MAKE YOUR OWN GIFTS: Homemade gifts have added meaning.\n\n   Kreigh Hampel, a Burbank artist whose projects are made from\nrecycled materials, scours junkyards to find materials for gifts he\nmakes _ frames decorated with braided vines along the borders, or\nfurniture he's refinished and refashioned from discarded scraps.\n\n   ``Junkyards create a huge palette of materials,'' he said.\n\n   You don't have to be an artist to make a great gift.
