A sneeze or cough isn't just something she can\nbrush aside and ignore. It's something she builds upon and becomes\nobsessed with.\n\n   ``I could go from this one little pain to the funeral,'' Liz\nsaid, who asked that her last name not be used. ``The worrier part\nof you escalates all these feelings that cause your anxiety\nlevel.''\n\n   UCLA psychologist Michelle Craske characterizes hypersensitivity\nas a fear of one's own body _ a prevalent theory in panic disorder\nresearch. A person can feel a twinge, Craske said, and think\ncancer.\n\n   True panic sufferers often become convinced that they're going\ncrazy or that they're about to die. Attacks happen often, usually\nwithout warning, and typically peak within 10 minutes.\nNevertheless, for panic sufferers it's 10 minutes of terror. It's\nthe fact that you can't predict it that differentiates panic\nattacks from stage fright or other anxieties.\n\n   Researchers say the condition is probably genetic, passed\ndirectly from parent to child, and may be the result of a chemical\nimbalance.\n\n   ``It's not some imaginary thing that people talk themselves\ninto. It's a pathological disorder,'' said Dr. John Murphy, a\nBeverly Hills psychiatrist who, with his partner Dennis Munjack,\nconducts clinical trials in which panic sufferers experiment with\nnew medications.\n\n   ``As best we understand it, it's a chemical imbalance. But we\ndon't know if it's in the brain, the blood stream or the\nrespiratory tract.''\n\n   After living with and studying her condition for seven years,\nLiz knows all the theories and medical terminology. She recognizes\na panic attack when one is in progress. Still it can feel like ants\nare crawling up her face.\n\n   ``My son had (the condition), and that really made me sad,'' she\nsaid. ``This is something you don't want to be passing on. This\naffects my husband, my children. It's scary.''\n\n   According to Pasadena psychiatrist and neurologist Dr. Stuart\nShipko, 1 out of 75 people worldwide suffers from panic disorder.\nSufferers are 12 times more likely to go to hospital emergency\nrooms and visit doctors 700 percent more than the general\npopulation.\n\n   In 1999, panic even became pop-culturally trendy. We watched\nfictional mob bosses played by Robert De Niro (in the film\n``Analyze This'') and James Gandolfini (star of the HBO series\n``The Sopranos'') visit analysts for treatment of panic attacks.\nCelebrities like actress Kim Basinger and talk-show-host/singer\nDonny Osmond admitted they suffered from panic and anxiety\ndisorders.\n\n   Shipko, who runs the Panic Disorders Institute and Web site,\nsaid the condition is hardly a new phenomenon. He doesn't believe\ndoctors have treatment under control.\n\n   ``The amount of real help for panic disorder in this country in\nno way meets the demand for it,'' said Shipko. ``Personally, as a\nclinician, I've been able to move really fast because of\ninformation forwarded to me over the Internet. I've also seen a\ncouple of thousand people with panic disorder, and I've begun to\ndraw my own conclusions.''\n\n   Shipko's Web site includes his theories on the link between\npanic, bile flow and gastroesophageal reflux. He has also written\nabout extreme fluctuation in the heart rates of panic patients over\na 24-hour period.\n\n   The site also includes a bulletin board where panic sufferers\ncan ask questions and exchange information. Shipko, who answers\nmany of the questions personally, said he has learned much from his\n``citizen scientists.''\n\n   ``I lead a group of grass-roots patients who were smarter than\ntheir doctors,'' he said.\n\n   Self-education helped Lori, who now helps operate Shipko's Panic\nDisorders Institute Web site from her home in Laramie, Wyo. A panic\nsufferer since childhood, Lori underwent years of therapy. When her\nyoungest son started to show symptoms of the condition, Lori began\nconducting research. Now she's a health educator who is working on\na book about anxiety disorders in children.\n\n   ``Between the two of us, we give out a lot of information,''\nLori said. ``Our site isn't meant to take the place of a doctor,\nbut it can help you understand what questions to ask your doctor.\nWe reach a lot of people.''\n\n   To keep her panic under control, Liz _ who is Murphy's patient _\nuses a combination of diversionary techniques and medication. But\nthose two approaches to panic disorder treatment _ biological and\ncognitive behavioral therapy _ don't always coincide.\n\n   Patients who visit Craske at UCLA's Anxiety Disorders Behavioral\nProgram, for example, will learn all about anxiety. During the 12\nto 16 sessions in the program, patients learn to gain control of\ntheir breathing and are made to confront the symptoms they\nexperience when suffering a panic attack. Agoraphobics are exposed\nto the situations they fear _ elevators, driving or being alone _\nso they learn to be less afraid. Drugs aren't part of the program,\nalthough Craske might prescribe medication in her clinical\npractice.\n\n   Shipko said that by the time they contact the Panic Disorders\nInstitute, Shipko's patients are looking for a concrete medical\ndiagnosis _ conclusive proof that they're not crazy. And they want\nthe panic attacks stopped immediately, even if means starting on\nmedication.\n\n   ``Stopping the attacks is critical,'' Shipko said. ``If you stop\nthe attacks, a large portion of the people will have no phobias or\ndepression, and they're largely able to go on with their lives as\nnormal.''\n\n   Doctors often prescribe anti-depressants, benzodiazepines (such\nas Klonopin and Xanax) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)\nsuch as phenalzine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\nsuch as Zoloft and Paxil are also now used to treat panic. All of\nthe medications have associated risks and side effects and are\npotentially addictive.\n\n   Although he believes the basic panic attack cannot be stopped by\nany means except through medication, Shipko said drugs are not\nnecessarily required for treatment of other related symptoms.\n\n   ``It's not all black and white, that either you can control this\nand pull yourself up by your bootstraps or that this is a\nneurological disease that must be medicated,'' Shipko said. ``It's\nnot either/or, it's both.''\n","Headline":"\nIT'S NOT SO EASY TO SAY `DON'T PANIC'\n","Text":["\n   ``Panic'' _ the word sounds like what actually happens: an\naccelerated heart beat, sweating, shortness of breath.\n","\n   For someone with panic disorder, an attack is worse than\nanything we can dream up because it's precisely that person's\nimagination that goes haywire.\n","\n   When she has an attack, Liz, a former executive secretary who\nlives in Diamond Bar, said she develops a feeling of hyper\nself-awareness.
