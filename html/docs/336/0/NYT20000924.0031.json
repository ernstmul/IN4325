Skinned, the corpse of a bear is very much like that of a\nhuman.''\n\n   The apparent kinship between humans and ursines begins early,\nsaid Tom Beck, the top bear researcher with the Colorado Division\nof Wildlife.\n\n   Bear cubs are all curiosity and rambunctiousness, much like\nhuman youngsters, said Beck.\n\n   Even though they age, bears seem never to grow up, say Shepard\nand Sanders, summing up the similarity among mammals with the\ndescription of the bear as ``a taciturn, churlish, hirsute little\nkid weighing 200 pounds.''\n\n   Physically, bears and humans are omnivores with digestive\nsystems that are similar, Beck said. They have digital dexterity\nrivaling that of humans, yet with far greater strength, wrote\nShepard and Sanders.\n\n   Bears are known for their preference of solitude, but they\naren't without social skills, Beck said.\n\n   In fact, they transmit and process information at a high rate,\nparticularly with their noses, Beck said. Humans, said Shepard and\nSanders, might not understand the process but they envy it.\n\n   ``Yet it is clear from the path he takes, the adjustments in his\nbehavior and demeanor and the assertiveness of his feeding that he\nis aware of every bear around him,'' the pair wrote in ``The Sacred\nPaw.'' ``This combination of overall awareness and seeming\nnonchalance is among the bear's most manlike capacities: a\ntaciturn, calculating mixture of knowing and blase sophistication\nthat can be unnerving to human observers.''\n\n   The bonds between bear and man are social as well as\ninstinctive, said Dr. Bob Sammons, a Grand Junction psychiatrist.\n\n   ``All of us grew up with the Teddy Bear,'' said Sammons. Boys\nhad no dolls, but they had stuffed bears.\n\n   The aura of innocence surrounding bears is reinforced by the\nfact that so many people today know so little about them, Sammons\nsaid.\n\n   ``Our society has been protected from bears,'' he said. ``We\nhave not had to fear them.''\n\n   Smokey Bear and cartoon characters such as Yogi go even farther\nto reinforce the early associations with bears as creatures of\ninnocence, comfort, even camaraderie, he said.\n\n   Bears pose a morbid fascination for humans, as well, said Beck.\n\n   Not only can they kill humans, they also will eat them, a most\ndisturbing notion for the top of the food chain.\n\n   And bears, what do they see when looking back at their fellow\nomnivores?\n\n   Beck's best guess: ``Maybe a funny-looking bear.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Humans and bears look at one another,\nand in some ways see themselves looking back.\n","\n   ``Watching them explore their environments, we recognize a\nconsciousness somewhat like our own,'' wrote Paul Shepard and Barry\nSanders in ``The Sacred Paw: The bear in nature, myth and\nliterature.'' ``We have the uncanny feeling that beneath the fur is\na man.
