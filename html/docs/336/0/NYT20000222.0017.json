Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ To a chorus of boos, shouts and cheers at the Apollo\nTheater in Harlem, Bill Bradley and Al Gore engaged on Monday night\nin the most brutal presidential debate of the year, with Bradley\nattacking the vice president as a ``conservative Democrat'' and\nGore caustically describing Bradley as a ``desperate'' candidate\nintent on tearing down his fellow Democrat.\n\n   The two men drew their swords almost as soon as the session\nbegan, and from there on in, turned almost every question into an\nattack on their opponent. It was politics as spectacle, produced in\nan 87-year-old theater that is better known for the music of\nCharlie Parker and James Brown than debates between men seeking to\nbe president.\n\n   ``What you've seen is an elaborate, what I call Gore-dance,''\nBradley said in talking about the two men's positions on\nregistering handgun control. ``It's a dance to avoid facing up to\nyour conservative record on guns.''\n\n   ``Senator Bradley,'' Gore responded, ``a couple of days ago,\nyour campaign said that you wanted to get some things off your\nchest. Well, since then you've made personal attack after personal\nattack. The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They\ndo divide us as Democrats.''\n\n   He added: ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're\ntrying to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down.''\n\n   Bradley, speaking to a mostly black audience, repeatedly\nattacked Gore for voting in 1981 in Congress to overturn an\nInternal Revenue Service ruling that would forbid tax exemptions to\nprivate colleges with racially discriminatory practices, saying\nthat it would help schools like Bob Jones University in South\nCarolina.\n\n   Early in the debate, Bradley produced a sheaf of papers, which\nhe said included a stack of the bills Gore had supported, and tried\nto thrust them into Gore's hand.\n\n   The gesture was reminiscent of what Gore had attempted to do to\nat an earlier debate, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' when he\nchallenged Bradley to agree to foreswear any more 30-second\ntelevised advertisements. Bradley ignored Gore's hand that Sunday\nmorning, and Gore returned the gesture on Monday night.\n\n   Gore noted that the bill Bradley referred to dealt with quotas\nand that it had been approved by an overwhelming majority in\nCongress, with the votes of most Democrats, and, describing the\nassertion that Bob Jones University would have benefited as a\n``phony and scurrilous charge.''\n\n   And trying to turn the tables on Bradley on another issue of\nconcern to this audience, Gore questioned why Bradley had voted\nagainst expanding the number of broacast franchises available to\nminorities.\n\n   The exchange was emblematic of a debate, sponsored by Time and\nCNN, that repeatedly seemed on the verge of running out of control,\nboth because of the candidates on stage and a particularly rowdy\naudience that offered the candidates a memorable image of New York\npolitics at its most insolent.\n\n   ``Time, time, time,'' the moderator, Bernard Shaw, said\nrepeatedly as Gore, in particular, attempted to ride past the\ndeadlines, responding to Bradley, who was by far more animated than\nhe has ever been before.\n\n   ``Look, Mr. _ Mr. Moderator, and as a point of personal\nprivilege, can I respond to that?'' Gore asked.\n\n   ``According to the rules the rules agreed to by both your\nstaffs, you cannot, sir,'' Shaw responded, to a swell of laughs\nfrom the 1,500-seat hall.\n\n   When the candidates were not creating tulmult, the audience\npitched in. When Gore was asked a question about the environment, a\nmember of the audience bellowed; ``Vice President Gore, if you\nsupport environmental justice what are you doing about the fact\nthat $500,000 of your money . . . .'' He was drowned out by loud\nyells from the audience, leaving the candidates standing in awkward\nsilence.\n\n   By any measure, this was the toughest presidential debate\ninvolving Republicans or Democrats this year. Again and again,\nBradley attacked Gore as a conservative Democrat, suggesting that\nhe was submerging conservative views on affirmative action,\nabortion and gun control as he sought to win the Democratic\nprimary.\n\n   ``He was a conservative Democratic,'' Bradley said. ``Did not\nsupport national health insurance, had an 84 percent right to life\nvoting record and was the poster boy for the NRA.\n\n   nn\n\n   Gore responded by portraying Bradley as desperate and\nuntrustworthy, asserting that his health care program endangered\nthe elderly and AIDS patients.\n\n   But Bradley said no one would suffer under his plan. ``Tonight I\npledge that any health care bill that I would sign would have every\nMedicaid patient a better health plan than Medicaid is today. . .\n.''\n\n   ``Well, that's not a plan, that's a magic wand.'' Gore said.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   At times, it seemed unlikely that anyone in the audience _ or\nwatching on television _ could follow the details of the charges\nthat Gore and Bradley threw at each other. At one point, Bradley\nreferred, rather obliquely, to a page in the book ``All Too\nHuman,'' by George Stephanopoulus, Clinton's former senior aide, to\nassert that Gore had worked in the administration to undermine\naffirmative action. Gore repeatedly affirmed his commitment to the\nprogram last night.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The debate was the first in a month, and came at a particularly\ncritical time for Bradley, whose campaign nationally _ and in New\nYork, a state where he had once been seen as posing a powerful\nchallenge to Gore _ has seemed increasingly adrift.\n\n   Bradley's supporters viewed Monday night's session as a chance,\narguably one of his last before New York and several other crucial\nstates hold primaries on March 7, to effectively put his campaign\nback on the map.\n\n   It was the second time that Gore and Bradley has appeared at a\ndebate devoted to black issues. The audience on Monday night was\nalmost entirely black, invited by community and chuch\norganizations. And the first question was posed by the Rev. Al\nSharpton, who, with the Rev. Floyd Flake, suggested two weeks ago\nthat the two Democratic candidates for president holding a debate\non racial issues in a black community.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Gore and Bradley agreed on a few things. They both denounced the\nflying of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina, drawing a\ndistinction from either one of the Republicans whom they might face\nin November. Both Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain\nof Arizona have declined to condemn South Carolina for flying the\nflag.\n\n   They also joined, in response to a question from Sharpton, in\ndecrying the Amadou Diallo shooting case, describing it as evidence\nof racial insensitivy in police departments. Both candidates said\nthey would issue executive orders to ban so-called racial\nprofiling, in which police departments use race as a factor in\nevaluating the potential risk of a candidate.\n\n   ``But I also think it reflects racial profiling in the sense of\nracial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he\nsees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet\nin the hand of a black man as a gun,'' Bradley said.\n\n   Bradley repeated his earlier exhortations of why Gore did not\nsimply stroll down the hall to ask President Clinton to issue an\nexecutive order, immediately, banning racial profiling. Gore said\nwork had indeed begun to move in that direction. But he issued the\nfirst of numerous one-line attacks: ``You know, racial profiling\npractically began in New Jersey, senator.''\n\n   That set the tone the next few minutes, on issues ranging from\npossible reparations for slavery, to health care, to technology and\neducation for African-Americans. Several times, Gore criticized\nBradley for failing to support legislation that would have expanded\nthe number of African-American and minority-owned broadcasting\noutlets.\n\n   Bradley said on Monday night that he would support Gore if he\nbecome, as many Democrats now believe is likely, his party's\nnominee.
