Times News Service    \n\n   Throughout his tempestuous career, Bryan Cox has often talked\nabout how he has to play football on the ``edge,'' about how he\n``can't lose that edge.'' But now he has toppled over that edge,\nagain.\n\n   When the New York Jets, after losing the injured linebacker\nMarvin Jones last summer, suddenly signed Cox, coach Bill Parcells\ndid not try to put him on trial or on probation for having\nsometimes created chaos with the Miami Dolphins and the Chicago\nBears in other years.\n\n   ``Just be Bryan Cox,'' Parcells told him.\n\n   But just being Bryan Cox is like being a time bomb, a danger to\nothers and to himself. Although he had been on his best behavior\nsince joining the Jets, anyone familiar with his past could hear\nthis 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound time bomb ticking. And the bomb\nfinally exploded, in a relatively quiet locker room eruption.\n\n   Upon learning of his $10,000 fine for unnecessary roughness in\nclubbing (without a penalty) both quarterback Steve McNair and\nrunning back Eddie George last Sunday in Tennessee, the 30-year-old\nCox, who is black, calmly accused the National Football League of\nracism in its hierarchy.\n\n   ``Although I'm unhappy about the fine, I will take the fine,''\nhe said. ``I don't want to be a person that's going to cause some\nconflict in this locker room. I'm trying to do the best that I can.\nWe're in the middle of trying to make the best playoff run we can\nmake.''\n\n   For six consecutive seasons, Cox has had at least one incendiary\nincident and nine over all at a total cost of $146,000 in fines,\nbelieved to be an NFL career record.\n\n   Now that the time bomb has exploded again, even calmly, is that\nall there is? Will he revert just to being a solid linebacker\nhelping in the Jets' quest for the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs?\n\n   Or will Cox resume going tick, tick, tick, especially on Dec.\n13, when the Jets are in Miami, where his split personality wore\nout his welcome, and again on Dec. 19 when the Jets are in Buffalo,\nwhere he feuded with and spit at Bills rooters while with the\nDolphins?\n\n   He hasn't been in Buffalo since a 1995 playoff game (which the\nDolphins lost), when his running feud with the Bills' fans prompted\nthe presence of more than two dozen county police in riot helmets\nbehind the Dolphins' bench and both end zones in Rich Stadium.\n\n   ``My intent is not to injure anybody,'' Cox said on Wednesday,\n``just to cause as much pain and hurt as I can.''\n\n   Causing pain and hurt is the mantra of every linebacker, but few\nacknowledge it as bluntly as Cox does.\n\n   ``I don't have a three-piece suit and tie, and I'm not going to\nthe stock market exchange,'' he has said. ``I hit people and hurt\npeople for a living. I try to cause as much pain to somebody as I\ncan.''\n\n   He also acknowledges his split personality.\n\n   ``It's like I'm a schizophrenic,'' he has said. ``Some days I\ncould have a chip on my shoulder for no reason and it doesn't take\na lot to set me off. Other days I'm happy and excited and eager\nabout life.''\n\n   Cox has a long NFL rap sheet of fines:\n\n   One game's pay ($87,500 at the time) for an obscene gesture at a\ngame official while with the Bears in 1996; $5,000, $10,000 and\n$15,000 for fighting; $5,000 for spitting at fans; $3,000 for an\nobscene gesture at fans (reduced from $10,000 after the NFL agreed\nto ``maintain a work environment free from racial harassment'' in\nBuffalo); $5,000 for public criticism of game officials; $3,000 and\nnow $10,000 for unnecessary roughness.\n\n   When not wearing his football helmet, Cox, who has a wife and\nthree children, has a reputation as a teddy-bear family man who has\ncontributed his time and money to rebuilding a church in his East\nSt. Louis, Ill., hometown, to his high school there and to a\nfitness center at his college, Western Illinois. In repose, he is\nconsidered a good guy, bright and articulate. But he is a good guy\nwho has bad moments, all of them as an almost lethal linebacker.\n\n   ``I don't care what people think,'' he has said. ``I do my job\nthe best I can, and I do what I think is right.''\n\n   In accusing the NFL of racism, Cox cited the absence of any\nAfrican-American club owners, the presence of only three black head\ncoaches, and the difficulty that black assistant coaches have in\nattaining head coaching status or even being interviewed to fill a\nhead coaching vacancy _ each a valid argument.\n\n   But in branding Gene Washington, the NFL dean of discipline who\nwas once a star 49ers wide receiver, and Harold Henderson, its\nlabor relations director, as token black executives pitted against\nthe players, 70 percent of whom are black, Cox missed the tackle.\n\n   If those jobs in the league office were being done by white\nexecutives, Cox would have a much better case. Instead, he is\narguing racism both ways _ the absence of any black NFL club owners\nas well as the presence of two black league executives in important\ndecision-making positions.\n\n   As for his latest $10,000 fine, the Jets linebacker contended\nthat ``if it was another player, I don't think that person would've\nbeen fined.''
