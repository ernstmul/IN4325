He is accused in the killings\nof two Quebec prison guards _ hits apparently ordered to teach a\nlesson after correction officials showed disrespect for Angels in\ncustody.\n\n   It is a big case for the hard-pressed forces of the law in a\nprovince where mayhem and massacre have become commonplace, thanks\nto Boucher and his savage breed.\n\n   But even with the Angels' bossman behind bars, car bombs are\nstill exploding across the province with appalling frequency, and\nhardly a week passes without a midnight ambush outside some\nbiker-controlled strip joint or tawdry roadhouse.\n\n   The war pitting Quebec's Hells Angels against a hodgepodge of\nrival biker gangs, backed by the province's more traditional\norganized crime groups, is roaring toward its fifth year, with the\ndeath tally growing and no end in sight. At stake is the Quebec\ndrug trade as well as prostitution, smuggling, auto theft,\nextortion and other rackets worth tens of millions of dollars\nannually.\n\n   ``The war is about turf, profits and market share _ not some\nabstract biker honor,'' said Corporal Jacques Lemieux, a Royal\nCanadian Mounted Police investigator assigned to the Criminal\nIntelligence Service of Canada. ``So that makes it deadly\nserious.''\n\n   The Quebec war is considered the bloodiest in the 50-year\nhistory of the world's most infamous biker bunch. At least 93 are\ndead so far, with scores more maimed or seriously wounded; mostly\nbikers and their thuggish comrades, but also civilians cut down in\nthe crossfire. So extraordinary has the level of violence become\nthat even the Economist, a serious British news magazine little\ngiven to sensationalism, recently ran a lengthy examination of the\nHells Angels' audacious grab for criminal power in Canada.\n\n   During the past two weeks alone, three bikers have been cut down\nin a fierce spiral of retaliation between the Angels and their\ncriminal competitors. One shot dead in the gritty city of Laval,\nthe riddled body of another found in his Montreal apartment, the\ncharred corpse of a third pulled from a black Jeep Cherokee _\ntrademark transport of the gang in a province whose long winters\ndiscourage roaring about on Harley-Davidsons _ after the vehicle\nexploded on a road north of Quebec City.\n\n   Elaborate gang funerals have become routine in Montreal, with\nbikers arriving in menacing regalia to mourn their fallen chums\nwhile police surveillance teams and news photographers snap away\nbehind long lenses.\n\n   The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was incorporated in California\nin 1948 by restless World War II veterans bound by a passion for\nriding Harleys and raising Cain. For decades, they were little more\nthan underwashed, beer-swilling rowdies, dangerous only to those\nfoolish enough to sass them in saloons.\n\n   Today, however, the Angels rank among the world's most ruthless\norganized crime syndicates, with 125 chapters in 22 countries in\nNorth and South America, Europe and the Pacific. That figure\nincludes the Nomads, an elite corps of Angels, but not the hundreds\nof lesser biker gangs that operate under the direct control of the\nHells.\n\n   One sign of the times: The Angels boast their own Internet\nWebsite. They hawk T-shirts by electronic order and warn that both\ntheir name _ with its eccentric, apostrophe-less spelling _ and\ntheir death's head symbol are copyrighted corporate logos.\n\n   Although long entrenched in British Columbia, the Hells didn't\nmove into Quebec until 1977, when they took over a homegrown gang,\nthe Popeyes. Today, the French-speaking riders of the province's\nchapters are considered the most murderous members of the\nnotoriously violence-prone fraternity.\n\n   ``They tend to make spectacular hits intended to horrify, not\njust intimidate or coerce. They sometimes act more like terrorists\nthan ordinary criminals,'' said Jean-Paul Brodeur, a criminologist\nwith the University of Montreal's International Center for\nComparative Criminology. ``They are organized to deliver full-scale\nwar.''\n\n   It was in 1994 that the Hells Angels moved to take over Quebec's\nillegal drug trade. But they were met with surprisingly fierce\nresistance from a Montreal-based biker band called the Rock\nMachine, which police describe as essentially a front group for the\nprovince's more traditional crime families.\n\n   ``No one expected the Rock Machine to last this long against a\ngroup so big, powerful and internationally connected,'' said\nLemieux. ``Now the Hells are stepping up the war. They want to\nbring it to an end.''\n\n   In recent weeks, two top leaders of the Rock Machine have been\ngunned down in ambushes, a marked change from earlier tactics in\nwhich the foot soldiers of both sides were targeted, but rarely the\ngenerals.\n\n   ``For a long time they were going after the knees,'' said RCMP\nStaff Sergeant J.P. Levesque, an organized crime specialist. ``Now\nthey are going for the head.''\n\n   Meanwhile, several bomb blasts in September narrowly missed\nHells Angels, ripping apart vehicles and raising the fear level on\nthe streets of Montreal.\n\n   Police efforts to bring the battling factions under control have\nbeen largely thwarted, although the arrest of Boucher following the\nkillings of the two prison guards was an important coup. But last\nJuly, in a major setback to law enforcement, five Angels associates\nwere acquitted of murdering a Rock Machine rival, apparently\nbecause jurors were unconvinced that the killing of gangsters by\nother gangsters represented a social wrong.\n\n   According to Quebec news reports, the Rock Machine may be\nnegotiating an alliance with the Texas-based Bandidos, archrivals\nof the Hells Angels and the only other biker gang with an\ninternational reach.\n\n   The last blowout between the Bandidos and Angels was fought in\nScandinavia with assault rifles and grenade launchers. It ended in\na truce several weeks ago after a dozen or so deaths, making it a\nmere skirmish compared to the Quebec carnage.\n\n   Elsewhere in Canada, the Hells Angels are growing fast, adding\nnew chapters in Alberta and Saskatchewan in recent months.\nAccording to police, the gang is a major crime presence in every\nprovince except Ontario and tiny Prince Edward Island _ and is well\non its way toward controlling serious drug trafficking across the\nnation.\n\n   In British Columbia and Nova Scotia, for instance, the Hells\nAngels control not only distribution of heroin, cocaine and\nhydroponically grown marijuana, but also, through waterfront\nunions, the ports at which smuggled drugs enter.\n\n   ``They are using this particular province and this particular\nsea coast as a platform to the world,'' Halifax's police chief,\nVincent MacDonald, recently told reporters. ``They are involved in\ninternational organized crime.''\n\n   If Quebec falls, the Hells Angels are almost certain to turn\ntheir attention to Ontario, Canada's most populous province and the\nonly important territory in Canada they have failed to penetrate.\n\n   Police say that entry into Ontario might result in another\nbloody war, since at least 13 rival biker gangs are already active\nin that province, and other organized crime groups such as the\nMafia and Asian triads are unlikely to accommodate them.\n\n   But if the Hells Angels emerge as the undisputed winners in the\nQuebec war, potential enemies in Ontario might be frightened into\ncutting them a big piece of the action without a battle.\n\n   ``The Hells have never lost a war, and can't afford to lose this\none,'' said anthropologist Daniel Wolf, who once rode with an\nAlberta affiliate of the Angels. ``A big part of their power stems\nfrom their image as the bikers that never back down.''\n","Headline":"\nHELLS ANGELS ROAR AT CENTER OF VIOLENT QUEBEC DRUG WAR \n","Text":["\n   MONTREAL _ As the body count continues to rise in Quebec's\nvicious biker war, one of its generals _ a Hells Angel honcho known\nas ``Mom'' _ went to trial this week amid some of the heaviest\nsecurity ever seen in a Canadian courtroom.\n","\n   ``Mom'' is the nickname of Maurice Boucher, the bespectacled and\noddly preppie-looking overlord of ``les Hells,'' as riders of the\noutlaw gang are known to Quebecers.
