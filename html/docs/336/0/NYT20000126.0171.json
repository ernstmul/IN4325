(lh) \n By JIM ROBBINS   \n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   HELENA, Mont. _ Dan Dodge's 12-year-old son, Jake, was playing\noutside the family home in this mountain-ringed town when his\nfather heard him yell, ``There's a mountain lion!'' Dodge looked\nout the window to see a dun-colored cat crouched about 30 feet away\nfrom a picnic table, moving stealthily toward his son.\n\n   Dodge ran to his bedroom and grabbed a .270-caliber rifle.\nFiring from inside the house, he dropped the 115-pound female cat\nwith several shots.\n\n   ``We see bear,'' Dodge, a painting contractor, said. ``We see\nmoose. We see a lot of wildlife and leave them alone. When they\ncome in stalking your kid, that's different.''\n\n   Dodge called to alert the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife\nand Parks, which approved his course of action. Pete Johnson, the\nconservation officer who investigated the shooting, said: ``Lions\nare unpredictable. If the kid had taken off running it could have\ntriggered the predatory response in the lion.''\n\n   The incident is one of a growing number of people-predator\nconflicts, not deep in the wilderness but in the housing\ndevelopments that now encroach on the wide-open spaces. Thanks to\nbetter roads, cellular phones, Federal Express deliveries and a\nlatte shop in almost every small town in the West, more and more\npeople want to live amid nature in the raw.\n\n   But so, of course, do wild animals. From the Rust Belt through\nthe Sun Belt, once nearly invisible predatory creatures with sharp\nfangs and long claws are routinely making their way into places\nwhere development is growing and people are living. As the problem\nbecomes more acute for the animals, wildlife experts are\nencouraging communities to try new strategies to avoid killing\nthem.\n\n   Merely warning people to avoid bears, cougars and alligators\nwould seem to be tricky. ``There's a fine line between fear and\nrespect,'' said Michael Korn, coordinator for the Department of\nFish, Wildlife and Parks in Helena, Mont. ``We don't want people\nrunning up the hillside with torches yelling, `Kill the monster!'\nPeople can live with lions by knowing how they operate.''\n\n   Both people and predator populations are growing in pristine\nlocations, according to state records. In Washington, the\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife reported nearly a doubling of\ncougar sightings from 1996 to 1998 (from 495 to 927), mostly around\npopulated areas. And in the last 15 years, the cougar population\nhas grown from 1,500 to 2,500.\n\n   Until the 1960s, there were bounties on predators. Until very\nrecently, they were routinely killed if they showed up near homes.\nBut the public has made it clear through voter initiatives and\nsupport of wildlife conservation groups that it wants wildlife\nprotected, especially ``charismatic megafauna'' _ a scientific term\nfor animals that are big and furry and likable, like mountain lions\nand bears. As a result, the hunting and trapping of mountain lions\nis now banned in California, Oregon and Washington. Indeed, some\nhumans are more than happy to toss birdseed, suet and dog food\naround the perimeter of their property. So predators have developed\nan appetite for close encounters.\n\n   On the shores of Whitefish Lake in Montana, Julie Duncan was\nfined $120 last year for putting out clams and oysters so she could\nvideotape black bears coming down to her yard. Officials\nintercepted a grizzly making its way to the feast.\n\n   In Florida, people frequently wander up to alligators on the\n18th green and offer them a treat.\n\n   Wildlife once rarely and furtively glimpsed now routinely prowl\nporches, driveways, golf courses and schoolyards. ``Five to eight\nyears ago, calls about bears and lions were isolated,'' Korn said.\n``Now they're a large part of what we deal with.'' Dogs, cats, pet\nllamas, goats and sometimes people have become easy pickings.\n\n   Some environmentalists believe the solution should not be\ndirected at the wildlife but at people who encroach onto the\nwildlife's turf. And there's a battle in nearly every state over\nreining in sprawl. ``First and foremost, the problem comes from\nhumans living, working and recreating in predator habitat,'' said\nTom Skeele, executive director of the Predator Conservation\nAlliance in Bozeman, Mont., a nonprofit group that works to save\npredators. Some places, like Boulder, Colo., are buying up open\nspace around town to preserve habitat.\n\n   Different parts of the country have started education campaigns\nto keep people from being attacked, and also to keep predators from\nbeing needlessly killed. Once an animal loses its fear of people\nand begins eating off a porch, it usually must be destroyed,\nwildlife experts say.\n\n   At schools near Boulder, for example, wildlife officers teach\nschoolchildren how to be lion savvy and make themselves imposing,\nshould they encounter a wild feline. One way is by putting their\ncoats above their heads, to look taller.\n\n   In downtown Whitefish, Mont., population 5,875, a grizzly\nventured down the city's main street in the middle of the day last\nsummer. Grizzlies have also made their way to areas at the edge of\nWhitefish, a resort town, to eat garbage, said Tim Manley, who\nhandles problem grizzlies for the Montana wildlife department.\n\n   Garbage isn't the only feeding problem. In much of the West, new\nhomes are landscaped with plants like arborvitae that deer find\nirresistible. Then, as the deer follow a culinary trail of apple\ntrees, tomato plants and azaleas, mountain lions follow along,\nwaiting to cull the herd.\n\n   Dry weather and poor food crops during last summer's drought in\nthe East sent black bears into suburbs from New Hampshire to\nPennsylvania, where they raided barbecue grills and even\nrefrigerators. In New Jersey, where the number of black bear\nsightings doubled in 1999 from the previous year, children at one\nbus stop were frightened by an errant bear. Homeowners in\nPennsylvania regularly find black bears hibernating under their\npatios.\n\n   No matter what the predator, the problem is the same. ``They\ndon't know where a handout ends and a hand begins,'' said Frank\nMazzotti, a University of Florida wildlife researcher who has\nstudied alligators and crocodiles. But if the predator takes too\nbig a bite, it is killed, and there is a backlash against the\nspecies. ``And that's not the animal's fault,'' he said.\n\n   nn\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Mountain lions, a fast predator with paws the size of a\ncatcher's mitt, pose the most widespread problems throughout the\nWest. There have been numerous fatal attacks, almost all of them on\nchildren or women because they are similar in size to the lion's\nnatural prey, deer.\n\n   The lions don't always win. In 1994, an old lion with few teeth\nattacked Suzanne Groves, 25, a biologist, as she took stream\nsamples in the Mancos River in southern Colorado. The lion bit the\nback of her head and held her under water for several seconds. The\ntwo wrestled, and the woman ended up on top, with her arm in the\nlion's mouth to hold it down. Then she grabbed a pair of forceps\nand stabbed the animal, which ran away. It was later shot by\nwildlife agents.\n\n   ``The only way you're going to win a fight with a cougar is if\nit doesn't have any teeth,'' said Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for\nthe Colorado Division of Wildlife.\n\n   In South Florida, ``any body of water larger than a puddle can\nhave an alligator in it,'' Mazzotti said. Since 1948 in the South,\nthere have been some 200 recorded attacks on people by alligators,\neight of them fatal.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   Trapping predators in suburban settings is becoming a critical\nart. The job usually falls to wildlife agents.\n\n   In the old days, a wolf and coyote ``getter,'' an unmanned\ngunlike device covered with meat that shot deadly sodium cyanide\ninto the animal's mouth, was used. The gun would go off when the\nanimal pulled on the meat. Now wildlife agents load getters with\ntranquilizers. Tranquilizer darts also are being designed into a\nspecial collar on captured, and then released, wildlife. A\nbiologist can activate it by remote control anytime, anywhere. Then\nthey can pick up the animal as it dozes.\n\n   Some wolf collars emit a radio frequency if they wander into\nsomeone's yard, setting off sirens and strobe lights that scare the\npredator.\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   The mountain lion problem is so acute in some states that\nwildlife officials have suggested allowing hunters to use tracking\nhounds once again. ``Given the growing number of complaints, we are\nno longer able to provide service at the level the public wants,''\nsaid Steve Pozzanghera, assistant director of the Washington\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife. His department this month asked\nthe legislature for the funding to create a kind of wildlife SWAT\nteam that would be ready to respond to conflicts and to educate the\npublic.\n\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n   In Whitefish, they're trying aversive-conditioning modification\nto teach grizzly bears to fear humans. ``We push them out using\nrubber bullets, bean bag rounds and cracker rounds,'' Manley said.\n\n   Experts from the Wind River Bear Institute in Heber City, Utah,\na nonprofit conservation group, bring in fearless Kirilean bear\ndogs from Finland that will aggressively chase a grizzly bear and\nhopefully condition it to stay out of inhabited areas.\n\n   But no one expects the problem to go away. ``As human population\nincreases and habitat is altered,'' Pozzanghera said, ``you will\nsee increasing conflicts with wildlife.''\n","Headline":"\nMAN VS.
