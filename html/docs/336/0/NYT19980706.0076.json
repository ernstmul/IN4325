That's part of what's driving this.''\n\n   Baylor has used live bears as mascots since World War I, when a\nbear named Ted was given to the university by the Army's 107th\nEngineers after they received orders to leave Camp MacArthur in\nWaco.\n\n   The two bears now acting as mascots are Ginny, 2 1/2, and Bill\nBoyd, 9.\n\n   Traditionally, Baylor has trotted out the bears at football\ngames, both at home and away. However, the school's entry into the\nfar-flung Big 12 conference has restricted the mascots' traveling\nin recent years.\n\n   ``Baylor's away games are getting farther and farther away,''\nBrumley said. ``It's really become impractical to take a live\nmascot along.''\n\n   Brumley also said athletic directors are increasingly refusing\nto allow live mascots brought into stadiums for liability reasons.\n\n   Baylor had planned to bring in a cub this year as a replacement\nfor Ginny, the younger bear taken to games for the last two years.\nHowever, difficulty in finding a new home for Ginny scotched those\nplans.\n\n   ``Placing a bear is not like placing a dog,'' said Rosie\nRoegner(NO)cq(RO), nongame permit coordinator for Texas Parks and\nWildlife. ``Black bears require a special diet _ you just can't go\ndown to the store and get bear chow _ and special facilities.\nThey're not easy to place.''\n\n   Roegner said Baylor's permit allows it to keep its bears on\npublic display ``for educational purposes.'' The permit is good\nuntil Aug. 30, 2001.\n\n   Baylor used to place its former mascots in zoos and wildlife\nparks such as the defunct Texas Safari in Clifton. However, Roegner\nsaid such sites are no longer hungry for out-of-work bears.\n\n   ``The black bear is a rare species, but it's not something\npeople go out of their way to see,'' she said. ``Zoos are not eager\nto get them at all.''\n\n   In 1940, the Baylor Chamber of Commerce, the campus organization\nthat looks after the mascots, raised $2,500 to build the first\npermanent home for the school's bears. The so-called Bear Pit gave\nway in 1977 to a plaza across from the student center that features\na large roaming area, a waterfall and a viewing area for\nspectators.\n\n   Baylor bears have marched in homecoming parades, been\nphotographed with governors and even a president. Ronald Reagan\nhelped Abner the Bear down a Dr Pepper during a 1980 campaign stop\nin Waco.\n\n   Baylor's most famous mascot was a former carnival bear named Joe\nCollege. Yell leader Bill Boyd _ for whom one of the present\nmascots was named _ bought the bear, who started the famous routine\nof drinking soda water at Baylor games in the '30s.\n\n   Joe College's popularity endured even after his death. His head\nwas mounted and hung over the scoreboard at Rena Marrs McLean\nGymnasium.\n\n   But Baylor's use of a live mascot came under attack in 1991 from\na San Antonio wildlife park director: Lynn Cuny, director of\nWildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation, which had taken in a former\nBaylor mascot. Cuny called it inappropriate for a school educating\nyoung people to act responsibly to use an endangered animal as a\nmascot.\n\n   Brumley said the school still receives correspondence\nquestioning its practice of having live mascots.\n\n   ``I wouldn't characterize it as an aggressive campaign, but it's\nsomething we're taking into consideration,'' Brumley said.\n\n   A decision on whether to keep the tradition of having live\nmascots will be made by the Chamber of Commerce and the\nadministration. Don't look for a decision until at least fall,\nBrumley said.\n\n   Whatever is decided, Baylor could continue to have a live mascot\nfor a number of years to come, said the Chamber of Commerce's\nfaculty adviser.\n\n   ``As long as the professional trainers tell us Ginny is healthy\nand doing well, there's no reason to retire her as mascot,'' said\nSteve Sadler, assistant director of the honors program. ``She could\nbe the mascot for a long time.''\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WACO, Texas _ Baylor University is considering phasing out its\ntradition of using a live bear as its mascot, according to\nspokesman Larry Brumley.\n","\n   ``In the past when we retired bears we found new homes for them\nat zoos and wildlife parks,'' Brumley said. ``Now we're running\ninto challenges finding acceptable places for the bears to retire\nto.
