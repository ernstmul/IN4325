That seems to be the only question the\nIsraeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a\nresult, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than\nvice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active\nterrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.\nIndeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah\nthat has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that\nhas been making innocents suffer.  \n\n   (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  \n\n   (700 words)  \n\n     Moved as BC-BACK-OFF-HEZBOLLAH-ECONOMIST-NYTSF      \n     \n\n     AMERICA'S RIGHT.
