Times News Service    \n\n   DURBAN, South Africa _ On the radio waves and television\nscreens, the conflict often appears stark and simple: The battle in\nZimbabwe, it seems, is a battle between blacks and whites.\n\n   The aggressors are the landless black supporters of President\nRobert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Their enemies are the prosperous white\nfarmers, who own more than half of that country's fertile land. The\nissue is land redistribution and the prominent victims are white\nmen whose haggard faces feature on the evening news here in\nZimbabwe's neighbor, South Africa, and abroad.\n\n   But what, then, accounts for the predominantly black body count?\n\n   Over the last month, 11 people have been killed in Zimbabwe. Of\nthose victims, only two were white. In reality, the people bearing\nthe brunt of that country's seething political violence are poor,\nlandless and overwhelmingly black.\n\n   The truth is that the struggle in Zimbabwe is less about race\nand land than it is about one ruling party's struggle to keep its\nvirtual monopoly of power. For while Mugabe rages about the white\nenemy, his supporters have quietly recognized that ordinary blacks\npose the more potent political threat.\n\n   It is the black majority that has the power to end the ruling\nparty's overwhelming control of Parliament in coming elections, now\ntentatively scheduled for May. And for the first time in 20 years,\nthe ordinary blacks of Zimbabwe _ who are weary of soaring\ninflation, deepening poverty and government corruption _ seem\ninclined to do just that. Most of the blacks who died were killed\nbecause they opposed Mugabe's government.\n\n   ``You have a situation where more and more black people are\nsaying, `Let's get rid of this government,''' said John Makumbe, a\npolitical science professor at the University of Zimbabwe. ``And\nviolence is being perpetrated against them.''\n\n   The whole land and race issue is a classic diversion of\nattention from the real issues which are facing this country, high\nlevels of unemployment, inflation and poverty,'' Makumbe said.\n``What you really have is a government under siege trying to\nsurvive.''\n\n   Opponents of the government call it old-style despotism. And it\nrings a strikingly discordant note in a corner of the world where\ndemocracy and freedom of political expression has flourished in\nrecent years.\n\n   Last year, four democracies here at the foot of the continent _\nSouth Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mozambique _ elected presidents\nin contested elections that were deemed free and fair.\n\n   And leaders from this region who have willingly and freely given\nup power _ men like Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Sir Ketumile\nMasire of Botswana _ are winning respect as elder statesmen as they\nmediate conflicts in Burundi and Congo.\n\n   And then there is Mugabe, who once inspired and sheltered black\nfreedom fighters across the region. But today, as he and his allies\nsupport illegal land invasions of white-owned farms and stand by\nwithout condemning attacks on opposition party members, many people\ncannot help but shake their heads.\n\n   Mugabe and his party, many critics say, have become too hungry\nfor power.\n\n   ``He's almost a caricature of all the things people think black\nAfrican leaders do,'' said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.\n``He seems to be wanting to make a cartoon of himself.\n\n   ``I am shattered because Mugabe is one of the most highly\nqualified and most able leaders,'' Tutu said, in remarks to\nEuropean journalists that were published in news reports here.\n``One just wants to weep. It's very sad.''\n\n   Mugabe's governing party currently controls all but three seats\nin Parliament. But it seems likely that voters will whittle away at\nthat dominant position.\n\n   In February, voters handed Mugabe his first political defeat\nsince he became president 20 years ago. They rejected a\nconstitutional amendment that would have expanded his powers and\nallowed the government to seize white-owned land without\ncompensation.\n\n   The serious attacks on black opponents began within weeks of\nthat defeat. And government critics say the ruling party has\ndeliberately played down those killings, hoping to distract the\npublic with vigorous rhetorical attacks on Zimbabwe's white\nminority, who dominate the economy but make up less than 2 percent\nof the population.\n\n   The black victims include an electrician, a policeman, a\npregnant woman and the driver of Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition\nparty leader; they were killed in clashes with supporters of the\ngovernment.
