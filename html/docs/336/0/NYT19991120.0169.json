Times News Service    \n\n   AMHERST, Mass. _ Emerging slightly dazed from an exam into the\nbrisk early evening air, Sarah Shumaker was approached by three\nfellow students who offered to accompany her to her destination at\nthe University of Massachusetts here. The conversation took place\njust yards from where a series of attacks on women had occurred in\nrecent weeks.

The\nlatest, in which a woman was grabbed from behind and cut on the\nface with a knife, occurred last week, just before 2 p.m., less\nthan 100 yards from where 500 people were holding a rally for\ncampus safety.

Experts warn, however, that rapes are significantly\nunderreported and that the vast majority of those that are reported\ninvolve an attacker known to the victim.\n\n   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst, with 25,422\nstudents, reported more ``forcible sex offenses'' in 1996 and 1997\nthan any university in the country other than Colorado State\nUniversity and the University of Southern California, both of which\nhave slightly larger student populations, statistics published by\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education last May show.
