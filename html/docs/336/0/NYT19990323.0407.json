OFFICER SHOOTS PIT BULL ATTACKING 85-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AND HER\nDOG\n\n (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) \nBY PHILLIP W. BROWNE AND RICK ORLOV  \n c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  \n\n   LOS ANGELES _ A pit bull attacked an 85-year-old woman and her\nLhasa apso Tuesday before an off-duty LAPD detective shot the dog\nto death, authorities said.\n\n   The woman, whose identity was not released, was treated for\nbites to her hand, police said. Her dog was treated for injuries.\n\n   The 7 a.m. pit bull attack in the Panorama City community of Los\nAngeles' San Fernando Valley was the latest in a series citywide\nthat has prompted widespread abandonment of the pets at animal\nshelters.\n\n   In an effort to cut the number of stray dogs, Los Angeles City\nCouncilman Mark Ridley-Thomas proposed that all dog and cat owners\nbe required to spay or neuter their pets or pay a higher fee to be\nlisted as animal breeders.\n\n   ``It is now common to see stray dogs roaming the streets, many\nof which are injured, sick, hungry or running (in) packs,''\nRidley-Thomas said. ``They frighten residents, attack humans and\nother dogs and pose a threat to the public safety of the city.''\n\n   The proposal calls for the Board of Animal Service Commissioners\nto report back in 45 days with proposals.\n\n   The department killed nearly 60,000 cats and dogs in 1997, an\nestimated 44,000 of which were strays.\n\n   The humane community generally agrees with the proposal, said\nGini Barrett, a member of the Animal Services Commission and\ndirector of the Humane Society.\n\n   ``This is cutting-edge thinking,'' Barrett said. ``This really\nsays the city is going to take pet overpopulation and animal safety\nvery seriously. There are a number of responsible pet owners who\nwill object to this, but it will be up to them to make their\ncase.''\n\n   In the Panorama City attack, police said shooting the dog was\nthe only way to stop the attack.\n\n   ``A lot of times officers try to use pepper spray on a dog\nfirst, and resort to deadly force later,'' said Foothill Division\nCapt. Ken Garner. ``In a situation of life or death like this could\nhave been, the deadly force was warranted.''\n\n   Jackie David, Animal Regulation spokeswoman, said the northeast\nSan Fernando Valley gets a special enforcement twice a week,\ncatching about 28 dogs each time.\n\n   ``There are several packs of dogs there that feed on small\nanimals and discarded food.
