Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9:  \n\n   The proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by\nblack farmers against the U. S. Department of Agriculture for\nracial discrimination in farm loans probably will not curb the\ndecline of independent black farmers, who now account for only 1\npercent of the farming force. But it provides some redress to many\nwho have had their livelihoods destroyed by illegal practices.\n\n   The 1997 lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than 1,000 black\nfarmers. Under the settlement, farmers who can produce some\nevidence that they suffered discrimination in the loan programs\nbetween 1981 and 1997 would receive $50,000 tax-free and be\nforgiven their federal farm debts. Those who can document with\nprecision that they suffered greater financial harm can get a\nhigher recovery from an arbitrator. Others can continue their\nsuits.\n\n   The loan programs, which are supposed to aid farmers who fail to\nget commercial bank loans, were administered by local county\ncommittees. In some Southern states, the disparity in loans to\nwhites and blacks was large. It often took three times longer to\nprocess an application from a black farmer than from a white\nfarmer. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has attacked this\nshameful history by, among other things, taking away the power of\nlocal committees to approve loans.\n\n   Bipartisan leaders in Congress helped make restitution to the\nfarmers possible by waiving the two-year federal statute of\nlimitations that would have barred many from recovering in court.\nThe settlement will not make whole those who already have lost\ntheir farms, but it will give desperately needed help to those\nstill hanging on.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: RECOMPENSE FOR BLACK FARMERS  \n(DW)\n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9:  \n","\n   The proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by\nblack farmers against the U.
