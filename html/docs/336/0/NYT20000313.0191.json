I can't bear to go by\nthere.''\n\n   Darrell Keith Rich, 45, the man convicted of raping Selix and\nthen tossing her off the bridge 100 feet to her death, is scheduled\nto be executed early Wednesday. He will be the eighth person to die\nin California since capital punishment resumed in 1992.\n\n   Rich grew up about mile from the Tidwells' home in Cottonwood, a\ncommunity south of Redding. Plenty of people knew Rich, but no one\nknows how he turned out so bad.\n\n   In the summer of 1978, he killed Selix and three women and raped\nfive others.\n\n   ``It was a reign of terror,'' said Shasta County Sheriff's Lt.\nBradd McDannold, who also grew up in Cottonwood and knew both the\nRich and Tidwell families. ``Women were being attacked that summer\nat random. He terrorized everyone in this community. People were\npanic-stricken. We never had much crime here, and then all the\nsudden women are disappearing.''\n\n   Many residents of Redding, Cottonwood and other small towns in\nShasta County recall the case.\n\n   Rich was adopted and grew up in Cottonwood, an unincorporated\nranching community about 220 miles northeast of San Francisco and\n18 miles south of Redding.\n\n   McDannold said that Rich's father ran a welding shop and\nrepaired farm equipment for just about every family in the area.\nAfter high school, Rich worked for his dad and did other odd jobs.\n\n   ``We all knew him,'' McDannold said. ``He did some of the rowdy\nthings kids do at that age, but there wasn't anything real violent\nin his background.''\n\n   But the 23-year-old Rich erupted with sexual violence during the\nsummer of 1978. He started by raping a woman on June 13. Then he\nsexually attacked two others in the next two weeks. On July 4, he\ncommitted his fourth rape. Later that day he struck again, this\ntime killing his victim. He raped Annette Edwards, 19, then bashed\nin her skull.\n\n   Two weeks later, he grabbed a 15-year-old girl who was riding\nher bike in Red Bluff. He raped and beat her, but she survived.\n\n   That August, he sexually assaulted and killed two women,\nPatricia ``Pam'' Moore, 17, in Redding and Linda Slavik, 27, whom\nhe met in a bar in Chico. He killed her after showing her Moore's\nbody.\n\n   Slavik's parents, Waldo and Twyla Yates, said they had\nnightmares about her death.\n\n   Her son, Chris Slavik, declined to be interviewed. But he wrote\na letter to the Board of Prison Terms stating his opposition to\nRich's plea for clemency. He was 9 at the time of his mother's\ndeath and spent years in therapy. He said the killing had caused\nhim to lose both parents because his grief-stricken father had\ndrifted into a life of alcohol and drugs.\n\n   Annette Selix was Rich's final victim.\n\n   ``That was the one crime that offended people here the most,''\nMcDannold said. ``How could he kill that little girl?''\n\n   McDannold and his colleague Rusty Brewer caught Rich after the\nkiller reported to the police that he had innocently stumbled onto\nthe bodies of Slavik and Moore.\n\n   ``We didn't believe him,'' McDannold said. ``We were suspicious\nright away.''\n\n   They got a detailed confession from Rich 10 days after Selix\ndied.\n\n   ``But he never told me why,'' McDannold said.\n\n   There is little sympathy for Rich in Cottonwood.\n\n   The Tidwells, the Yateses and many others testified in favor of\nexecuting Rich in a hearing last week in Sacramento before the\nBoard of Prison Terms, which then made a confidential\nrecommendation to Gov. Gray Davis on whether to approve Rich's plea\nfor clemency.\n\n   ``It's difficult for me to envision a more worthy candidate for\nthe death penalty than Mr. Rich,'' said Shasta County District\nAttorney McGregor Scott.\n\n   Davis, a Democrat, denied the clemency request Friday, making it\nnearly certain that Rich will die on Wednesday.\n\n   ``There is absolutely nothing about Mr. Rich's brutal behavior\nthat warrants clemency,'' Davis said in a statement.\n\n   No governor has accepted such a plea in the eight years since\nexecutions have returned to California.\n\n   Since 1980, when the jury convicted Rich and ruled that he\nshould die, Rich has had little success in the courts.\n\n   ``To even the most hardened eye, the crimes were almost\nunimaginably brutal _ savage attacks on defenseless young women,\nall sexually ravaged,'' a federal appeals judge, Michael Daly\nHawkins, wrote in a March 1999 ruling upholding Rich's death\nsentence.\n\n   The last Californian to be executed was Manuel Babbitt, killed\nby injection last May for killing a 78-year-old Sacramento woman\nduring a robbery and attempted rape in 1980.\n","Headline":"\n      COMMUNITY SHOWS LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR CONVICTED RAPIST, KILLER \n","Text":["\n   COTTONWOOD, Calif. _ There is a short stretch of Interstate 5 in\nNorthern California that brings back the pain for Sharon and David\nTidwell.\n","\n   It is a nondescript freeway bridge over a steep ravine just\nsouth of Mount Shasta where 22 years ago the Tidwells' daughter,\nAnnette Selix, was thrown to her death at age 11.\n","\n   ``We can't drive by with getting hurt by the memories,'' David\nTidwell said. ``It's just too much for us.
