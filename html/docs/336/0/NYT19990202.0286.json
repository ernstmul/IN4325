The database has been used\nfor about 300 studies on the effects of drugs, including the first\nto show that aspirin can prevent heart attacks, said Jick.\n\n   For the current study, the researchers analyzed the records of\n3,315 people (three-fourths of whom were men) who had first heart\nattacks between 1992 and 1997, and compared the drugs they had\ntaken with those used by 13,139 other patients without heart\nattacks. All of the patients were healthy and had no important risk\nfactors for heart disease.\n\n   The analysis showed that people who took antibiotics belonging\nto two categories _ tetracyclines or quinolones _ once or momre in\nthe three years had about one-third fewer heart attacks than those\nwho hadn't taken antibiotics during that time. Those antibiotics\nare effective against a type of bacteria, chlamydia pneumoniae,\nthat has been linked to heart attacks.\n\n   But patients who had taken other kinds of antibiotics, known as\nmacrolides, sulfonamides, penicillins, or cephalosporins, suffered\nheart attacks at the same rate as those taking no antibiotics.\n\n   This pattern suggests, the scientists say, that the drugs fought\nchlamydia infections and protected some men from heart attacks. It\nis not known how the bacteria would cause heart attacks, but there\nare several scenarios, including one in which the germs attack the\nlining of coronary arteries, causing an injury that leads to a\nbuildup of clots and formation of a plaque that later ruptures.\n","Headline":"\nANTIBIOTICS REDUCE HEART ATTACKS, STUDY SHOWS \n","Text":["\n   Adding weight to a theory that infections may cause some heart\nattacks, Boston University researchers are reporting that people\nwho took certain antibiotic drugs during a three-year period had\nsubstantially fewer first heart attacks than those who had not\nreceived antibiotics.\n","\n   The antibiotics presumably were protective because they battled\ninfections caused by a type of bacteria that has been implicated in\nheart disease in previous studies.\n","\n   While the findings strengthen an association between infections\nand heart disease that several studies have made in recent years,\nthey don't confirm the notion, the scientists pointed out.\n","\n   ``This is a crude, indirect way of looking at the data, but the\nresults are certainly worth paying attention to,'' said Dr. Hershel\nJick, an author of the report in the current Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association.\n","\n   The study in no way suggests that people should take antibiotics\nin an effort to prevent or treat heart disease, emphasized an\neditorial accompanying the report.\n","\n   Even if further research confirms the link between germs and\nheart attacks, wrote Dr. Aaron R.
