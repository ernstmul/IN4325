(mk) \n By BLAINE HARDEN   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   RICHMOND, Va. _ Virginians are struggling to decide what odors\nwafting out of New York City smell more foul _ mushrooming mounds\nof garbage or uppity pronouncements from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n\n   Nostrils flared across the Old Dominion last week at news of a\npossible tripling of deliveries of New York City garbage. Up to 2.2\nmillion tons a year, Virginians learned, could be heading up the\nJames River, bound for landfills in a state that already is\nembarrassed to place second (behind Pennsylvania) as America's top\ngarbage destination.\n\n   Noxious as the news was _ Gov. James Gilmore III called it\n``highly unacceptable'' and spoke of his ``duty'' to ban garbage\nbarges on state rivers _its perceived toxicity was quickly exceeded\nby the mayor's statement about why non-New Yorkers have garbage\nobligations.\n\n   In exchange for the top-drawer culture that visitors soak up in\nNew York, the mayor argued, they should be willing to bury some\ntrash back home. A ``reciprocal relationship,'' he called it.\n\n   In this state where people take pride in their manners, the\nmayor's reasoning has incited widespread outbreaks of incivility.\nLong-simmering suspicions about Yankees _ their arrogance, their\npushy politicians and the unspeakable nature of their garbage _ are\nsuddenly boiling over.\n\n   ``Now let me see if I got it right,'' said state Sen. William\nBolling, a Republican and longtime critic of out-of-state trash.\n``I come up to New York and I spend my hard-earned money and\nsomehow in exchange for that privilege, I am supposed to take your\ntrash? This represents a certain arrogant attitude that is not\nconsistent with the way we do business in Virginia. I can't think\nof a single issue that has made my blood boil more than this.''\n\n   In an interview Sunday at the governor's mansion, Gilmore, a\nRepublican, said he was ``offended'' by the Republican mayor's\nreasoning on garbage, which he described as ``really an outrageous\nstatement.''\n\n   ``To come out and basically try to further the discussion by\nsaying we had a moral obligation because some Virginians from time\nto time visit New York is not proper,'' said Gilmore.\n\n   The governor said he was concerned that the image of Virginia,\nwhich he described as ``one of the top technology states in the\ncountry,'' with more than 1,000 high-tech companies, including\nAmerica Online, was being unfairly maligned by the trash issue.\n\n   ``We are very much on the rise and we don't want anyone to get\nthe impression that Virginia is only good as a garbage\nrepository,'' Gilmore said.\n\n   The mayor's office has dismissed such comments, which resounded\nhere in the state capital during last week's opening of the General\nAssembly, as mere carping from ``pandering politicians trying to\nachieve their own agenda.''\n\n   Not just politicians are peeved. Business leaders with\nmultimillion-dollar investments in garbage importation speak\nbitterly of the public-relations disaster they say the mayor has\ncreated.\n\n   ``After this past week, when people here say Yankee trash, they\nthink it's redundant,'' said Charles Carter III, an 11th-generation\nVirginian whose family owns Port Tobacco at Weanack, a\nstate-of-the-art facility for containerized garbage on the James\nRiver.\n\n   Carter finds it hard to believe that Giuliani is entertaining\nthoughts of running for national elective office.\n\n   ``Giuliani couldn't have said anything that could have harmed\nhis own cause more. He is definitely not presidential material,''\nCarter said.\n\n   If Virginia's governor and the Legislature follow through on\nlast week's threats to ban garbage barges on the river _ and there\nare constitutional reasons why such a state ban might not hold up\nin court _ Carter stands to lose lots of money. He says his family\ndoes not have the resources to take the state on in a long court\nbattle.\n\n   Carter's advice to the mayor: ``We'll take the trash, but keep\nyour mouth shut.''\n\n   The largest company that disposes of New York's garbage in\nVirginia is Waste Management Inc. of Houston. It has invested $15\nmillion in Port Tobacco and had planned to begin barge shipments\nthere in April. Asked if the mayor had helped Waste Management in\nits delicate negotiations with the governor and the Legislature, a\ncompany spokeswoman, Christine Meket, who has been dispatched to\nRichmond for damage control, said, ``No.''\n\n   For years, environmental groups, investigative reporters and a\nfew lawmakers in Virginia have tried to raise public awareness of\nwhat they see as the ecological and road-safety risks of the\nstate's rapidly increasing importation of garbage. The business has\nboomed here in the last decade, creating giant landfills located\nmostly in land-rich, cash-poor African-American communities in\ncentral Virginia.\n\n   New York City, driven by the legal deadline to close its\nlandfill at Fresh Kills on Staten Island by Dec. 31, 2001, has\nbecome Virginia's fastest-growing source of garbage.\n\n   Garbage-truck accidents, complaints about putrid odors and state\nrecords documenting the arrival of untreated syringes and vials of\nhuman blood have all raised public awareness here about trash\nrolling into this state from New York. A poll released last week by\nVirginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public Policy found\nthat 87 percent of Virginians want to cap trash shipments into the\nstate.\n\n   But Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Giuliani, said Sunday that\nat least some Virginians welcomed New York's trash. ``Simply put,\nthis is a business that creates jobs and generates economic\nactivity,'' he said. ``New York City has already been contacted by\na number of communities in Virginia that want this trade.'' He\nwould not say which communities wanted the city's garbage. But he\nsaid the city had no choice but to find alternatives to Fresh\nKills.\n\n   nn\n\n   But judging by comments this weekend from shoppers at a mall\noutside Richmond, Giuliani has been uniquely effective in\ncrystallizing attitudes toward big-city garbage in the minds of\naverage Virginians.\n\n   ``I had not been thinking about it until Giuliani made his\nremarks,'' said Kitty Jones, 55, a school secretary from Henrico\nCounty who was having lunch on Saturday outside the Chick-Fil-A\nbooth in the food court at Virginia Center Commons mall.\n\n   Since reading about the mayor in the papers and watching him on\ntelevision in the past week, Ms. Jones said she had found herself\nwondering why Giuliani would say such a thing and what kind of town\nwould support such a man.\n\n   ``When you think of New York, you think of arrogance,'' Ms.\nJones said, adding that it was probably unfair to judge a whole\ncity on the basis of its mayor's behavior. ``I'm sure they are all\nnot like that, are they?''\n\n   In the Virginia Legislature this year _ an election year here _\ngarbage is emerging as the hot-button issue. On one side, there are\nquality-of-life complaints, especially from lawmakers in affluent\nnorthern Virginia, where highways in the Washington suburbs are\ninundated with out-of-state garbage trucks.\n\n   On the other, there is the deepening dependence of central\nVirginia counties on revenue from landfills. In Charles City County\nsouth of Richmond, $32 million in revenue from a landfill that\ntakes New York City garbage has allowed county supervisors to build\na new school system and an industrial park and to cut property\ntaxes by 40 percent.\n\n   Adding to the legislative mix, according to state records, is an\nincreasing flow of campaign money from waste industry companies.\n\n   Given the volatility of the garbage issue, state legislators on\nboth sides of the aisle here said they were stunned by both the\ncontent and the timing of Giuliani's remarks.\n\n   ``The mayor should realize that this is a hot political topic\nand the general approach should not be to fan the flames,'' said\nDelegate Kenneth Plum, chairman of the state Democratic Party.\n``But this is effectively what he has done.''\n\n   Down in Charles City County, whose 934-acre landfill is operated\nby Waste Management Inc., school leaders and county planners\nreacted more in sadness than in anger to the mayor's theory of\ninterstate garbage-culture reciprocation.\n\n   They said the county, which has a population of about 7,000\npeople, many of whom are among the poorest residents of Virginia,\nsimply cannot afford a huge, politics-driven reduction in the\namount of garbage coming into the landfill. It is ready to begin\nreceiving New York garbage from the new port on the James River _\nif the barges are not banned by the state Legislature.\n\n   ``The landfill is the biggest boon to Charles City County in\nmodern times,'' said Bill Britton, the county planning director.\n``Every tax since 1988 has either stayed the same or has been\nlowered. At the same time, we have been able to build a whole\nschool system _ not just one school _ but a $21 million school\nsystem.''\n\n   The county's school board chairman, Charles Giles, agreed\nwholeheartedly with Giuliani's statements last week that any\nattempt by Virginia to ban barge shipments of garbage would be\noverturned by federal courts.\n\n   ``We don't want anyone to interfere with interstate commerce,''\nGiles said. ``It is a constitutional right.''\n\n   Both he and Britton declined to comment on the mayor's\ninvocation of a garbage obligation in Virginia.\n\n   Carter, managing director of the family-owned port on the James\nRiver, had no such reticence.\n\n   He said that before last week's comments by the mayor, he had\nheard sketchy reports of a similar public-relations debacle in New\nJersey. In December, the mayor surprised and infuriated Gov.\nChristie Whitman with a plan to ship trash to transfer stations in\nher state.\n\n   ``I had thought that brouhaha must have been exaggerated,''\nCarter said. ``But it sounds like the mayor has apparently got a\nbig enough mouth that he not only can get his feet in it, but\nseveral other people's feet in it.''\n\n   Carter then allowed himself to ask what he described as a\nsarcastic question: ``Is the mayor always such a wonderful and wise\nperson in all his comments?''\n","Headline":"\nVIRGINIANS INDIGNANT AT GIULIANI'S TRASH TALK \n","Text":["\n   RICHMOND, Va. _ Virginians are struggling to decide what odors\nwafting out of New York City smell more foul _ mushrooming mounds\nof garbage or uppity pronouncements from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.\n","\n   Nostrils flared across the Old Dominion last week at news of a\npossible tripling of deliveries of New York City garbage.
