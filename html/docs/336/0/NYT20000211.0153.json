Ominous video fantasies of\nassorted black and Hispanic convicts coming through a prison's\nrevolving door galvanized wavering voters into believing that\nWillie or some other dark-hued rapist-murderer would be slicing his\nwicked way through their screen door the minute Dukakis became\npresident.\n\n   Hey, it wasn't pretty, but it worked. Now it's George W. Bush\nwho's the candidate, and instead of the lawyerly Dukakis, it's\nrough-and-ready John McCain who's being trashed by the Bush\npolitical operation.

McCain blamed Bush's heavy-handed\noperatives for phone banks spreading lies about his record. Still,\nthe mugging continues. With $31 million to toss at his lone\nremaining serious rival, Bush ignited a dirty ad war. Killing the\nmessenger of campaign finance reform fits right in with the\ndesperate attempt to resurrect the Bush candidacy for a lot of\nspecial interests.\n\n   The fear-spreaders in the gun lobby and the anti-abortion\nbusiness would lose their livelihood if McCain's proposed ban on\nsoft money became law. So the gun boys, and the consultants and\nfund-raisers who live off the anti-abortion movement, are linking\nhands with Bush to throttle the McCain insurgency.\n\n   The clever lads telling Gov. Bush what to do and say know from\nexperience that negative campaigning depresses turnout, and lowers\nthe proportion of cross-over Democrats and independent voters who\nmight be attracted to McCain's Braveheart campaign. So the\navalanche of mud continues to roll. McCain fights back, but he has\na puny little shotgun, against the arrayed howitzers of the Bush\nfield artillery brigade.\n\n   It is worth reconstructing the change of heart undergone by\nAtwater, who died of a brain tumor after reflection on his\nreputation as a rough-and-ready roustabout for the likes of Sen.\nStrom Thurmond (R-SC) and Bush the Elder, whose presidential\ncampaign he managed.\n\n   ``A reputation as a fierce and ugly campaigner has dogged me,''\nAtwater said before he died. ``I didn't invent negative politics. I\nam one of its most ardent practitioners.'' He publicly regretted\nthe tactics he employed for Bush Senior against Dukakis, for having\nvowed to ``strip the bark off the little bastard,'' and ``make\nWillie Horton his running mate.''\n\n   Wrote Atwater in Life Magazine: ``I am sorry for both\nstatements, the first for its naked cruelty, the second because it\nmakes me sound racist, which I am not.'' Replied Dukakis: ``He had\nthe courage to apologize. That says a lot for the man. My heart\ngoes out to his family.''\n\n   There will no doubt be apologies aplenty at the GOP convention\nthis summer in Philadelphia, when the Bush and McCain forces are\nobliged to bury the hatchet, or at least pretend to. But the rough\ntreatment in South Carolina and elsewhere resurrects the suspicion\nin this writer's mind that the Bush clan will use low blows when\nshoved against the ropes.\n\n   They tried to horse McCain off the ballot in New York. The\nlow-turnout Delaware primary Bush just won was a joke _ the GOP\napparatus Bush controlled slashed the number of polling places from\n260-plus to just 28, making a mockery of open-access rules.
