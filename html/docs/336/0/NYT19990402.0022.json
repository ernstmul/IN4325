Great ending for the winner.\nTears for the loser.\n\n   Walsh was going to change his power play two weeks ago before\nhis Black Bears lost to BC in the Hockey East championship, 3-2. He\ndidn't.

Kariya wasn't the main\nfactor. Dimitrakos, a Matignon grad, was.\n\n   ``The goal was good teamwork,'' said Dimitrakos. ``On the\novertime goal I just kept possession and circled. I wasn't worried.\nI saw Bobby break for the net and waited. I just sent him a flip\npass and it just grazed Barrett Heisten's stick before Bobby got\nit. He put it away nicely.''\n\n   Stewart, one of Maine's five seniors who couldn't vie for\ncollege hockey's Holy Grail the past three seasons because of NCAA\nsanctions, beamed. ``It was a perfect pass. Niko is one of the\nsmartest players on the team. I knew he'd see me. Clemmensen went\ndown and I went high shelf.''\n\n   Walsh said, ``Niko is one of the most talented offensive players\nin our league. I love to have him on the ice. He's a kid I wanted\non my team since I saw him playing for Matignon High School.''\n\n   Midway through the first period, Maine's Brendan Walsh of\nDorchester took a hit from BC's Andy Powers of Arlington and Walsh\nleft with an injured knee. Sixth defenseman A.J. Begg took Walsh's\nspot as second-line center.\n\n   (Shawn) Walsh said, ``Begg didn't work out all that great. So\nfrom the second period on, I double-shifted Niko and Steve Kariya\nand they did very well.''\n\n   Maine drew three penalties in a row in the second period:\nMatthias Trattnig for interference at 1:02; Heisten for\ninterference at 3:01, and Doug Janik for hooking at 4:10.\n\n   The Black Bears killed the first two and the BC power play was\nsuccessful at 5:34 when sophomore defenseman Marty Hughes of\nLawrence Academy scored his third goal of the season from 35 feet\nto the right side of Michaud.\n\n   Dimitrakos tied it, 1-1, at 2:34 of the third when he collected\na nifty pass out from Ben Guite and whipped home a high 25-footer\nto the left side.
