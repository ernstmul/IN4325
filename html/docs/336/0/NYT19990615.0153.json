Only his eyes and forehead remained when the\nmarathon surgery began.\n\n   Two months later, many of the same doctors were involved in\nreattaching the entire scalp and rebuilding the delicate back of\nthe neck of a 3-year-old Austin boy, assaulted by a Rottweiler.\n\n   Both children survived and are doing well, although they face\nnumerous follow-up surgeries.\n\n   But the reconstructive surgeons who spend hours cutting,\nclipping, moving skin and muscle around, reconnecting nerves and\nblood vessels, and sewing children back together after savage dog\nattacks don't want to talk about the surgical skills involved.\n\n   They want to talk about dog-bite prevention.\n\n   ``These are truly devastating injuries for the children\ninvolved,'' says Dr. Bill Adams, assistant professor of plastic\nsurgery at UT Southwestern. ``In the fortunate cases, we can repair\nthe injuries. However, they take multiple procedures.\n\n   ``The important thing is a significant portion of the 3 million\ndog attacks on children each year could be prevented with\neducation. That's definitely the message we want to convey,'' Adams\nsays.\n\n   Adams led the surgical team that reattached the scalp sheared\noff by the Rottweiler and was part of the team that rebuilt the\nface devastated by the pit bull. Both children were treated at\nChildren's Medical Center of Dallas.\n\n   ``Those two recent cases are the most spectacular, but I\nprobably have been involved with at least 30 people attacked by\ndogs in the last nine years. At least five required extensive\nmultiple reconstructive procedures,'' Adams says. ``If we could\nprevent just one, it would be worth any effort.''\n\n   Each year, 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs in this\ncountry; 800,000 require medical treatment, and about 65 percent of\nthose who end up in hospital emergency rooms are young children,\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control,\npart of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.\n\n   In 1995-1996, there were at least 25 deaths from dog attacks _\n20 of them children, the most recent CDC statistics show. Estimates\ncould be low by as much as 25 percent because of incomplete\ninformation on death certificates, CDC officials say.\n\n   ``Between 1979 and 1996, there were 304 fatalities from dog\nbites reported in the United States,'' says Dr. Charles Ginsburg,\nchairman of pediatrics at UT Southwestern. ``The breeds of dog\ninvolved in the attacks on children vary; however, Rottweilers, pit\nbulls and German shepherds account for more than 50 percent of all\nfatal bite-related injuries.''\n\n   ``Eighty percent of dogs that attack children belong to a friend\nor family member of the child and aren't strays,'' Adams says.\n\n   Adams also points out that some breeds are notorious for vicious\nattacks. Chows, pit bulls, Rottweilers and Doberman pinschers\nshouldn't be around children at all, he says.\n\n   ``Parents should always monitor children when they are around\ndogs, particularly dogs they don't know, and family pets should be\ntrained when they are very young to be more socialized,'' Adams\nsays.\n\n   To prevent dog-bite tragedies, the National Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control recommends:\n\n   _Realistically evaluate your environment and lifestyle before\nbuying or adopting a dog. Dogs with histories of aggression are\ninappropriate in households with children.\n\n   _Be sensitive to cues that a child is fearful or apprehensive\nand delay acquiring a dog until a child is comfortable with it.\n\n   _Spend time with a dog before buying or adopting one. Use extra\ncaution when bringing a dog into a home with an infant or toddler.\n\n   _Spay or neuter any family pet dog to reduce any aggressive\ntendencies.\n\n   _Never leave an infant or young child alone with any dog.\n\n   _Properly socialize and train any dog entering the household.\n\n   _Immediately seek professional advice from a veterinarian or\nanimal behaviorist if a dog develops aggressive or undesirable\nbehavior.\n\n   _Do not play aggressive games or wrestle with a dog.\n\n   _Never disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating or caring for\npuppies.\n\n   _Do not pet a dog without allowing it to see you and sniff you\nfirst.\n\n   _\n\n   WHAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DOG BITES Â \n\n   Most dog bites can be avoided, says Kelly Westbrook, education\nofficer for Fort Worth Animal Control, who often visits schools\nwith this message.\n\n   ``We always tell people the most important thing is to stay away\nfrom stray animals. Never approach a dog or cat that you don't\nknow,'' Westbrook says. If one approaches you, stop, stand still\nand watch it. Don't run. Dogs like to chase moving objects.''\n\n   Other safety tips Westbrook shares with children include:\n\n   _Keep your eyes on the dog, but do not make eye contact with it.\n\n   _Talk softly and gently and try to calm it down. Just say things\nlike, ``It's OK, take it easy.''\n\n   _Keep the animal in front of you and slowly back up out of the\ndog's territory, if possible.\n\n   _If you are riding a bike and a dog starts chasing you, stop,\ndismount on the side opposite the dog, keeping the bike between you\nand the dog while you talk softly and walk away from it.\n\n   _Go tell an adult as soon as possible so that the loose dog can\nbe picked up by authorities.\n\n   _If you are attacked, curl up with your hands locked behind your\nneck and your arms and elbows up around your face _ like the duck\nand cover positions taught for tornado drills.\n\n   _If you are bitten by an animal of any kind _ dog, cat or wild\nanimal _ tell an adult immediately.
