Times News Service clients)  \n By RYAN KONIG  \n c.2000 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   (PHOENIX) - Maricopa County has nearly three times the number of\nillnesses caused by tainted food and water than a community of this\nsize should have, the county's top health official says.\n\n   And two-thirds of those cases were never investigated because of\na lack of staff and money, says Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, director of\nthe county's Department of Public Health.\n\n   ``The causes could be any one of a million things,'' he said,\nranging from improperly cooked meals in homes or businesses to\npeople not washing their hands before they prepare food or eat.\n\n   ``The fact is, we simply don't know the causes. And if we don't\nknow, then we can't do anything about it.''\n\n   That's why Weisbuch says the department needs more money, about\n$130,000 from the county's general fund, this year to help pay for\nan epidemiologist, a specially trained nurse and an investigator to\nfind out what's making so many people sick.\n\n   The county Board of Supervisors could vote within 30 days on the\nhealth department's requested budget increase, Chairman Andrew\nKunasek said.\n\n   Maricopa County currently investigates about a third of the\n4,000 annual reports of food-borne and water-borne illnesses. If\nthe additional funds are approved, Weisbuch said, the county would\nbe able to investigate most of the remaining cases.\n\n   Among the cases that were investigated last year include a\nSeptember outbreak in which 500 county jail inmates suffered\nnausea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Lab tests indicate the cause\nmay have been a tainted dinner.\n\n   Another incident last year involved 21 people who became ill\nafter drinking unpasteurized orange juice blended by a Tempe-based\ncompany. That company, Sun Orchard, stopped producing unpasteurized\norange juice.\n\n   The caseload of 4,000 reported food- and water-borne illnesses\nis nearly three times higher than it should be for a community of\nthis size, based on a recent study from the national Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, Weisbuch said. The expected rate of\nthese illnesses is about 50 cases per 100,000 people, he said.\n\n   By that count, the Phoenix area should have had 1,500 cases,\ninstead of 4,000.\n\n   Weisbuch said the high number may be partly due to population\ngrowth:\n\n   ``We are adding 100,000 people every year to this community, and\n1,000 new food businesses,'' he said.\n\n   People new to the Phoenix area may need time to figure out how\nto properly store or prepare foods that are more common to this\narea, Weisbuch said. Even something as simple as leaving groceries\nin a car for too long in the summer can foster bacteria growth to\nunhealthful levels.\n\n   Improper temperature is a leading cause of food contamination,\nsaid David Ludwig, who is in charge of the food service inspections\ndivision of Maricopa County Environmental Services.\n\n   Some foods need to be heated to at least 190 degrees to kill off\nbacteria. Others foods need to be stored at low temperatures to\ncurb growth of bacteria.\n\n   There's a complicated set of heating and cooling procedures\nneeded for cooking, reheating, storing and serving different kinds\nof foods, Ludwig said. Otherwise, bacteria could grow to the point\nthat they could cause illness.   \n   \nReach the reporter at   \nRyan.Konig(at)Arizona   \nRepublic.com or (602) 444-7425.  \n","Headline":"\nTAINTED FOOD, WATER DRAWS COUNTY'S EYE \n","Text":["\n   (PHOENIX) - Maricopa County has nearly three times the number of\nillnesses caused by tainted food and water than a community of this\nsize should have, the county's top health official says.\n","\n   And two-thirds of those cases were never investigated because of\na lack of staff and money, says Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, director of\nthe county's Department of Public Health.\n","\n   ``The causes could be any one of a million things,'' he said,\nranging from improperly cooked meals in homes or businesses to\npeople not washing their hands before they prepare food or eat.\n","\n   ``The fact is, we simply don't know the causes.
