Times News Service clients)  \n By BARRY BURKHART  \n c.1999 The Arizona Republic  \n\n   PHOENIX - The inevitable happened.\n\n   A pack of Mexican gray wolves, an endangered species\nreintroduced into Arizona, attacked a domestic cattle calf on a\nranch north of Clifton.\n\n   An interagency team of biologists now is monitoring the Pipestem\nPack's movements in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest on a\n24-hour basis.\n\n   Last Tuesday, the injured calf was discovered on the T-Link\nRanch by the ranch manager.\n\n     Alan Armistead, a biologist for the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture's Wildlife Services and the wolf team's depredation\nspecialist, concluded after examining the calf that its wounds\ninclude bites and scrapes that were consistent with a wolf attack.\n\n   The calf is expected to recover from the attack.\n\n   The attack occurred in the same area, where in the middle of\nJune, biologists discovered the mostly consumed remains of two\ncalves and a partially consumed adult cow. The cow died after its\nhind leg became tangled in the strands of a barbed-wire fence.\n\n   The livestock manager was contacted after the find and\nparticipated in investigating it.\n\n   Cause of the three animals' death couldn't be determined. Both\ncoyotes and wolves were found in the area, and one or both had fed\non the carcasses. The wolf pack was in the area at that time.\n\n   Another calf was found dead last Thursday in the Pipestem Pack's\nterritory.\n\n   Monitoring of that pack has been intensified through radio\ncollars. The wolves' location will be determined every four hours,\nday and night. If the wolves move to the location of livestock,\nthey will be run off. Supplemental food is being provided near the\npack's den site.\n\n   Biologists determined the pups were born to the Pipestem Pack\nthis spring. The number hasn't been determined. This is the second\nlitter produced by the pack.\n\n   The only surviving pup for a year ago disappeared after its\nmother was illegally shot last August.\n\n   The ranch's livestock manager plans to move the cows and calves\nto another place, far away from the wolf activity.\n\n   Biologists expressed their appreciation for the cooperation of\nthe livestock manager. This is an attempt to discourage the wolves\nfrom preying on livestock.\n\n   Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization,\nwill offer compensation to the livestock owner, as is its policy\nwhen the loss or injury of domestic livestock occurs and is caused\nby wolves.\n\n   More than 24 wolves now range the Apache-Sitgreaves. That's\nnearly triple the number of last year at this time.\n\n   The first confirmed attack on domestic animals occurred in May\nof 1998. A member of the Campbell Blue pack attacked a miniature\nhorse colt. The owner was compensated by Defenders of Wildlife for\nthe veterinarian expenses, and the colt survived.\n\n   The organization also compensated owners in the wolf-recovery\nunit for the death of a ranch dog and injury of another dog,\nfollowing a fight with a wolf.   \nFire restrictions   \nLast Wednesday, fire restrictions were changed on Bureau of Land\nManagement lands.\n\n   Fire restrictions were placed on the Hualapai and Cerbat\nmountains in northwestern Arizona.\n\n   Open campfires are allowed only in developed campgrounds or\nwhere specifically posted. Propane gas stoves, lanterns and heaters\nare allowed in all areas. Smoking is allowed only in developed\ncampgrounds and recreation sites, including buildings or vehicles\nor in an area that has been cleared of flammable material.\n\n   The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest has lifted fire\nrestrictions on the Apache part of the forest. That includes the\nClifton, Alpine and Springerville ranger districts.\n\n   The area has received enough moisture to allow campfires in\ndispersed areas.   \nMammal tracking   \nGlendale Community College will offer a class on tracking mammals\non Wednesday.\n\n   The class is designed for hunters, naturalists, photographers,\nscouts and others who wish to follows the tracks and signs of wild\nanimals.\n\n   The class will include distinguishing common tracks, reading\nsubtle signs such as gnawing, droppings and claw marks plus other\ninformation.\n\n   Course registration is $14 plus $10 for the instructor.
