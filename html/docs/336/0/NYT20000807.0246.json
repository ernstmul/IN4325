Times News Service   \n\n   In the genteel days of railroad tourism, the Canadian Rockies\nhad predictable, limited flows of visitors who came to gawk at\ndramatic mountain crags that were marketed around the world as the\nsecond Switzerland. But now Banff National Park, the oldest park in\nCanada's system, has a busy, largely four-lane highway transecting\nit and an international airport only 90 minutes away, in Calgary.\nFlying to Calgary from Tokyo or piloting motor homes from Michigan,\nan estimated 4.4 million people visit the park every year, with\nanother 4 million indulging in what park officials call\n``windshield tourism'' as they drive through on the Trans-Canada\nHighway.\n\n   In the peak days in July and August, the population of Banff can\neasily quadruple from its year-round population of 7,000. ``It's\nlike a wall of metal,'' Pamela L. Veinotte, a Parks Canada tourism\nmanager, said of the lines of recreational vehicles that wind up\none mountain road to a major attraction, Moraine Lake, where still\nwaters are framed by granite peaks.\n\n   Even with high gasoline prices, the American tourist crush is\nnot expected to abate this summer. Canada is a travel bargain as\nthe American dollar fetches almost $1.50 Canadian. Even if Air\nCanada pilots conduct a slowdown or go on strike this month over\npay and working issues stemming from the airline's ongoing merger\nwith Canadian Airlines, there are alternatives. U.S. carriers offer\ndirect flights linking Calgary with major American cities _\nChicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and\nSan Francisco. With a North American open skies agreement that\nbegan to take effect five years ago, the number of Americans flying\nto Canada increased by almost 60 percent during the 1990s, putting\nCanada on a par with Britain as Americans' favorite air travel\ndestination after Mexico.\n\n   To cope with this summer's crowds at Canada's most heavily\nvisited park, planners have taken new steps to induce\nrecreational-vehicle drivers to take shuttle buses, to reduce\nconflicts between tourists and wildlife and to cut down on the\nherds of tourists tromping through Chateau Lake Louise, the\nvenerable resort hotel on the edge of the emerald lake.\n\n   Starting last June, visitors have had the option of riding free\nshuttle buses between the Lake Louise Campground and Lake Louise\nand between the campground and Lake Moraine. Although passers-by\nmay hail the buses, priority is given to drivers of recreational\nvehicles. As North American baby boomers age, park officials have\ndetected an increase in motor homes and a decrease in back country\ncamping.\n\n   Also in June, managers at Chateau Lake Louise began to put much\nof the 488-room hotel off limits to nonguests, with the exception\nof the eight restaurants and a shopping arcade. Guests, some of\nwhom were paying $250 a night for a room, had long complained of\ntourists filling up easy chairs in the hotel's famous Lakeview\nlounge.\n\n   ``It was the crowds _ people were paying a premium rate for a\nworld-class experience for Lake Louise and were not getting it,''\nJanet Eger, the hotel's director of public relations, said of the\nnew restrictions on public access.\n\n   Tourist encounters with bears, elk and wolves have long been a\nproblem along the park's central valley and the park's two towns,\nBanff and Lake Louise. After tourists were injured by elk during\ncalving season in the spring and rutting season in the fall, park\nofficials moved last winter to relocate about two-thirds of Banff's\nelk population of 400 animals to remote park areas. Two small herds\nremain and are easily visible off the eastern edge of town, around\nthe city golf course.\n\n   ``The locals notice the amount of flowers that are not eaten at\nnight,'' said Dennis R. Shuler, Banff's part-time mayor. To\nminimize conflicts with grizzlies, park officials have cracked down\non bird feeders, on the grounds they attract bears, have\ntemporarily closed some campgrounds and trails, and have harassed\nbears with noisemakers to teach them to stay away from humans.  \n\n   At Moraine Lake, where several trails were closed in past\nsummers because of grizzlies in the area, the park is experimenting\nwith allowing hikers to go out in groups of six or more, on the\ntheory that there is greater safety in numbers.\n\n   Wardens patrol the Bow Valley Parkway, an unfenced valley road\nthat parallels the Trans-Canada Highway, looking for ``bear jams,''\nor traffic backups in front of bears and other wildlife. One road\nsection now has a temporary speed limit of 20 miles an hour because\na wolf litter was spotted near the road in early June. After a\ncougar attacked and injured a loose dog near Banff in April,\nwardens increased warnings to visitors to keep dogs on leashes.\n\n   Although hotels in the park offer 8,800 beds, space tightens in\nthe peak season of July and August. In May, the neighboring town of\nCranmore closed off one loophole, passing a law that forbids\nhomeowners from renting their homes for periods of less than 28\ndays. In illustration of how tourism pressure is spilling out of\nthe park, Cranmore now fines illegal tourist homes up to $3,000 _\nmore than double the fines for unauthorized logging.\n","Headline":"\nTHE ENDURING APPEAL OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES \n","Text":["\n   In the genteel days of railroad tourism, the Canadian Rockies\nhad predictable, limited flows of visitors who came to gawk at\ndramatic mountain crags that were marketed around the world as the\nsecond Switzerland.
