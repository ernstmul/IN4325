Times News Service   \n\n   GARDEN CITY, Idaho _ When Sally Maughan steps into a large\nfenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear cubs pay her\nthe ultimate compliment.\n\n   ``They treat me like a bear,'' said Ms. Maughan, who can lumber\nabout in pretty convincing fashion. ``When I come in the door,\nthey're thinking that way. They'll take a swat at me. They'll grab\nmy shirt sleeve like it's the scruff of another bear.''\n\n   And that is the whole point, for Ms. Maughan is doing all she\ncan to get these bears back into the wild this spring. Idaho\nwildlife officials call her ``the bear lady,'' and for the last 10\nyears she has been the volunteer in charge of an unusual program\nintended to return orphaned cubs to the wilderness.\n\n   Left on their own after their mothers are killed, usually in an\nillegal hunt or sometimes by a passing truck on a remote highway,\nyoung bears will almost surely die, because they cannot forage or\notherwise fend for themselves in the first months of life. Some are\nbrought to Ms. Maughan so young that she has to bottle-feed them\nevery two hours.\n\n   ``She basically teaches them how to be bears,'' explained Kris\nVan Cleave, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Fish and\nGame.\n\n   So far, Ms. Maughan, a 52-year-old travel agent, has returned 37\nblack-bear cubs to wilderness areas across Idaho and in the Blue\nMountains of Oregon, and wildlife officials in charge of the\nreleases say follow-up observations and checks of radio tags\nindicate that nearly all have done just fine.\n\n   In perhaps the greatest testament to her success, only one of\nthe bears has shown an inclination to wander back to areas of human\nhabitation like campgrounds in search of food. (That bear was\nultimately deemed a ``nuisance bear'' and sent away to a university\nresearch project.)\n\n   ``Sally's very good at what she does,'' said Jeff Rohlman, a\nregional wildlife manager for the Fish and Game Department. ``She's\ngood at minimizing contact, at keeping the cubs somewhat leery of\nhumans, and that's exactly what you want to do with these bears.''\n\n   For Ms. Maughan, the process is something of a conundrum, since\neven as she devotes so many hours to the cubs and develops an\nobvious affection for them, the last thing she would ever want to\ndo is treat them like pets.\n\n   ``That's not the point at all,'' she said. ``If you get too\nemotionally attached, you'll wind up defeating everything you're\nworking towards. A bear wants to be free. A bear needs to be\nfree.''\n\n   What she feels when watching the bears successfully scamper off\ninto the wild is a bit akin to the intensely mixed emotions, the\npride and the sadness, that many parents experience when their\nchildren head off to college. In fact, ``bear cubs go through\ncomparable stages of development to children,'' Ms. Maughan said,\n``except that it happens over a period of months, not years.''\n\n   Until the age of 8 weeks or so, the cubs are bawling infants, in\nneed of a lot of nurturing, closeness, security, food and sleep.\nAfter that, ``they begin about a month of the terrible 2's,'' she\nsaid, when ``they need supervision, they throw their own version of\ntemper tantrums, they want what they want when they want it.''\n\n   By about six months, the teen-age stage has arrived. ``They get\na bit wild and reckless,'' she said. ``They don't use good\njudgment, and seem to feel invincible.''\n\n   And then, at last, as they near the point of their release,\n``you can breathe a sigh of relief,'' Ms. Maughan said.\n\n   ``Now it's almost like having a college student around,'' she\nsaid. ``They take an interest in their surroundings and start to\ninvestigate and really try to figure out what makes everything\ntick.''\n\n   Of course, she cannot be exactly sure of all those equivalents,\nshe said with a laugh, since she herself never reared any children.\n``I never wanted to have kids,'' said Ms. Maughan, who never\nmarried, either. ``I'm really not a people person. Let's just say\nI'm more of a bear person.''\n\n   Ms. Maughan lives in this Boise suburb with her 85-year-old\nmother, also named Sally, 18 cats (at last count), 2 coyotes\n(Pouncer, 10, and Sparkle, 8, who have successfully acted as foster\nparents to several orphaned pups in a program that returns coyotes\nto the wild as well) and a good 75 or so stray ducks.\n\n   ``She's just been this way ever since she was a little girl,''\nher mother said. ``She'd come home from school, and there'd be four\nor five dogs following her.''\n\n   In past years, Ms. Maughan has spent as much as $6,000 of her\nown money on the bears, who have a voracious appetite for a diet\nthat includes dog food, fish, fruit (especially apples and frozen\ngrapes), carrots, acorns, bees, wasps and, she said, ``an\noccasional mouse who tries to join the picnic.''\n\n   Ms. Maughan has never been injured by any of her bears. The\nclosest she ever came was when one of the cubs, nicknamed Griz,\ngrew agitated one day and gave her, well, a real bearhug. But he\neventually let go, and she was fine.\n\n   Nor has she had any problem with her neighbors in this\nonce-rural locale that is now growing like many outlying areas\naround Western cities, with suburban-style housing springing up\naround her. ``No problems, no complaints, no citations,'' said the\nGarden City planning and zoning administrator, Craig Eckles.\n\n   When they leave her, the bears weigh between 60 and 100 pounds;\nfull grown, females average about 250 pounds, while males can be\nanywhere from 300 to 500 pounds.\n\n   Every orphaned bear that is rescued and makes it back to the\nwild is a bear that in the past would have either died in the wild\nor most likely been put to death if found by wildlife officials.\nWhile black bears are common in many states, and while the North\nAmerican population is not considered to be endangered, animal\nexperts say Ms. Maughan's work should be applied to bear species\naround the world that are. Her nonprofit foundation recently\nreceived a $6,000 grant from the World Society for the Protection\nof Animals, based in London.\n\n   ``On a global basis, there's no one doing what she's doing as\nwell as she's doing it,'' said Chris Morgan, a bear specialist with\nthe society. ``There's a lot to learn from her.''\n\n   Tara Wertz, regional wildlife habitat biologist with the Oregon\nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife, who has brought cubs to Ms.\nMaughan, said: ``As far as we're concerned, she's a godsend. You\nknow, there just aren't a lot of people out there you can call on\nto take in a bear.''\n","Headline":"\nFOR THE ORPHANED LITTLE BLACK BEARS OF IDAHO, A DEN MOTHER\n","Text":["\n   GARDEN CITY, Idaho _ When Sally Maughan steps into a large\nfenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear cubs pay her\nthe ultimate compliment.\n","\n   ``They treat me like a bear,'' said Ms. Maughan, who can lumber\nabout in pretty convincing fashion. ``When I come in the door,\nthey're thinking that way.
