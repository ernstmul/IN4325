Times News Service    \n\n   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Under cover of darkness, the trucks rumble\nout from an industrial complex hidden in a wooded ravine.\n\n   Flouting the law, they speed along Virginia's roads,\ndistributing the environmental burden that is their cargo: bales of\nnewsprint amounting to 120,000 tons of solid waste per year. While\nlocal communities struggle to pay the consequences, the profits\nflow to an out-of-state corporation, The Washington Post Co.\n\n   Until now, little attention has been paid to the perils involved\nin delivering the 400,000 copies of The Washington Post printed\nhere each night. Virginians have been concentrating on another\nout-of-state menace: the trucks delivering garbage from New York\nCity. The state recently put limits on the imports, in no small\npart because of The Post's coverage.\n\n   The newspaper detailed the dangers of out-of-state trash last\nNovember in a series of three front-page articles totaling more\nthan 12,000 words. The first article began with a grim scene of\ntrucks lumbering out of the Bronx, and went on to describe the\n``terrifying'' and ``frightening'' hazards posed by speeding trucks\nwith bad safety records. It described one fatal accident on\nInterstate 95 and included complaints about the incessant parade of\ntrash trucks, which were said to make 100,000 trips annually into\nVirginia.\n\n   That statistic works out to about 275 trucks per day, which\nseems less than frightening when compared with the total traffic in\nthe southbound lanes of Interstate 95 here: 133,000 vehicles daily,\nincluding about 2,400 trucks not carrying trash. It doesn't even\nloom large by comparison with the 1,500 trucks, vans and cars\ndelivering The Washington Post each day in Virginia.\n\n   How safe is the Post fleet? A New York Times investigation _\nwhich consisted of my tailing 10 trucks leaving the plant here with\nFriday's papers _ found that 90 percent of the trucks exceeded the\nspeed limit by at least 10 miles per hour. While those safety\nviolations posed little obvious danger _ the trucks were keeping\npace with other vehicles flouting the law _ records show that\ntrucks delivering The Post have injured people.\n\n   My investigation did not impress Leonard Downie Jr., the\nexecutive editor of The Post. ``It sounds silly,'' he said. ``Our\narticle reported serious safety problems with some trucks and\ndrivers, and they travel much larger distances than trucks in\nVirginia making local deliveries of The Washington Post _ or The\nNew York Times.''\n\n   Still, why focus on a few bad drivers hauling trash when many\nothers carry more hazardous cargo? In December, a tractor-trailer\nran off the road in central Virginia while carrying a bleaching\nagent to the Bear Island Paper Company, a newsprint mill that\nsupplies The Washington Post. The chemical spilled and ignited,\nforcing nearby residents to stay inside for hours to avoid toxic\nsmoke.\n\n   The trash industry ships generally innocuous cargo, consisting\nchiefly of cardboard and paper, to be buried in new double-lined\nlandfills, surrounded by buffer zones of woods and fields, in rural\ncommunities that willingly bear the environmental costs in exchange\nfor the economic benefits. For some reason, though, a lot of city\ndwellers _ journalists, environmentalists, politicians _ are\nconvinced the countryside is being ruined. ``If we don't stop it\nnow,'' one Norfolk politician told The Post, ``we won't have any\nspace left but one big dump.''\n\n   But all the big new Virginia garbage pits together amount to\nonly three square miles. That leaves more than 40,000 square miles\nin the rest of the state, including 243 occupied by the timberland\nthat supplies the newsprint mill at Bear Island.\n\n   That newsprint eventually turns into solid waste that must be\ncollected for either recycling or disposal. Based on the average\ncost of collecting and processing solid waste, Virginia taxpayers\nare spending at least $5 million annually to get rid of old copies\nof The Post, and tens of millions of dollars to handle all the\nother newspapers that ran articles about Virginians being exploited\nby trash-exporting New Yorkers.\n\n   When you consider that New Yorkers last year sent more than $50\nmillion to Virginia along with their trash, you might wonder who's\nexploiting whom. If Virginians really care about their fiscal\nhealth and their roads and their environment, maybe they shouldn't\nworry so much about out-of-state trash.\n\n   It's an awkward question to ask in these pages, but is it time\nfor them to limit out-of-state newspapers?\n\n    \n","Headline":"\nTHE BIG CITY COLUMN: THIS HAZARD FOR VIRGINIA IS UNREPORTED \n","Text":["\n   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Under cover of darkness, the trucks rumble\nout from an industrial complex hidden in a wooded ravine.\n","\n   Flouting the law, they speed along Virginia's roads,\ndistributing the environmental burden that is their cargo: bales of\nnewsprint amounting to 120,000 tons of solid waste per year.
