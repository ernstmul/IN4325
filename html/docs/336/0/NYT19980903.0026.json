Then they cast in front of\nthe specimen like leading a receiver. When fish and dry fly\nconnect, touchdown.\n\n   It's the feeling one gets when preparing to toss an insect\nimitation or a glittery lure to an unsuspecting golden trout in one\nof the namesake bodies of water that compose the remote Cottonwood\nLakes Basin west of here.\n\n   ``Oh, yeah, you can spot the fish usually along the edges where\nthey are hanging out, cast in front of them and they do respond,''\nsaid Culver City angler Ken Wells, who was targeting the brightly\nhued trout with a gold-and-red Thomas Buoyant lure during his final\nafternoon of an eight-day Sierra Club outing.\n\n   I watched Wells hook three in 10 minutes on a recent cloudless\nSaturday, prompting my fishing partner to quickly switch from his\nunproductive fly-and-bubble rig to a hunk of hardware.\n\n   He had landed more than two dozen at Cottonwood Lakes No.3 in\nabout an hour's time, the largest measuring 14 inches _ a monster\namong the typically lilliputian goldens. Earlier in the day, even I\nhad hooked my largest fly-caught golden _ all 11 inches long _\namong the hundreds I have taken on prior backcountry hikes.\n\n   Why were these varieties so ``huge,'' so quick to charge bait\nand so bold with towering anglers looming nearby?\n\n   Lack of pressure, that's why. After being off-limits to anglers\nsince 1966 in order to protect brood stock, four of the five\nCottonwood Lakes in Inyo National Forest's John Muir Wilderness\nwere reopened to fishing July 1. It's the type of Shangri-la\nsituation for which trout anglers clamor.\n\n   ``Hey, that's great, it gives a lot more area for people to\nfish,'' said Al Crandell, a mining-company metallurgist from\nRidgecrest before making his first casts in the basin's lowermost\nlakes. ``And these fish are unbelievable. They're not very big, but\nthey are gorgeous. It's a color you can't describe.''\n\n   Indeed, as one observer noted in 1905, ``the delicate golden\nolive of the head, back and upper part of the side, the clear\ngolden yellow along and below the lateral line and the marvelously\nrich cadmium of the under parts fully entitle this species to be\nknown above all others as the golden trout.''\n\n   Endemic only to the Southern Sierra Nevada's Golden Trout Creek,\nLittle Kern River and South Fork Kern River _ just southwest of\nCottonwood Lakes Basin in the Golden Trout Wilderness _ the\ndelicate trout was designated the state fish in 1947.\n\n   It was documented in two subspecies earlier, and, well before\nthat, introduced to many nearby lakes and streams. According to the\nDepartment of Fish and Game booklet ``Golden Trout of the High\nSierra,'' the most significant transplant came in 1876, when one\nCol. Sherman Stevens carried 13 goldens in a coffeepot over four\nmiles to Cottonwood Creek so he could have trout near his sawmill.\nIn 1891, about 100 goldens were collected from the creek and hauled\nupstream to the Cottonwood Lakes.\n\n   Since 1918, Cottonwood Lakes Basin has been home to the DFG's\ngolden trout spawning operations. In years when snowpack allows\nbiologists into the basin before July 1 (El Nino-impacted 1998\nwasn't one of them), eggs are taken to produce 250,000 to 500,000\nfingerling goldens, which, in turn, are planted in regional\nbackcountry waters.\n\n   Because of their limited distribution, goldens are thought to be\nthe rarest of the primary Eastern Sierra trout, which include the\nrainbow, brook and brown.\n\n   The July 1 reopening of Cottonwood Lake Nos.1, 2, 3 and 4\ngreatly enhances the public's access to the fish.\n\n   ``If you want to add the golden to your list of trout, this is a\ngood place to do it,'' said Phil Pister, 69, of Bishop, a former\nfisheries biologist for the DFG in Bishop.\n\n   Pister qualified the statement by noting that a study two years\nago revealed that the basin's golden trout population had somehow\nbeen compromised by rainbow trout as long as 40 years ago,\nproducing what is known as a goldenbow hybrid. However, he said,\nthe subtleties are hardly noticeable to the layperson and the fish\nis still largely considered a golden.\n\n   The hybridization of the golden brood stock was less of a reason\nfor the angling reopening than the notion of adding four lakes to\nthe state's Wild Trout Program, which mandates that each year one\nlake and 25 miles of streams be identified as quality\ncatch-and-release fisheries. The DFG is behind in naming lakes to\nthe program, according to Alan Pickard, senior fisheries supervisor\nfor the DFG in Bishop.\n\n   Pickard said a zero-take limit is not likely to affect the\ngolden trout spawning project.\n\n   ``If it turns out there is a negative impact _ if after a few\nyears of angling we can't make our egg supplies, for example _ we\nwould take another look at the situation,'' Pickard said.\n\n   But for now its full steam ahead for golden fishing in the basin\nand as healthy as in times past, the biologist said.\n\n   Four years ago, Ridgecrest fisherman Crandell landed footlong\ngoldens in lake No.5. Largest and most distant of the Cottonwood\nquintet at 5.8 miles from the trailhead, it's the one lake that\nescaped the closure of 1966, when the DFG recommended the golden\ntrout spawning project be more stringently preserved. As in\nprevious years, it is also the only body from which goldens can be\nkept, with a limit of five.\n\n   ``It's a dream for him getting back up here,'' said Pat\nStrickland, a First Baptist Church of Ridgecrest pastor\naccompanying her friend.
