The 34-year-old former scrap metal dealer\nis a natural-born dreamer of big dreams.\n\n   He quit school to become a modern-day mountain man. And in the\nmountains, he found his fate when a grizzly bear charged. Or ambled\nover. Versions vary.\n\n   Anyway, since then, Hurtubise has chased a vision of the day\nwhen bear researchers, as he considers himself, can clump through\nthe grizzly-haunted wilds of the West in perfect safety, protected\nfrom fang and claw _ indeed, protected from anything short of\nnuclear blast _ in his soon-to-be-patented Ursus Mark VII\nanti-grizzly bear suit.\n\n   That would be the Genesis model, or ``G-Man,'' as he calls it.\nThe one with thermal night vision, a bite-meter on the arm to\nmeasure the power of the grizzly's chomp and even a black box to\nrecord the researcher's final shrieked ``field notes'' in the\nunhappy event of a systems failure during an attack.\n\n   ``If you're going to get down with grizzlies, you've got to have\ngear you can count on,'' says Hurtubise, a buckskin-clad inventor\nof the old school _ the school whose motto might be ``perseverance,\nimprovisation, duct tape.'' He used nearly 7,000 feet of the stuff\non the last prototype suit.\n\n   ``So you want to cover every possibility, even the possibilities\nyou don't want to think about,'' he says.\n\n   For 13 years now, Hurtubise has endured ridicule, rejection,\nfinancial ruin and domestic disharmony as the result of his\nobsessive quest to build the world's first effective anti-grizzly\narmor.\n\n   He's also routinely risked his life testing the suit, although\nvery little of the risk has come from actual bears. But more on\nthat later.\n\n   ``The objective of the suit is to achieve the protective\ncapability to conduct close-quarter research on the world's most\ndangerous land mammal,'' he says. ``But the G-Man also has\napplicability for bomb disposal, firefighting, UN peacekeeping,\npolice work and professional sports.''\n\n   For his efforts, Hurtubise has been mocked by Harvard, scorned\nby serious investors, and _ perhaps the unkindest cut _ made the\nsubject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary movie\nportraying him as a Quixotic nutcase.\n\n   But along the way, he's also become a sort of northlands folk\nhero.\n\n   ``There's something very Canadian about Troy and his suit, this\nattempt to keep savage nature at bay,'' said Peter Lynch, director\nof the quirky 1996 film, ``Project Grizzly,'' which Hollywood's\nQuentin Tarantino hailed as one of the finest documentaries ever\nmade.\n\n   Hurtubise himself has mixed feelings about the flick, which has\ngained something of a cult following, especially in Europe and\nJapan. On the plus side, it brought attention to his life's work.\nOn the negative side, it strongly suggested that his life's work is\nlunacy.\n\n   ``Science-wise, the film is garbage,'' he said. ``I mean you\ncome away thinking, `Here's this crazy guy, and he's kind of\npathetic.' But what gets left out is the science of what I'm trying\nto accomplish.''\n\n   So far, there have been six more or less functional prototypes\nof the bear suit, and Hurtubise is now working on the most advanced\ndesign, the Ursus Mark VII Genesis, or G-Man.\n\n   The particulars of the latest model are shrouded in secrecy\nsince he can't afford the costs of patenting a design that's ``10\nyears ahead of its time,'' he says. Having gone through more than\n$100,000 of his own money _ not to mention watching his scrap metal\nyard go bust while his wife, Lori, very nearly took that last walk\nout the door with their 7-year-old son, Brett _ Hurtubise is\ndesperate for financial backing.\n\n   ``This thing has good saleability, but I'm going to need $1.2\nmillion to get it off the ground,'' he says, stressing: ``Make sure\nyou say $1.2 million Canadian,'' or just a bit more than $800,000.\n\n   According to an article in New Scientist, a British publication,\nthe contrivance is made mostly of Boralyn E5 _ a lightweight metal\ncomposite produced by California's Alyn Corp. _ with a\n``honeycomb'' shock-absorbing system packed between the\nendoskeleton and exoskeleton. Hardly any duct tape.\n\n   ``This suit makes Robocop look like the Tin Man in `The Wizard\nof Oz,' '' Hurtubise says. ``With the G-Man, you can tap dance in a\nminefield. You can take a dynamite blast. You can take AK-47 rounds\nall day. You can walk through 4,000-degree Fahrenheit heat.\n\n   ``We're talking one tough suit.''\n\n   The G-Man's predecessor, the Mark VI, came to a sad end, seized\nby creditors _ although they were forgiving enough to let Hurtubise\nborrow it for a trip last fall to Harvard, where he accepted an\n``Ig-Nobel'' award in the field of safety engineering.\n\n   The annual awards are tongue-in-cheek Nobel opposites, bestowed\nfor ``research that cannot or should not be replicated.''\n\n   Hurtubise stole the show, happy to endure an evening of jibes,\njabs and guffaws from university slickers for the chance to stand\nbehind an honest-to-God Harvard lectern and speak passionately _ if\nsomewhat unintelligibly, given his strong up-north-Canada accent _\nabout the Genesis suit and its endless possibilities.\n\n   Possibilities such as live volcano exploration. Or riot control.\n\n   Even cynical souls were charmed by his earnestness.\n\n   ``OK, an anti-grizzly suit may not be what the world is waiting\nfor, but there really is something wonderful about Troy and his\nwork,'' said Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable\nResearch, the Cambridge-based journal that chooses the Ig-Nobel\nwinners. ``He's a classic inventor, just like Edison and a lot of\nothers who've been labeled crackpots.''\n\n   Hurtubise said: ``Sure, the award was a set-up: Let's all hoot\nat the bear suit guy. But, face it, for a researcher from North\nBay, Ontario, getting invited to Harvard for any damn reason is a\nreal breakthrough.''\n\n   Perhaps especially so for a 9th grade dropout who seemed\ndestined for a drifter's aimless life until one hot day in August\n1984.\n\n   Hurtubise, age 19, was panning for gold on Humidity Creek,\nBritish Columbia. Then, pounding down through a mountain meadow,\ncame an enormous speciman of Ursus arctos horribilis, the\n``horrible bear,'' or grizzly.\n\n   The bear knocked Hurtubise to the ground with a snout-shove to\nthe chest. Then padded off.\n\n   It was vaguely anti-climactic. Not getting torn apart or\ngobbled. But a great fascination was born.\n\n   ``It gave me a sense of mission. I wanted to study these\nawe-inspiring animals at close quarters,'' says Hurtubise.\n``Trouble is, I realized right away, if you hang out too close to\ngrizzlies, you can get killed.''\n\n   He went back to class, got that high school diploma. He\ncompleted courses in ``forest recreation technology'' at Ontario's\nSir Sanford Fleming College.\n\n   And he started working on the Ursus Mark I, the first of the\nbear suits.\n\n   Field tests conducted by Hurtubise swiftly became legend.\n\n   To test the awful forces of a bear mauling, for example, he'd\nenlist a few local biker types, stoke their empirical instincts\nwith beer, provide blunt instruments _ planks, baseball bats, axe\nhandles _ clamber inside the anti-bear armor as their boisterous\nspirits rose. Then he would give his colleagues in science the\nthumbs up. Or chainmail mitts up.
