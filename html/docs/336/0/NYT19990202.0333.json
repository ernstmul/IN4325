(sw) \n By DENISE GRADY   \n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   \n\n   Certain antibiotics may reduce the risk of heart attack,\nresearchers are reporting Wednesday in a study that adds to a\ngrowing body of evidence suggesting that chronic infections may\nplay a role in artery disease, heart attacks and strokes.\n\n   But researchers said it was premature to recommend that people\ntake antibiotics to prevent heart attacks because infections had\nnot been proved to cause heart disease. And the overuse of\nantibiotics has already helped to create dangerous strains of\ndrug-resistant bacteria that are exceedingly hard to kill.\n\n   The latest finding comes from researchers at Boston University\nMedical Center, who compared the medical records of 3,315 people\nwho had suffered heart attacks and 13,139 who had not. Those with\nhealthy hearts were more likely to have taken certain antibiotics:\ntetracycline, which lowered the risk of heart attack by 30 percent,\nor quinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Enoxacin and other drugs), which\ndecreased the risk by 55 percent. Other antibiotics did not reduce\nrisk.\n\n   The drugs that did make a difference were especially effective\nagainst the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, a common microbe that\ninfects the respiratory tract and that many other studies have\nlinked to heart disease. It can cause pneumonia, bronchitis and\nsinus infections, but can also linger in the body without producing\nany symptoms at all. It is related to other types of Chlamydial\nbacteria that infect the eyes and reproductive system.\n\n   But the researchers, whose work is being published on Wednesday\nin the Journal of the American Medical Association, stressed that\nwhile the study showed that the drugs were associated with\ndecreased risk of heart disease, it did not prove that the drugs\ncaused the lowering of risk. Dr. Herschel Jick, an associate\nprofessor of medicine at Boston University Medical Center in\nLexington, Mass., and leader of the study, warned that people\nshould not start taking antibiotics to ward off heart attacks.\n``It's far from proof,'' he said.\n\n   Similarly, other research has found evidence of Chlamydia\npneumoniae infection in people with heart disease and in tissue\nfrom diseased arteries, but scientists have not determined whether\nthe organisms actually cause the disease or just live as ``innocent\nbystanders'' in the damaged blood vessels.\n\n   Dr. Aaron Folsom, a professor of epidemiology at the University\nof Minnesota in Minneapolis who wrote an editorial accompanying the\narticle, cautioned against acting prematurely on Wednesday's\nfindings.\n\n   ``At this point there's no reason for anybody to be given\nantibiotics to prevent coronary heart disease,'' Folsom said in a\ntelephone interview. ``I'm not convinced any of this is going to\npan out.''\n\n   Even if it did, he said, he would be concerned that expanding\nthe use of antibiotics to millions of people at risk for heart\ndisease might contribute to the development of drug-resistant\nbacteria.\n\n   Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration have been\nespecially worried about the overuse of quinolones because those\ndrugs are a relatively new class of antibiotic, and if widespread\nresistance to them develops, alternatives might be limited, said\nDr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine\nand organizer of a recent FDA conference on the problem of\ndrug-resistant bacteria.\n\n   In response to Wednesday's study, the American Heart Association\nissued a statement in which its president, Dr. Valentin Fuster,\nsaid it was ``much too early to consider prescribing antibiotics to\npeople at risk for heart attack.''\n\n   But in a telephone interview, Fuster, who is director of the\ncardiovascular institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in\nNew York, said some doctors were already prescribing antibiotics\nfor patients with heart disease. Other researchers also said\ncolleagues were prescribing the drugs despite the lack of proof.\n\n   Wednesday's finding that drugs that kill bacteria may also\nprotect the heart supports an idea that has begun to captivate some\nscientists: that certain bacterial infections may linger in the\nbody for months or years, eating away at the artery walls, causing\ninflammation and helping to create lesions and blockages. If that\nis the case, the theory goes, eliminating the infection may help\nthe lesions to heal, or at least keep them from progressing to the\npoint of causing a heart attack or stroke.\n\n   But the theory represents a departure from medical orthodoxy.\nMainstream research on cardiovascular disease has focused on risk\nfactors like dietary fat, smoking, high blood pressure and lack of\nexercise. If infection does turn out to play a role, it will not\nsupplant those other risk factors, researchers say, but will just\nbe added to the list.\n\n   Jick and his colleagues set out to test the idea in a large\ngroup they had already studied extensively: three million people in\nBritain whose medical records are stored in a computerized data\nbase. To determine whether infection contributes to heart attack,\nthey identified people who had had heart attacks even though they\nlacked the usual risk factors, and compared each patient to four\nother control subjects with similar histories but no heart attacks.\n\n   The finding that the healthy people had used more antibiotics\nsuggested that infection might be involved in heart disease, the\nresearchers said. They also said the difference between the two\ngroups was not due to differences in their use of aspirin, which\ncan help prevent heart attacks.\n\n   But they said more research was needed to verify the findings.\nFor one thing, only 8 heart attack victims and 62 control subjects\ntook quinolones, a small number to base conclusions on.
