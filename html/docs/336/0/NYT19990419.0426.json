The episode was first documented\nlast week at NATO when alliance officials took the unusual step of\nplaying a taped interview with one of these F-16 pilots.\n\n   A F-16 pilots in ``Bear 21'' saw people running from a house\nthat burst into flames and jumping onto a vehicle, which NATO\nofficials said may have been a tractor. Believing that they had set\nthe house on fire, he attacked the vehicle with a laser-guided\nbomb, destroying it.\n\n   Another bomb was later dropped north of the town in an attack by\na different group of F-16s. Serb television later showed destroyed\ntractors at that site, raising the possibility of civilian\ncasualties.\n\n   NATO's principal disclosure, however, was of the attack later in\nthe day south of the town on a large convoy of more than 100\nvehicles. That raid involved several sets of aircraft, including\nF-16s, French Jaguars, OA-10 observers, as well as a flying\nairborne command and control aircraft.\n\n   Another important link was NATO's command center in Vicenza,\nItaly _ known at the Combined Air Operations Center- which is\ncoordinating the air campaign.\n\n   The raids on this column began when two F-16s, code-named ``Bear\n31,'' saw the convoy. From the start, the F-16 pilots were worried\nabout the possibility of civilian casualties. With many villages\naflame, there was reason to think that many refugees might be on\nthe road.\n\n   Leaf said the pilots in ``Bear 31'' had an ``extensive\ndiscussion'' with the ABCCC command plane about whether the convoy\nwas a civilian or military target. It was not easy for the pilots\nto identify the vehicles from the high altitude they generally fly\nat to avoid Serbian anti-aircraft artillery.\n\n   And while F-16s incorporate advanced military technology, these\nsystems have their limits. Potential targets are shown in the F-16\ncockpit on a special display, which is about 4.5 inches wide and\n4.5 inches long.

He cannot use binoculars because the\ncockpit is too small, a military official said.\n\n   As was the case of the ``Bear 21'' F-16 patrol north of\nDjakovica, the ``Bear 31'' F-16s were flying air controllers, whose\nmission was not only to carry out strikes but to coordinate attacks\nby other allied planes.\n\n   Despite worries about refugees on the road, a number of factors\nled ``Bear 31'' to conclude they were observing a military column.\nThe 20 or so vehicles at the front appeared to be traveling in\nformation, with a set distance between them. They were moving\nquickly, leading the pilots to believe they were not tractors.\n\n   Further, the ABCCC command and control alerted the planes that\nthe convoy was made up of Yugoslav military vehicles.\n\n   The two F-16s attacked the convoy, destroying one vehicle. They\ncalled in strikes by two French Jacquar planes, which missed the\nconvoy.\n\n   The F-16s ran low on fuel and were replaced by another pair of\nF-16 planes, codenamed ``Bear 41,'' which came under Serb\nanti-aircraft fire.\n\n   Suddenly, there was an ominous warning. After twenty minutes of\nbombing against the convoy, the command center in Italy wanted the\nplanes to check the targets again and make sure that they were\nmilitary.\n\n   Military intelligence experts at the command center were dubious\nthat Serbian forces would be driving down an open road in such a\nlong convoy. They had been hiding and hunkering down for weeks.\n\n   To get a better look ``Bear 41'' asked for help from a pair of\nOA-10s, code-named ``Cub,'' which had been flying over eastern\nKosovo. The plane is slower and its pilot use binoculars to pick\nout targets.\n\n   The OA-10s reported that military vehicles had been struck, but\nthat civilian vehicles also seemed to be present.
