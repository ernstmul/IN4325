Times News Service   \n\n   Despite the DOA nature of the genre it satirizes, the demon\ncrocodile movie ``Lake Placid'' finds a good deal to work with in\nnewly reptile-plagued Maine. As written by David E. Kelley with\ntongue firmly in cheek, it provides a good cast with the challenge\nof keeping straight faces.\n\n   So Bridget Fonda plays the tick-hating paleontologist who is\nsent from a New York museum to investigate a strange, recently\ndiscovered artifact. (``You want me to go to Maine to look at a\ntooth?'') And the splendid Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, star of\n``The General,'' affects the accent to play the local sheriff who\ngreets her.\n\n   ``They wanted to call it Lake Placid,'' he says, while giving\nher a tour, ``but somebody said that name was taken.'' Well, no\nmatter. This is a movie that begins with a swimmer suddenly savaged\nby an underwater monster (while the sheriff eats a Twinkie), and\n``Jaws'' was taken, too.\n\n   The tooth turns out to be prehistoric. (``Evidently it's\nnothing,'' some sage decides.) Still, on the chance that it may\nlead to a 30-foot-long, tail-snapping brute designed by Stan\nWinston, a group of usual suspects gathers at the lake.\n\n   Bill Pullman is on hand as the obligatory stern local hunk. And\nOliver Platt turns up as the wisecracking eccentric mythology\nprofessor, of whom it is said reverently: ``He also treks the world\nto _ to swim with crocodiles.''\n\n   While making his flamboyant entrance, his character looks at Ms.\nFonda and exclaims, ``Oh, the earth is round, and so should you\nbe!'' Later on he manages to bring up Ancient Melanesia while\ndiscussing crocodile lore.\n\n   The dialogue can be delicious. (Pullman: ``Any recent bear\nattacks?'' Gleeson: ``This was no bear. Bears don't attack people\nunderwater.'') And the horror effects can be divinely cheesy, like\nthe presumed underwater sprinkler hose whose churning effect is\ndescribed as ``scared perch.''\n\n   Trouble is, while not trading quips, the characters actually go\nthrough the motions of being scared of the croc, menaced by the\ncroc and so on. And since even the gator horror satire is old hat\n(remember ``Alligator?''), there's no remaining way to make this\ninteresting. It doesn't help that the director, Steve Miner, makes\nmurky underwater shots in the Maine lake suggest the New York City\nsewer system.\n\n   There's some moderate gore here, most of it jokey. (``Is this\nthe man who was killed?'' Platt asks, wielding a severed toe.\nGleeson replies, ``He looked taller.'') And there's also Betty\nWhite on hand to play the crocodile's best human friend. Her\ncharacter's foul-mouthed dialogue is funny for its incongruity,\nless so for its real purpose.\n\n   ``Lake Placid'' could easily have been made as a PG-13 movie, or\nperhaps even a PG. But the better to tempt teen-age audiences, it\ntalks its way into an R.\n\n   PRODUCTION NOTES:  \n\n   `LAKE PLACID'\n\n   Directed by Steve Miner; written by David E.
