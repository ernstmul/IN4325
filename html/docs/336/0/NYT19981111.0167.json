Ferries began its ``Lost Coast'' service from Port\nHardy to Bella Coola, hundreds of American kayakers have\nexperienced the fjords, waterfalls and bears of British Columbia's\ncentral coast.\n\n   This fiercely beautiful place has become the center of a fierce\npolitical struggle, which has spurred publication of ``The Great\nBear Rainforest: Canada's Forgotten Coast'' by Ian & Karen\nMcAllister.\n\n   Using the expansive exhibit format, the McAllisters detail their\nexplorations of 80 virtually untouched watersheds along the wild\ncoast and their enchantment with the grizzly bears and wolves with\nwhich they have kept company.\n\n   The book is a gorgeous and effective piece of propaganda. Many\nof the pristine valleys are scheduled for logging in the next few\nyears. Having preserved some critical areas, the British Columbia\ngovernment has sided with the forest products industry on opening\nthe rest to road building and chainsaws. B.C. Premier Glen Clark\nmade headlines last year by referring to Greenpeace protesters as\n``enemies of British Columbia.''\n\n   Exaggeration is a fundamental tool of the conservation movement,\nand much is on display here.\n\n   ``If we ever had country like that in the United States, we've\nlong since destroyed it with failed forestry practices,'' New York\nenvironmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. writes in the book's\nforward.\n\n   Wrong! Just north of British Columbia, giant tracts of Alaska\nrain forest have been protected in the Misty Fjords and Admiralty\nIsland national monuments.\n\n   RFK Jr. goes on to talk about British Columbia setting aside\nonly ``small tracts'' as parks. Kennedy ignores the 850,000-acre\nKitlope Heritage Conservancy Protected Area, touted by\nconservationists in the early 1990s as the largest undisturbed\ntract of temperate rain forest on Earth. Once a place gets saved,\nthe environmental movement seemingly forgets about it.\n\n   Once the McAllisters get out in their trimaran, however, the\nbook gains credibility. They make a compelling case that the\ncoastline has been callously exploited. For instance, more than 3\nmillion sockeye salmon used to return to Rivers Inlet and\nwatersheds around Owikeno Lake. After nearly 30 years of\nclear-cutting and inattentive fisheries management offshore, the\nruns have declined to 65,000.\n\n   The McAllisters find a wolf den with ``a little mound of grey\npups'' in the still-wild Takush Valley off Smith Inlet. A dynamite\nblast shatters the silence. International Forest Products is\nbuilding a road and soon will be logging the Takush. Interfor is\nthe same company whose shore-to-summit clear-cuts at Kyuquot Sound\non Vancouver Island were pictured in a National Geographic spread\nthat should be seen by all connoisseurs of ugliness.\n\n   The authors are at their best photographing and writing about\ngrizzly bears. Convinced that grizzlies can sense when a human\nintruder is dangerous, the McAllisters have gone gently into their\nhabitat. The result is a close-up look at one of the world's great\npredators.\n\n   Despite its agility and ferocity, ursus horribilis is vulnerable\nto man and has been driven from the vast bulk of its habitat in\nNorth America. One of the few hospitable places grizzlies have left\nis the British Columbia coast.\n\n   But grizzlies fishing for salmon are easy prey for hunters. The\nMcAllisters stumble on an illegal hunting blind in Fiordland\nRecreation Area, as well as the skeletal remains of an illegally\nkilled female grizzly. The British Columbia government has no\nreliable population figures, but it permits trophy hunting to\ncontinue. The book accurately conveys a sense of lax regulation and\nenforcement, and points to a poaching problem that the province is\nloathe to admit.\n\n   ``The Great Bear Rainforest'' has one great weakness: Its\nauthors seem to have little contact with and little interest in\ntwo-legged inhabitants of the wild coast.
