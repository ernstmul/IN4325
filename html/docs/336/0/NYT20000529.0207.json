Times News Service    \n\n   From any perspective, the remote, rugged country surrounding the\nBitterroot Mountains in western Montana and central Idaho appears\nideal for grizzly bears. Here are the types of terrain grizzlies\nlove: alpine meadows; pine, cedar and fir forests; glacial lakes\nand fast-running streams flowing into lush river valleys.\n\n   Although salmon have declined sharply, the roots, berries, nuts,\nelk, deer and insects the giants need to fuel their six-month\nhibernation abound. Indeed, hundreds of the big bears that the Nez\nPerce tribe called xaxat roamed this area when Lewis and Clark\npassed through in 1806, killing seven. In the next decades,\nhundreds of grizzlies fell to hunters, with the last recorded kill\nin 1932. Despite several exhaustive surveys, no one has seen a\ngrizzly bear in this region for more than half a century.\n\n   That situation is about to change. This summer, the U.S. Fish\nand Wildlife Service is expected to adopt a controversial plan to\nput grizzly bears back in the Bitterroot region. A 15-member\ncitizen management committee will be charged with finding a way for\nthe bears to flourish and coexist with humans, particularly those\nengaged in backcountry recreation, logging, mining and ranching.\n\n   If threatened congressional and legal challenges from Idaho do\nnot delay the plan from being carried out, the management committee\nwill complete preparations for the arrival of the first bears in\n2002, said Dr. Christopher Servheen, grizzly bear recovery\ncoordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, based in Missoula,\nMont. Over five years, at least 25 bears will be released in the\nBitterroots. Because of the grizzly's slow reproductive rate, it\nwill take 50 to 110 years for the population to reach the project's\ngoal of 280 bears.\n\n   Servheen said the reintroduction was an essential step in\nensuring the long-term survival of the grizzly in the lower 48\nstates and its removal from the endangered species list, where it\nhas been designated as ``threatened'' since 1975.\n\n   Like the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park and these\nsame Bitterroots in 1995 and 1996, the grizzlies will be relocated\nas a ``nonessential experimental population'' under the Endangered\nSpecies Act. That designation makes it easier to remove bears that\ncome into conflict with people or fail to thrive. It also allows\nofficials to suspend habitat protections that ordinarily apply to\nendangered species, thereby giving them greater flexibility in\ndealing with land-use conflicts.\n\n   ``We know enough about the biology of bears to manage them,''\nServheen said. ``The limiting factor is the behavior of people. We\nhave to strike a balance between the needs of bears and the needs\nof people.'' Finding that balance is the task of the citizen\nmanagement committee, appointed by the secretary of the interior,\nand made up of local people from Montana and Idaho, the Nez Perce\ntribe, the National Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife\nService.\n\n   North America's largest carnivore, the grizzly bear is a figure\nof legendary might. A subspecies of the brown bear named for its\nsilver-tipped guard hairs, which appeared ``grizzly'' to early\nexplorers, it stands up to 7-feet tall and weighs 300 to 600\npounds, with some reaching 800 pounds. Highly protective of their\nfood and young, aggressive in response to surprises, and solitary\nby habit, the big bears are often considered dangerously\nantisocial.\n\n   Grizzly bears are relatively abundant in parts of Canada and\nAlaska, but in the western United States, where Servheen estimates\nthat 50,000 roamed at the time of Lewis and Clark's expedition,\nthey number fewer than 1,000 and occupy only about 2 percent of\ntheir original range. The remaining bears are largely concentrated\nin and around Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park and\nthe Bob Marshall Wilderness.\n\n   Wildlife biologists have long recommended establishing another\npopulation of bears in the Bitterroot region to lessen the risk of\nextinction and ultimately provide a vital genetic link between the\ngeographically isolated grizzlies in Yellowstone and those farther\nnorth. The grizzlies are also expected to improve the health of the\nBitterroot ecosystem. The region contains the largest expanse of\ncontiguous federal lands in the lower 48 states, covering some\n26,000 square miles, and includes two vast roadless areas, the\nFrank Church River of No Return Wilderness and the\nSelway-Bitterroot Wilderness, which are considered ideal for\ngrizzly bears, whose home territory can reach 500 square miles.\n\n   Bears for the reintroduction will be taken from Yellowstone\nNational Park, Glacier National Park and Canada. The bears are\nexpected to adjust without much difficulty, unless they run afoul\nof humans; 79 percent of grizzlies that die prematurely do so at\nthe hands of humans, said Dr. David Mattson, a wildlife biologist\nwith the United States Geological Survey's Biological Resources\nDivision in Flagstaff, Ariz.\n\n   Many opponents of the reintroduction plan fear grizzly attacks,\na possibility that most bear biologists consider remote, especially\nin the first years of the project. Dr. Stephen Herrero, an emeritus\nprofessor of environmental science at the University of Calgary and\na leading expert on bear attacks, said, ``There are 700,000 black\nbears and 70,000 grizzly bears in North America and on average they\nkill three people a year and injure a dozen to two dozen. People\nfear these animals because they can be violent and cause injury or\ndeath, but once people know about bears, they can respect them and\nlive with them without danger.''\n\n   All the reintroduced bears will be equipped with radio collars\nso that wildlife biologists can monitor their health and movements,\nServheen said. The citizen management committee and wildlife\nofficials will also work to allay people's fear of bears and to\nprevent the sorts of situations and conflicts that lead to the\ndeaths of bears or people.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n     \nnn\n\n   Establishment of the citizen management committee represents a\ntriumph for a coalition consisting of the Resource Organization on\nTimber Supply, a group of timber companies and unions with\nheadquarters in Lewiston, Idaho; the Intermountain Forest Industry\nAssociation, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; the National Wildlife\nFederation; and Defenders of Wildlife. In 1995, that coalition\npresented the concept to Servheen and the grizzly bear recovery\nteam as a way to allow logging, recreation and other activities to\ncontinue in the company of bears.\n\n   The Fish and Wildlife Service embraced the idea, which was\nhailed nationally as a sign that a new spirit of cooperation was\ntaking hold in the West after years of bitter conflict over land\nuse and the Endangered Species Act. Despite a poll showing that a\nvast majority of people regionally and nationally wanted grizzlies,\nthe plan was immediately caught in the sort of fierce political\nstruggle it was intended to prevent.\n\n   A number of environmental groups oppose the plan, and have\nproposed an alternative plan for the grizzlies. ``This plan is not\nthe best we could do for bears,'' said Mike Bader, executive\ndirector of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, which is based in\nMissoula, Mont. He said the plan went too far in accommodating the\ntimber industry and not far enough in protecting grizzly bears and\ntheir habitat.\n\n   Anti-bear groups and a majority of the region's political\nleaders complain that because the grizzly is not at immediate risk\nof extinction, the federal government is needlessly unloosing a\npredator that is a threat to humans. They also contend that because\nthe citizen management committee must report to the secretary of\nthe interior, who has legal authority for endangered species, the\nplan does not cede enough control to state and local officials.\n\n   The Idaho congressional delegation has worked for several years\nto block the reintroduction, and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has publicly\nthreatened to file suit to stop it.\n\n   Bill Mulligan, president of Three Rivers Timber Inc., of Kamiah,\nIdaho, and co-chairman of the Resource Organization on Timber\nSupply, said that anger over the Clinton administration's roadless\nplan for national forests and proposals to restore the salmon and\nsteelhead trout runs on the Snake River had stirred anti-government\nsentiment. People have directed their anger and alienation over\nthose issues at the timber industry and the union groups backing\nthe grizzly reintroduction, making it difficult for them to rally\nsupport. ``We get beat up pretty bad at public hearings on\ngrizzlies,'' Mulligan said. ``But we made a deal with the best of\nintentions and so we have stuck to it.''\n\n   Alone among prominent officials in Montana and Idaho, Gov.
