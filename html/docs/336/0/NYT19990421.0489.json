Times News Service   \n\n   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When NATO struck hard at Yugoslavia's\npolitical and media elite early Wednesday morning, it sent a clear\nmessage that after weeks of hesitation, the alliance would now hit\nthe business interests of President Slobodan Milosevic's family and\nfriends.\n\n   The three cruise missiles that set a 23-story building aflame\nknocked three television stations off the air and destroyed the\noffices of the political parties of Milosevic and his wife.\n\n   It was NATO's first attack on the Yugoslav mass media in\nBelgrade. The main state network, Radio and Television of Serbia,\nwas not hit and remained on the air.\n\n   The building, formerly the Central Committee of the Yugoslav\nCommunist Party, contains the offices of Milosevic's Serbian\nSocialist Party; the offices of the Yugoslav United Left party of\nhis wife, Mirjana Markovic; the studios and transmitters of radio\nand TV Kosava, or Wind, which belongs to their daughter, Marija;\nthe studios and transmitters of TV Pink, which belongs to a family\nfriend, Zeljko Mitrovic, a prominent member of Yugoslav Left; the\nstudio and transmitter of the main sports channel, SOS, and the\nmain transmitter of BK TV, which owned by four brothers named\nKaric, one of whom, Bogoljub, is a Yugoslav Left minister without\nportfolio in the Serbian government.\n\n   All the stations were knocked off the air, except for the\nentertainment channel, Pink, which can be seen in one area of\nBelgrade because Mitrovic also has a small transmitter on the roof\nof his house in the elite residential and diplomatic area of\nDedinje. Late Wednesday evening, BK was back on the air in\nBelgrade, although with a weak and blurry picture.\n\n   An attack on the northern city of Novi Sad hit transmitters that\nleft the city of 400,000 without any television reception at all,\nincluding the channels of state television.\n\n   The last of Novi Sad's three bridges over the Danube was also\nbadly damaged, closing it to road and rail traffic. While the\nZezeljev bridge still stands, it is safe only for pedestrians now,\nofficials said. On Wednesday afternoon, NATO bombed a railway\nbridge nine miles west of Belgrade.\n\n   At a news conference in Belgrade on Wednesday, Robert Nemecek, a\nprogram director for Pink, bemoaned the loss, in the conflagration,\nof 123 episodes of ``The Simpsons'' and new episodes of ``Chicago\nHope'' and ``Friends.'' ``It is all burned,'' he said sadly.\n\n   NATO officials said Wednesday that the building was a military\ntarget, because it was part of a link in the city's coordinated air\ndefense system of radars and communication. But few here took the\nNATO disclaimer at face value.\n\n   The Serbian prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, condemned the\nattack as having no military purpose. ``This is yet more evidence\nthat the criminals target civilians,'' he said.\n\n   A senior Serbian journalist said: ``I'm now a lost cause for\ntheir propaganda messages. All I can think of is that they just\nkilled some poor people who were on the night shift.''\n\n   While there were no official reports of casualties, local\njournalists said that at least 15 people had been working in the\nbuilding at about 3:15 a.m. when the first missile hit.\n\n   In an interview with BBC World Television, the Yugoslav deputy\nprime minister, Vuk Draskovic, a relative liberal, said again\nWednesday that the official news media were ``hiding'' casualty\nfigures and ``I don't know why.'' He said, also vaguely, that ``a\nfew thousand people, almost all of them civilians, are killed or\ninjured'' in NATO's attacks.\n\n   But the spokesman for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, Nebojsa\nVujovic, has said on the record that more than 300 civilians have\nbeen killed and up to 3,000 wounded since the NATO attacks began.\n\n   Serbs here also say that NATO is dropping Serbian-language\npropaganda leaflets in larger numbers. Oddly, a leaflet dropped\nlast week, which advertised radio and television frequencies on\nwhich NATO information might be heard, included the frequencies for\nRadio Kosava (102.2), which was not off the air until Wednesday\nmorning, and for B-92 (92.5), which has been taken over by the\ngovernment but remains on the air.\n\n   Other frequencies listed, under the NATO logo and the headline\n``We want to speak with you,'' include 106.4 and 1003 medium wave,\nas well as television channel 21. NATO has been flying radio and TV\ntransmitter planes over Yugoslavia, but few Yugoslavs have seen or\nheard the relatively weak transmissions.\n\n   Another leaflet attempts to describe events in Kosovo, saying:\n``For the last week Serb armies and police, under direct orders of\nSlobodan Milosevic, have emptied the villages and towns of Kosovo''\nand ``burned or destroyed thousands of houses.''\n\n   The leaflet asserts that ``heads of families were torn away from\ntheir wives and kids and killed'' in what it calls, in boldface,\n``Milosevic's pogrom.'' It continues, ``There is a fear that\nthousands of innocent people have been killed.''\n\n   It concludes, in boldface, ``Do not allow misguided patriotism\nto connect you to his misdeeds,'' and then ends with a sort of\nadvertising slogan: ``NATO defends the defenseless.''\n\n   The leaflet fails to mention the fundamental NATO demand, which\nMilosevic has firmly rejected, that Kosovo be occupied by an\ninternational security force with a core of armed NATO troops. Most\nSerbs interviewed strongly oppose an armed foreign force in Kosovo.\n\n   The effectiveness of such propaganda leaflets, which remind many\neducated Serbs of the leafletting efforts of the Nazis in World War\nII, is impossible to know. Many Serbs in larger cities have access\nto Western satellite television in any event.\n\n   Many of those interviewed over the last month who have such\naccess, or access to the Internet, nonetheless regard Western\nassertions of Nazi-like atrocities as exaggerated and hyperbolic.\nThe more damage NATO does to ordinary Serbs on behalf of the ethnic\nAlbanians, one senior Serbian journalist said, ``the less people\nworry very much about them.''\n\n   Another Serbian journalist said, ``There's a feeling that we're\nall collateral damage now.''\n","Headline":"\n23.)  \n NATO'S ATTACK ON MEDIA SENDS MESSAGE TO MILOSEVIC \n","Text":["\n   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When NATO struck hard at Yugoslavia's\npolitical and media elite early Wednesday morning, it sent a clear\nmessage that after weeks of hesitation, the alliance would now hit\nthe business interests of President Slobodan Milosevic's family and\nfriends.\n","\n   The three cruise missiles that set a 23-story building aflame\nknocked three television stations off the air and destroyed the\noffices of the political parties of Milosevic and his wife.\n","\n   It was NATO's first attack on the Yugoslav mass media in\nBelgrade.
