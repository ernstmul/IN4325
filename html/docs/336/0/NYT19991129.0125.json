The Chinese people see round faces as\nbeautiful.\n\n   PANDA FACTS\n\n   Scientific name: Ailaropada melanoleuca.\n\n   We've been around for years: Our species has existed since the\nPleistocene Era, about 600,000 years ago. But now we're dying out:\nWe don't breed well in captivity. There are about 110 to 120 of us\nin captivity, mostly in China. Only three zoos in the United States\nexhibit giant pandas: the San Diego Zoo; the National Zoo in\nWashington, D.C.; and, of course, Zoo Atlanta.\n\n   We'll get bigger: As adults, our species grows to be 4 to 6 feet\nlong and may weigh up to 350 pounds.\n\n   Growing old together: In the wild, pandas usually live 16 to 18\nyears. In captivity, the average life expectancy is about 30 years.\n\n   Where you'll find our friends: In the wild, we are found only in\nthe mountains of central China. We live in dense bamboo and\nconiferous forests at altitudes of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The\nmountains are shrouded in thick clouds, with rain throughout the\nyear.\n\n   We like fiber in our diets: We live almost completely on bamboo,\nand eat up to 40 pounds of it a day. We also eat irises, crocuses,\nfish and occasionally small rodents. We can eat for as much as 16\nhours of our day.\n\n   Hometown bamboo: We didn't like the bamboo grown in Savannah,\nGa., so now we're munching on bamboo grown in the Atlanta area.\n\n   Very hard to have babies: We reach sexual maturity between 4 and\n6 years of age. Female pandas are in heat for only one to three\nweeks of the year, usually between March and May.\n\n   Lucky to survive: Our litters range from one to three cubs, but\nusually only one survives.\n\n   We're not like Yogi Bear: Unlike other bears, we do not\nhibernate and cannot walk on our hind legs.\n\n   Source: Zoo Atlanta\n\n   A few weeks ago, we asked you to call us with questions you\nwanted answered about the pandas. Here are some of those questions\nand the answers we learned from the zoo experts:\n\n   Q: Why are giant pandas black and white?\n\n   A: No one knows. Perhaps their coloration provides camouflage in\ntheir forest habitats. There is a Chinese fable about a young girl\nwho loved pandas. When hunters came to shoot the pandas, she jumped\nin front of them and was killed. The pandas expressed their grief\nby rubbing their arms and legs with ashes. Their eyes became black\nwhen they wiped away their tears, and their shoulders became black\nas they hugged to console each other.\n\n   Q: Could scientists clone them?\n\n   A: It might be possible to clone pandas, but because essential\nsocial skills are acquired during the time infants spend with their\nmothers, it would not be a very successful way of saving the\nspecies.\n\n   Q: Do they mate for life?\n\n   A: No, bears do not mate for life. Both females and males may\nhave several mates during their lives.\n\n   Q: Will people speak to them in Chinese even though they're in\nAtlanta?\n\n   A: Like other animals, they learn certain words and gestures\nfrom their human keepers. Lun Lun and Yang Yang will have to get\nused to hearing American voices speaking English. Fortunately, they\nare very young and they seem to be very smart. They also have two\nof their familiar human friends from China who will stay with them\nfor six months to help them make the transition.\n\n   Q: Do they have the same organs as humans?\n\n   A: All mammals, including humans and bears, have the same basic\norgans, such as hearts, lungs, stomachs, livers and kidneys.\n\n   Q: Are pandas gentle or would they maul a person if they could?\n\n   A: Pandas have big sharp teeth and claws. They could hurt a\nperson if they felt threatened, but they are very gentle most of\nthe time.\n\n   Q: Are they bears or raccoons?\n\n   A: For many years, scientists have debated whether pandas should\nbe classified as bears, raccoons, or a separate family all their\nown. This debate is because the giant panda and its cousin, the\nlesser or red panda, share many characteristics with both bears and\nraccoons. Recent DNA analysis indicates that giant pandas are more\nclosely related to bears, and red pandas are more closely related\nto raccoons. Accordingly, giant pandas are now categorized in the\nbear family while red pandas are categorized in the raccoon family.\nYou can visit both giant pandas and red pandas at Zoo Atlanta.\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   ATLANTA _ The giant pandas are finally on exhibit at Zoo\nAtlanta.
