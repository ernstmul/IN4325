Scott noted that bear\npopulations in the Kootenays are already under pressure from\nroad-building, clearcut logging, mining, pipelines and powerlines.\n\n   ``The extent of habitat loss in that area is extreme. We are\ntalking about some of the most endangered bears in all of North\nAmerica,'' Scott said. ``It's critical that we first have a\npopulation count, a direct head count.''\n\n   The plan is to release five grizzlies annually into remoter\nparts of the Selway-Bitterroot country between next year and 2006.\nAn initial ``seeding'' stock of 25 bears _ half taken from British\nColumbia, half from elsewhere in the United States _ should grow to\nmaximum of 280 grizzlies. The slow-breeding species could take a\nhalf-century or more to reach this population level.\n\n   The transplanting of species from Canada to the United States\nhas racked up at least one spectacular success.\n\n   Almost 70 years after hunters and trappers exterminated canis\nlupus from Yellowstone National Park, 14 wolves from Alberta were\nreleased in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National\nPark Service. An additional 17 wolves were let loose the following\nyear.\n\n   Since then, they have multiplied to an estimated 160 wolves _\nincluding one pack frequently seen by visitors to the Lamar Valley\nin the northeast corner of the park.\n\n   This year, 30 Canadian lynx from northern British Columbia and\nthe Yukon were set loose in the Colorado Rockies, another effort to\nbring back a species that has become endangered in the United\nStates.\n\n   Ambitious conservation activists in both the United States and\nCanada have dreamed of going much further. They want to create an\nunbroken wildlife corridor stretching 1,700 miles from the Yukon to\nYellowstone.\n\n   The ``Y-to-Y'' corridor would require limiting such human\nincursions as oil and gas exploration, and closing hundreds of\nmiles of logging roads.\n\n   Two centuries ago, grizzly bears needed no corridors. An\nestimated 50,000 grizzlies roamed the American West from the Great\nPlains to the Sierra Nevada.\n\n   Nowadays, however, only about 1,000 survive in the United\nStates, outside of Alaska. Most are found in two pockets, one\ncentered on Yellowstone National Park and adjoining wilderness\nareas, the other Montana's Glacier National Park.\n\n   The Selway-Bitterroot wilderness, stretching over more than 2\nmillion acres in north-central Idaho and crossing the Continental\nDivide into Montana, is historic grizzly habitat, but the last of\nits grizzlies was shot by a hunter in the mid-1940s. Uninhabited by\npeople, with no major highways, it has been proclaimed by bear\nbiologists as ideal habitat for an animal that ranges over 30 to 50\nsquare miles.\n\n   Some Idaho politicians and ranchers in surrounding counties\naren't happy about the prospect of reintroducing grizzlies.\n\n   Custer County, Idaho, commissioners have passed a resolution\n``authorizing'' the shooting of any grizzlies restored to the\nregion. The bears, however, are protected by federal law.\n\n   One voice of opposition comes from a politician who has long\ncampaigned to save critical wildlife habitat.\n\n   Former Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus has pointed out that the\ngrizzlies will need a food supply. Historically, the bears ate\nsalmon from tributary streams of the Snake River. Since\nconstruction of four downstream dams, however, salmon have\nvirtually disappeared from even the wildest tributaries.\n\n   With no more salmon, Andrus fears, grizzles will chase away\nother predators like cougars and black bears, and then come out of\nthe wilderness to take cattle and sheep.\n\n   ``Humans bent on restoration of species will be making a mistake\nif they act with the same heavy hand as the exterminators did early\nin this century,'' Andrus, who served as Interior Secretary in the\nCarter administration, wrote in his 1998 memoirs.\n\n   That view is disputed by Bruce McLellan, a bear biologist with\nthe British Columbia ministry of forests in Revelstoke.\n\n   ``The Selway-Bitterroot isn't unique,'' McLellan said. ``Where I\nlive on the Columbia River, we used to have salmon. We have no more\nsalmon but we have many grizzly bears.''\n\n   (The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930s shut off more\nthan 1,100 miles of salmon spawning habitat in the upper reaches of\nthe Columbia river system.)\n\n   A Fish and Wildlife Service plan estimates that a fully\nrecovered bear population would kill about six cattle and 25 sheep\neach year. Under the plan, ranchers in areas near the wilderness\ncould obtain a special permit to kill grizzlies that have attacked\ntheir livestock.\n\n   Even with hostile ranchers nearbly, grizzlies transplanted to\nthe Selway-Bitterroot likely would find a better chance of survival\nthan in British Columbia.\n\n   Hunters shoot 25 to 35 grizzlies a year in southeast British\nColumbia, far fewer than in the rest of the province.\nGuide-outfitters have longstanding permits and quotas on the number\nof bears their clients can shoot.\n\n   ``I expect bears taken to the U.S. would be taken off that\nkill,'' said McLellan. ``There would be some kind of a deal with\nthe hunting guides.''\n\n   John Bergenske of the East Kootenay Environmental Society\nconfesses to ``a lot of reticence'' about removing grizzlies from\nthe mountains flanking his home in Skookumchuck.\n\n   He added, however: ``It is preferable to have an exchange like\nthat than have them shot.''\n\n   U.S. officials worked out a deal to compensate trappers in the\nYukon when lynx were relocated to Colorado.\n\n   Still, there are worries north of the border.
