Times News Service   \n\n   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Fed by winds gusting at up to 50 miles an\nhour, a wild fire here resumed its path of devastation on Thursday,\nforcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying\nat least 150 homes, perhaps twice that number, but apparently not\ncausing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where\nnuclear weapons are designed.\n\n   As officials warned that there was still little chance of\nbringing the blaze under control until the weather changed, a\ngrowing chorus of local and national officials began to express\ntheir anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had\nhoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent\nit racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.\n\n   As reports circulated here that the National Weather Service had\nwarned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the\nInterior Department, which operates the park service, announced\nlate in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the\nBandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, was placed on\nadministrative leave pending an investigation.\n\n   ``I believe someone is responsible,'' Sen. Pete Domenici,\nR-N.M., said at a press conference here on Thursday morning. ``The\nperson in charge at the park service who authorized the burn is\nmost responsible.'' He added that he intended to ask for a federal\ninvestigation of the plan.\n\n   Although more than 18,000 acres have already burned and more\nthan 1,000 emergency and fire personnel have been brought in to try\nand control the fire, there have been no injuries reported and the\nhasty evacuation of the huge number of people was described as\norderly.\n\n   But Los Alamos presented a disconcerting tableau on Thursday,\nduring a reporter's visit to the blackened streets. Fire vehicles\nrushed about, the skies dark with thick plumes of white smoke and\nhelicopters occasionally whirring overhead, carrying huge buckets\nof water. Most neighborhoods presented an eerie checkerboard of\ndestruction, with houses seemingly selected at random for total\ndestruction alongside other homes left unscathed.\n\n   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who flew in from a conference\nin San Diego Thursday morning, said the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory had suffered some fire damage but was secure. Energy\nDepartment officials said the fire had passed over some concrete\nand earth bunkers where conventional explosives are stored, causing\nno damage. The officials said that at one point the fire had come\nwithin 300 yards of a building where plutonium is stored but that\nthe building is heavily fortified and is safe. Though some nuclear\nmaterial is stored at the laboratory, there are no nuclear weapons\nthere.\n\n   Richardson said there were no signs that any radiation had been\nreleased.\n\n   Of the 11,000 people who work at the laboratory, only security\nguards and one dozen or two dozen workers in the emergency\noperations center remain, said Kay Roybal, a spokeswoman for the\nlaboratory.\n\n   Roybal would not speculate on how experiments might be affected\nby the closing of the laboratory but said that scientists each year\nmust plan around a shutdown from Christmas through Jan. 1. ``I\nthink there are ways to handle most of that,'' she said. ``Whether\npeople had time to do that this time, I can't say.''\n\n   Each day of the shutdown costs from $3.5 million to $5 million\nin salaries.\n\n   Initially, just the 11,000 or so residents of Los Alamos, a tidy\ntown high on a mesa at about 7,200 feet, had been evacuated. But\nstarting on Wednesday night and then throughout the day on Thursday\nthe residents of the nearby towns of White Rock and the Espanola\nValley, as well as Abiqui, were told to leave the area. Abiqui is\nfamous for having been the home of Georgia O'Keefe, the artist, for\nmany years and much of her work is still kept there.\n\n   A local radio station took calls from people all day who\nrecounted having been given just minutes to clear out of their\nhomes. Many said they had had time to do little more than throw\nsome clothes into plastic garbage bags, grab their pets and\nchildren and flee, with the smoke and flames visible nearby. One\nman called in to ask if any of the authorities had information\nabout his two dogs; he had not had time to bring them in before he\ndeparted in haste on Wednesday night.\n\n   The streets of Los Alamos were a crazy quilt of random\ndestruction. The heat of the fires transformed many houses, cars,\nutility poles and lawns into cinders. Typical was 49th Street in\nthe western part of the city, where the once tidy homes were razed\nin twos and threes, while right alongside them other homes were\nuntouched, the grass still green.\n\n   Viola Stowe, a resident of the city, who had been evacuated to a\nshelter at a high school in Espanola, said she watched a house burn\non the television news on Wednesday night, and only when the camera\npulled back did she realize it was her own.\n\n   ``You don't plan for these things,'' she said. ``You don't think\nit'll happen to you.''\n\n   City officials said it appeared that at least 150 houses had\nbeen destroyed and that the number might go as high as 300.\n\n   nn\n\n   President Clinton has already declared the region a disaster\narea, making it eligible for federal aid, and emergency officials\nflew in on Thursday from Washington to both help control the fire\nand to plan relief efforts.\n\n   Thursday in Washington, when asked about the government's\nliability for the fire, the president said, ``We have to look in to\nsee what the real facts are and what the responsibility of the\ngovernment is.\n\n   ``Right now we should be focusing on doing everything we can to\nminimize the damage of the fire and protect the lab assets, deal\nwith the human problems,'' Clinton said.\n\n   The fire was burning to the north and to the northeast on\nThursday, away from populated areas. But firefighters were still\nconcerned, in part because the flames were spewing burning chunks\nof wood thousands of feet in the air, where they were being blown\nas far as a mile and starting new fires. Also, any shift in the\nwinds could push the fires toward homes and the nuclear lab, where\nsome buildings have already been singed.\n\n   Kevin Purtymun, a Los Alamos police officer, said another\nconcern was that because the fires had left many houses and trees\nstanding, there was still plenty of fuel if the blaze roared across\nthe city again.\n\n   ``Really, anything can happen now,'' said Mike Gowey, a Forest\nService firefighter. ``There are spot fires everywhere. This is\nnowhere near under control.''\n\n   The National Park Service defended the practice of setting\ncontrolled fires, saying the fires are an essential means of\nheading off devastating accidental fires in forests that have grown\noverly dense because of fire suppression over the years.\n\n   ``The purpose of a prescribed burn is to eliminate underbrush to\nhead off catastrophic fires,'' said Michael Gauldin, the chief\nspokesman for the Interior Department. He said such burns were\nconducted over millions of acres every year, by the Forest Service,\nthe Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n   The fire was intentionally set last Thursday as part of a\ncontinuing effort by Bandelier National Monument to thin out some\nof the dense growth that makes the pine forests in the region among\nthe most combustible in the country.\n\n   Park Service officials say they weighed the factors that go into\nsuch planning: the amount of wood and other tinder in the forest,\nthe moisture content of the fuels, the relative humidity and\ntemperature of the air, and the speed of the wind. Then they\nplugged the data into a computer program and decided conditions\nwere auspicious for a safe and effective burn.\n\n   ``The data and the spot weather forecasts met the fire\nprescription,'' the Bandelier superintendent, Weaver, said in an\ninterview before his suspension was announced. ``It's not like\nsomeone was just picking things out of the air.''\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   Weaver said the fire team had requested and received weather\nupdates throughout the day, as late as two hours before the flames\nwere ignited at 7:20 p.m. Thursday. Seeing no reason to call off\nthe plan, the crew set the fire. Then, he said, the winds whipped\nup unexpectedly, and the flames began spreading toward Los Alamos.\n\n   About seven hours before the fire was set, the National Weather\nService office in Albuquerque faxed a report, requested by\nBandelier, predicting that winds on the ridgetops would increase to\n10 to 15 miles an hour that evening, gusting to 20 miles an hour\nthe next day. The report also said relative humidity would not\nincrease as much as it normally does in the evening, ranging\nbetween 15 percent to as high as 30 percent after midnight. A more\nnormal nighttime reading is 50 to 60 percent.\n\n   The weather report also predicted that a factor called the\nHaines index, which measures the tendency of smoke and flames to\nrise vertically, was at its maximum level _ 6 on a scale of 2 to 6.\n\n   Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona\nUniversity's School of Forestry in Flagstaff, said that these\nnumbers, while not ideal, would not automatically rule out a burn.\nIf the ground is too wet and the air too still, he said, a burn\nwill not do its job. And while a high Haines index might mean\nflames are more likely to leap into the tree tops, starting a\nrapidly proliferating ``crown fire,'' the vertical motion also\nhelps keep smoke away from settlements.\n\n   ``It's the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Covington said.\n\n   Weaver said that his staff attempted a prescribed burn in the\nsame area in fall 1992, when the air was more humid and still. ``It\naccomplished nothing,'' he said. ``We wasted our time and\nresources. ``\n","Headline":"\nLOS ALAMOS WILD FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF 25,000 PEOPLE FROM THEIR\nHOMES\n","Text":["\n   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Fed by winds gusting at up to 50 miles an\nhour, a wild fire here resumed its path of devastation on Thursday,\nforcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying\nat least 150 homes, perhaps twice that number, but apparently not\ncausing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where\nnuclear weapons are designed.\n","\n   As officials warned that there was still little chance of\nbringing the blaze under control until the weather changed, a\ngrowing chorus of local and national officials began to express\ntheir anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had\nhoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent\nit racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.\n","\n   As reports circulated here that the National Weather Service had\nwarned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the\nInterior Department, which operates the park service, announced\nlate in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the\nBandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, was placed on\nadministrative leave pending an investigation.\n","\n   ``I believe someone is responsible,'' Sen.
