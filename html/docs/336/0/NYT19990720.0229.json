Times News Service   \n\n   NEW DELHI, India _ Twenty Hindus were killed in three incidents\nbefore dawn on Tuesday in what is feared to be a stepped-up\ncampaign of hit-and-run tactics by Muslim insurgents in remote\nareas of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.\n\n   The worst attack left 15 dead in Lihota, a village in the\nforested Himalayan foothills of Doda District 90 miles northeast of\nthe Kashmiri winter capital of Jammu.\n\n   Five of those killed were members of a village defense committee\nthat was armed, the police said. The authorities have set up dozens\nof such militia groups to prevent raids in vulnerable areas, but\nthe brigades may themselves now be targets. The other 10 victims,\nincluding eight women, were believed to be committee members'\nrelatives.\n\n   India has been bracing for a violent backlash by militants after\ntwo months of furious fighting along the northern frontier of\nKashmir between Indian armed forces and hundreds of infiltrators\nwho had built bunkers in mountaintop positions above a strategic\nhighway.\n\n   Those infiltrators, which India believes to be a combination of\nPakistani army regulars and Muslim guerrillas, have been defeated,\nalthough sporadic fighting continues.\n\n   That ``humiliation'' is now driving the Pakistani-backed\nfighters to mount new attacks, said the chief minister of Jammu and\nKashmir, Farooq Abdullah. The killings in Lihota ``demonstrate the\nlevel of frustration among militant ranks and expose their sinister\ndesigns to curb peace and tranquillity,'' he said.\n\n   In the two other incidents, heavily armed guerrillas attacked a\nlabor camp in Poonch District and killed four men, the police said.\nAn Indian soldier also died in a rocket attack on an army post in\nPoonch.\n\n   Late Tuesday, an Indian news agency reported that government\nforces in Poonch had retaliated against the militants, killing\nfive. That could not be confirmed.\n\n   Violence again seems to be increasing in Kashmir, where, by\nconservative estimates, 24,000 people _ half civilians _ have died\nin a decadelong insurgency.\n\n   The deaths in Lihota represent the fourth mass killing in three\nweeks. On July 1, nine Hindus, including a 100-year-old and his\n90-year-old wife, were killed in the village of Ari. Two days\nbefore, 15 Hindu laborers were killed in the village of Sandhu.
