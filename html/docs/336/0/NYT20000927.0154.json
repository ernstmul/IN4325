The bear began\ngnawing on her face, ripping skin and muscle from her skull.\n\n   Van Tighem finally did something she wasn't supposed to do: She\nreached up and poked the bear in the nose.\n\n   The bear retreated.\n\n   ``Staying still didn't work,'' said Van Tighem, whose new book,\n``The Bear's Embrace,'' details the grueling 20-year physical and\nmental aftermath of the attack on her and her husband. ``If I kept\nplaying dead, I would have BEEN dead.''\n\n   The common advice always has been _ and still is _ that if\nyou're threatened by a grizzly, play dead; if you're threatened by\na black bear, fight back. But a summer of attacks involving not\nonly fierce grizzlies but also normally docile black bears has some\nexperts questioning those approaches.\n\n   The issue becomes more important as bear populations increase\nand human-bear conflicts, the term that researchers use for these\nsometimes violent interactions, become less rare.\n\n   In late May, a black bear preyed upon hiker Glenda Ann Bradley\nabout 10 miles outside Gatlinburg, Tenn. It was the first recorded\nblack bear fatality in the history of the Great Smoky Mountains\nNational Park.\n\n   Then, early in July, Canadian biathlete Mary Beth Miller was\nkilled by a black bear outside Quebec City.\n\n   After that, human-bear conflicts made news all summer:\n\n   _ Black bears clawed or bit four Boy Scouts in July at the\nPhilmont Scout Ranch in northeastern New Mexico.\n\n   _ In August, two backpackers were charged by a bear of\nundetermined species in Glacier National Park in Montana. One was\nbitten on the thighs and hips.\n\n   _ Also in August, a Calgary, Alberta, man was mauled by a\ngrizzly in the Kananaskis Country of Canada's Rockies. It was the\nsecond incident in 12 hours; those were the first attacks there in\n22 years.\n\n   _ In September, attacks have been reported in Clam Falls, Wis.;\nHoonah, Alaska; Grand Junction, Colo.; Anchorage; McLeod Lake,\nBritish Columbia; and Yellowstone National Park.\n\n   ``Conflict is increasing all over,'' said Gary Shelton, who has\nstudied bears for 35 years and written two books considered to be\nthe seminal works on bear aggression. ``What's happening is bear\nattacks are taking place where they haven't before, there's a\nhigher level of fatalities, and there are more deadly attacks by\nblack bears.''\n\n   Protecting people and their property from bears is a politically\nsensitive issue. ``Bears have become an icon that represent all\nthings bad mankind has done to nature,'' Shelton said.\n\n   New Jersey recently canceled a black-bear hunt after public\nprotest. In the last year officials there have documented 25 bear\nattacks on livestock and 40 on household pets.\n\n   Shelton, who lives in the remote Bella Coola Valley of British\nColumbia, began his career as a conservationist. He came to think\nthat bears were becoming ``overprotected'' _ that populations were\ngrowing too large _ so he ``shifted gears'' to study what people\ncan do to avoid or minimize bear attacks.\n\n   According to the North American Bear Society, nearly 800,000\nblack bears roam across Canada and all but seven American states.\n\n   Grizzly numbers are harder to track, as the bears are more\nelusive. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 1,200\ngrizzlies are spread throughout Montana, Idaho, Washington and\nWyoming, and 30,000 live in Alaska. University of Calgary\nenvironmental scientist Stephen Herrero, a bear expert, estimates\nthat 60,000 brown bears, the species that includes grizzlies, live\nthroughout North America.\n\n   Statistics on bear attacks are difficult to compile. Many happen\nin remote wilderness and go unreported.\n\n   Herrero, author of ``Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance,''\nestimated that on average, bears kill three people and seriously\ninjure between five and 15 annually in North America. ``Overall the\ninjury rates are very low considering the millions of interactions\nthat occur each year,'' he added.\n\n   But in August, Herrero told the Calgary Herald that the number\nof bear attacks this year is among the highest since biologists\nbegan keeping records 28 years ago. Specific numbers were\nunavailable.\n\n   If people want to learn how to co-exist with bears, ``it is\nincumbent upon us to figure out how they think,'' said Tom Smith, a\nresearch wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in\nAlaska and an expert on bear-human interaction.\n\n   Smith is studying grizzly bear responses to smells, sights and\nsounds associated with human outdoor activities. He travels through\nthe wilderness displaying different colored tent materials and\nplaying voice recordings, noting bear reactions.\n\n   Avoidance remains the best defense, yet some people are naive\nabout keeping bears at bay, Smith said.\n\n   ``Campers put papaya-guava-honey shampoo on their heads and then\nwonder why bears are paying attention to them,'' he said. ``Come\non, people, this is stupid.'' To a bear, that's about as inviting\nas ``bacon and egg shampoo'' would smell to a hungry hiker, Smith\nnoted.\n\n   Much of Smith's research runs counter to accepted bear-avoidance\ntactics.\n\n   He has discovered that pepper spray, a common deterrent,\nactually may attract bears if used incorrectly _ that is, applied\nto tents, containers or clothing as opposed to sprayed directly at\na bear.\n\n   Smith also published a study on the use of ``bear bells,'' which\nhikers hang from walking sticks, belts or backpacks on the theory\nthat a noisy approach will keep them from catching a bear off\nguard. He hung a row of the noisy bells on a bush. Over time, 15\ngrizzly bears wandered past the bells as he rang them; the beasts\n``didn't even twitch an ear.''\n\n   ``Some things that are taught as standard safety messages, I\nthink, `Why in the world do we do that?''' he said.\n\n   Smith sees this summer's attacks as an aberration. ``The\noverwhelming majority of bears have no desire to deal with\npeople,'' he said. However, ``there are those Jeffrey Dahmer and\nTed Kaczynski bears,'' like the human murderers, that set out to\nkill.\n\n   Shelton, meanwhile, is preparing a paper for the International\nBear Association conference next May that details his theory: Black\nbears, in certain circumstances, will indeed prey on humans.\n\n   ``There's going to be a slow, steady increase of predatory black\nbear attacks that will catch bear managers off guard,'' he\npredicted.\n\n   Shelton pointed out that because black bears and grizzlies\nevolved from a common ancestor, a ``true predator,'' each species\nis capable of predatory attacks. So the common advice to fight a\nblack bear but play dead for a grizzly may not hold true,\nparticularly if the bear has targeted a human as prey.\n\n   After conducting in-depth interviews with 40 survivors of attack\nby bears, both black and grizzly, Shelton now takes ``a strong\nposition against playing dead.''\n\n   ``If the bear is deciding if you're prey, and you play dead,\nthat's exactly what happens to you,'' he said. He devotes a chapter\nin his upcoming book to the topic.\n\n   So what is the best way to protect yourself in bear country?\nShelton said to carry pepper spray and use it correctly _ shoot it\ndirectly at the bear, then leave the area immediately, as the bear\nwill be temporarily stunned by the burning sensation.\n\n   ``Even though the spray success rate runs at about 75 percent,\nit is a far better strategy than the `play dead/fight back'\nconcept,'' Shelton said.\n\n     (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)  \n\n   Van Tighem, the attack survivor, advises hikers to ``be\neducated'' about bear encounters _ and be on guard at all times.\n\n   Despite literally losing the left side of her face _ including\nher eye _ and battling ongoing infections, she continues to hike\nwith her husband, Trevor, and their four children, ages 3 to 14,\nnear their home in the mountains of southeastern British Columbia.\n\n   ``I keep my head up. Alertness is very important; it's\nsurprising a bear that can get you into trouble,'' she said. ``We\nalso make noise and keep scanning the trail.''\n\n   They recently came upon a large brown bear, the first Van Tighem\nhad faced since the attack. ``I was terrified,'' she said.\n\n   Her family stood still.\n\n   ``It wouldn't budge,'' Van Tighem said, ``but it was completely\nnonaggressive.''\n\n   The bear ``sat and scratched, and dug, then took a few steps,\nbut mostly paid no attention to us.''\n\n   She and her family slowly retreated.\n\n   Back in the parking lot, Van Tighem's 10-year-old son, Daniel,\nsaid, ``That bear was acting normal. That was good for you to see a\nbear acting normal, Mom.''\n\n   The attack 20 years ago taught Van Tighem a lot about bears, and\nwhy humans react to them the way they do.\n\n   ``Bears are a metaphor for all the things we can't control,''\nshe said, ``things that are unpredictable and powerful and make us\nfeel paralyzed and question who we are.''\n\n   LF END SEFTON\n\n   (Dru Sefton may be reached at Dru.Sefton(at)Newhouse.com.)\n","Headline":"\n      AS HUMANS ENCOUNTER MORE BEARS, EXPERTS RETHINK ADVICE ON\nATTACKS \n     \n","Text":["\n   (UNDATED) When the grizzly charged, Patricia Van Tighem did what\nhikers have always been told to do.\n","\n   First, she scampered up a tree.\n","\n   The bear batted her down.\n","\n   Then she lay still on the ground, playing dead.
