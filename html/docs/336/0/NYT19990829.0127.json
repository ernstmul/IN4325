Times News Service   \n\n   NEW YORK _ May 29, 1996, was brisk but brilliant, a splendid day\nfor celebration and champagne on Staten Island as Gov. George\nPataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that the Fresh Kills\nlandfill _ the biggest dump in the world _ would finally close.\n\n   There was one small problem.\n\n   Until 48 hours before the announcement, no one in the mayor's\noffice had bothered to tell the Sanitation Department about the\ntimetable: that after Dec. 31, 2001, not a single old shoe, not a\nsingle piece of rotting refuse would ever again be buried at Fresh\nKills. No exceptions.\n\n   The department suddenly had to figure out what to do with the\n13,000 tons of household garbage that are added each day to the\nartificial mountain. Only a few months earlier, sanitation\nofficials were still counting on using Fresh Kills for 15 more\nyears.\n\n   Even now, with just over two years to go, sanitation officials\nstill do not know where or how they will dispose of most of the\ncity's residential garbage.\n\n   Few people would dispute that Fresh Kills is an environmental\nnightmare. Designed when even the most dangerous substances were\nroutinely dumped in unlined pits, the landfill has for five decades\nbefouled the air of western Staten Island with noxious gases and\nhas polluted the ground water with cyanide, pesticides and toxic\nwaste.\n\n   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said he was\nconfident that Fresh Kills would close on time. He pointed to\nvarious interim steps, like exporting household trash from the\nBronx and Brooklyn to out-of-state landfills, that have cut the\ndaily flow to Fresh Kills to 8,500 tons from 13,000. Even without a\nlong-term solution, he said, the city will have plenty of\nshort-term options.\n\n   The likeliest would be to send 600 sanitation trucks, each\nlugging nine tons of trash, in daily caravans through the Holland\nand Lincoln Tunnels to trash depots in New Jersey and elsewhere. In\naddition, at least 240 18-wheelers crammed with garbage would head\ndirectly to out-of-town landfills.\n\n   Outside the city, it turns out, plenty of rural counties and\nmunicipalities with modern landfills or costly incinerators are\neager to take the city's garbage _ and millions of dollars in fees.\n\n   At least the city is finally grappling with a realistic\nalternative to continuing to dump at Fresh Kills, said Chaz Miller,\na lobbyist for the National Solid Waste Association, a trade group\nin Washington. ``Fresh Kills is an environmental obscenity,'' he\nsaid. ``People lose sight of that fact.''\n\n   On a recent sunny afternoon at the Staten Island Mall, one\nshopper after another expressed doubts that the landfill would ever\nshut.\n\n   ``They've had like eight five-year plans to close it and they\nkeep pushing it back,'' said Samantha Jacobs, 19, who is studying\nadvertising in Manhattan.\n\n   Guy Molinari, Staten Island's borough president and a\nRepublican, is determined to prove her and other doubters wrong,\nand to end Staten Island's status as the city's figurative and\nliteral dumping ground. He notes that around the time Fresh Kills\nopened, six other dumps were operating in other boroughs. Over the\nyears, they all closed. Only Fresh Kills remained, growing so big\nthat it is visible to orbiting astronauts.\n\n   The result has been an immense, smelly humiliation. Town houses\nnow encroach, and the landfill's odors reach the exclusive Todt\nHill neighborhood two and a half miles away.\n\n   ``All other New Yorkers know is that their garbage goes\nsomeplace,'' he said. ``We've been abused to hell and back.''\n\n   To reassure constituents who doubted that Fresh Kills would ever\nclose, Molinari has demanded that the city's new trash plan include\nsteady reductions in the flow of garbage to Staten Island. And so\nfar the city has been able to do that, using truck and rail\nshipments to carry garbage to private landfills, mainly in\nVirginia.\n\n   But as that flow grows and as the number of outbound trucks\nincreases, roads, bridges and tunnels leading out of the city will\nbe jammed, some officials and industry executives predict.\n\n   ``There will be no escape from traffic nightmares,'' said Ron\nKlempner, president of American Marine Rail, a company bidding to\nbuild a transfer station for household garbage in the South Bronx.\n\n   Whatever solution finally emerges, it appears clear that Fresh\nKills, like an aging dinosaur, is ever so slowly coming to an end.\n\n   Most of the activity there now centers on the installation of\npipes to capture leaking liquids and gases. Only 150 acres of the\n3,000-acre landfill remain an active dumping area. No equipment is\nbeing replaced, nobody is being trained and supervisors are\npreparing to retire.\n\n   Molinari said he was confident that the dump would close.\n``We're going to have one hell of a big party,'' he said. ``We'll\nhave fireworks from one end of Staten Island to the other.''\n\n   But if the dump does not close _ and close on time _ he promises\nto be a very angry man.\n\n   ``We would go back to secession,'' he growled. ``Or I would go\nup on the roof of Borough Hall and shoot myself.''\n","Headline":"\nIMMINENT CLOSING OF WORLD'S BIGGEST DUMP PUTS NEW YORK IN BIND \n","Text":["\n   NEW YORK _ May 29, 1996, was brisk but brilliant, a splendid day\nfor celebration and champagne on Staten Island as Gov.
