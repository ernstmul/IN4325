Times News Service   \n\n   The first sign of trouble is an oddly shaped leaf.

Aphids.\n\n   Among the insects that plague a garden, the aphid has no equal.\nOld-timers call them plant lice, an appropriate sobriquet. A\ngardener's life would be easier, nay, blissful, if it weren't for\nthe lousy aphids.\n\n   Aphids suck the life out of plants. They feed on the sap, and\nthe penetrating mouthparts of a cluster of aphids are what cause\nthe leaves to become distorted. They can transmit viral diseases\nfrom one plant to another. They excrete sugars from the plant\nfluids, which encourage sooty mold, causing the black residue that\noften spots the leaves of an aphid-infested plant.\n\n   It's possible to avoid some insect pests simply by not growing\ntheir favorite plants. I don't, for example, grow China asters\nbecause I can't tolerate the black blister beetle. No such luck\nwith aphids. There are practically as many species of aphids as\nthere are plants for them to plague.\n\n   The slate-blue aphids on nasturtiums are bean aphids, the\nwhitish-green ones on kale are cabbage aphids, and the pale green\nones on practically everything are green peach aphids.\nChrysanthemums have their own aphid species, fat and\nchocolate-brown. The one that goes after crape myrtle will dine on\nnothing else, but the one known as cotton or melon aphid will\nattack a wide range of plants, from cucumbers to roses.\n\n   They may be black, yellow, orange or rose-colored,\nmatte-finished or attractively iridescent, like mother-of-pearl.\nBut the only thing to admire, albeit grudgingly, about aphids is\ntheir efficiency at being a scourge, a role for which they were\nbrilliantly designed by nature.\n\n   Their soft bodies contain little other than a digestive system\nand a reproductive system. They do nothing but eat and give birth.\nThey don't have muscles to speak of; they can barely walk. They\nonly develop wings if the population gets so overcrowded that they\nneed to fly off to a new food source.\n\n   That can happen pretty quickly. From the time they appear in the\nspring, and through most of the year, aphids are all female, and\nthey reproduce parthenogenetically _ that is, without benefit of\nsex. Moreover, aphids bear their young live, rather than laying\neggs that might be vulnerable to predators. An adult aphid gives\nbirth every single day of its two- to three-week life span, and the\nbirths are always multiple, triplets to sextuplets.\n\n   The young are all female as well, of course. They emerge\nravenously hungry, and they start producing their own young in less\nthan a week. The embryos that will become a mother aphid's\ndaughters start to develop in her before she is even born, and\nthose embryos contain the developing embryos of her granddaughters.\n\n   Aphids are fantastically, formidably fecund.\n\n   Only in the late fall do male aphids appear, and then only\nbecause the insect must lay eggs that will live over the winter to\nbecome next season's aphid infestation. Thus, controlling aphids is\nmost critical in the fall. Every aphid sent to its reward in\nSeptember is a million aphids that won't be around to infest the\npeppers next spring.\n\n   Fortunately, gardeners have allies in this crusade. An aphid's\nsimplified physical structure makes it easy prey for predators. The\naphid can't move very fast. It walks so slowly, in fact, that\nsimply washing aphids off with a garden hose each morning can kill\na good many of them. They starve to death before they can climb\nback up.\n\n   Insecticidal soaps, which clog the aphid's breathing apparatus\nand smother it, are useful, but the spraying must be thorough.\nYou'll need to repeat the soap spray in a few days, too, because\nthe last act of a dying aphid is often giving birth.\n\n   Among natural allies, ladybugs and lacewings are the best known\naphid-busters, and both can be purchased for release in the garden\nif the native population isn't keeping up. Adult and larval\nladybugs both eat aphids, but only lacewings attack aphids, and\nthat is only when the lacewings are in the larval stage. If you\nimport adult lacewings, bear in mind that you won't see results\nuntil the lacewings lay eggs and the eggs hatch.\n\n   Aphids are so plentiful that they are dietary staples for many\nother garden inhabitants as well, including spiders, ground\nbeetles, earwigs and crickets. While it is difficult for me to\nregard an earwig as an ally, I am happy for its assistance in aphid\nextermination.\n\n   A less visible but highly effective destroyer of aphids is a\ntiny native wasp, Aphidius matricariae.
