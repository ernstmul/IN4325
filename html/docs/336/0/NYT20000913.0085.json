Roads were declared\nimpassable.\n\n   The men and women in familiar yellow shirts and flame-retardant\nslacks were too exhausted to celebrate, but their relief was clear.\nThe mud, the rain, the cooler temperatures gave them a chance to\nturn the corner in their fight to bring the worst US forest fires\nin a half-century or more under control.\n\n   ``This fire in Idaho was big, and it looked like it was going to\nburn forever,'' said Douglas Johnston, a fire information officer\ntemporarily stationed in Salmon. ``It doesn't look like that now.''\n\n   Forests continue to burn across the West, but firefighters from\naround the country were leaving Montana by the planeload last week.\nThe Clear Creek Complex, as about 206,000 acres burning in Idaho's\nSalmon-Challis National Forest are known, is now 77 percent\ncontained, up from 29 percent only days before. About 450\nfirefighters packed up their equipment and went home or moved on to\nfires in other states.\n\n   Hunters and hikers were allowed to venture out again, although\nonly in approved areas and not soon enough to salvage the economies\nof Salmon and other small, tourist-dependent towns in fire\nterritory.

Summer is to\nSalmon retailers and river guides what Christmas is to merchants\nand ski resorts elsewhere. Salmon's relatively high-paying gold\nmine was recently shuttered, its namesake fish is off-limits due to\nendangerment, and logging is mostly a memory.\n\n   But tourists have stayed away from Salmon this season,\nfrightened by the fires only about 10 miles from town and warned of\nthe inaccessibility of favored spots. At one point, the air was so\nthick with smoke that people wore face masks and resident C.\nHokanson had to stay indoors day after day or risk an allergy\nattack.\n\n   The view of the mountains was so blurred that one second-grader\nnew to Salmon drew a picture of the town without them; he didn't\nknow they were there. The summer fair was a failure, the balloon\nfestival was canceled, and even some riders couldn't reach Salmon\nfor the annual rodeo, one of the biggest events of the season.\n\n   ``You add the fire on top of what we've already gone through and\nit's almost more than a community can take,'' said Salmon's mayor,\nStanley Davis, also the school district's maintenance supervisor.\n``It's like kicking a guy when he's down. People were already\nhurting, and now they're really hurting.''\n\n   Peter Stasiak, Lemhi County's newly appointed economic\ndevelopment director, said he has been hearing complaints from the\nmerchants whose stores line Main Street that business is off from\n10 percent to as much as 60 percent from the same time a year ago.\n\n   ``It's touch and go,'' said Thyra Warren, who owns Rendezvous\nSports, where visitors can buy their gear and book their fishing\nand rafting adventures. The store's business was down 37 percent in\nJuly and 26 percent in August, Warren said.\n\n   ``This is the worst summer in the seven years we've been in\nbusiness,'' Warren added. ``I make all my profits in the summer to\nlast me through the winter. I'm just hoping we get some business\nback now.''\n\n   Even with some forest reopened to tourists and hunting season\nofficially underway, no one expects a rebound overnight. Many\nlocals said they worry that the fires themselves will rebound once\nthe skies clear and the land dries. By late afternoon the other\nday, base camp had already turned brown, leaving the ground parched\nas usual. Deep in the forest, despite the fresh green grass, dust\nwas kicking up as temperatures began rising again.\n\n   Nationally, about 6.6 million acres have burned since January,\nthe agency said. For all the recent rain, for all the months of\neffort, 33 large fires were still burning on 1.4 million acres in\n10 states as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire\nCenter in Boise, Idaho. Six large fires constituting 633,231 acres\nremained ablaze in Idaho alone.\n\n   The fires in the Wildnerness Complex _ at 180,600 acres, one of\nthe state's largest _ are spreading. Even in the Clear Creek\nComplex 1,502 firefighters, 16 helicopters, and 27 engine trucks\nwere battling blazes. Among the firefighters were 600 Marines newly\ntrained to fight fires.\n\n   Still, by midweek, fire officials were using the word\n``cautious'' to describe their optimism. Firefighters, many of them\nstaying at ``spike'' camps as close to the fires as possible, did,\ntoo.\n\n   ``We've got plenty of rain, but it could easily pop up again\nsomewhere,'' said Jon T. Lee, 40, a member of an elite, highly\ntrained Type 1 ``hotshot'' team. ``I chase fires for a living, and\nI don't think I'm done chasing them yet this season.''\n\n   Lee said he expects to put in 1,000 hours of overtime this fire\nseason, earning an estimated $35,000 for six months of 75-hour\nback-wrenching weeks. For him, as for many others risking their\nsafety to contain the flames, the fires offer an economic boost, as\nwell as a surge of adrenaline and a sense of satisfaction. Each\nspring, before the start of fire season, lines form around the\nblock to join the crews, especially in cities and towns with few\nother job opportunities, according to one fire official.\n\n   Some locals have profited from the fires, too. Although they\nlost out on tourists, local hotels and motels have been filled with\nfirefighters, the parking lots packed with the equipment trucks and\nfour-wheel-drive vehicles the crews brought with them. Stasiak said\nanyone with heavy or logging equipment to rent or fire-fighting\nsupplies to sell has done nicely.\n\n   But in a county with an unemployment rate that hovers around 8\npercent, the fires have hurt more people than they have helped.\nStasiak, the economic development director, called tourism the top\nemployer in Lemhi County, employing more people than the hospital,\nthe US Bureau of Land Management, or a company that makes laminated\nwood beams.\n\n   Tourists spent $21.5 million in Lemhi County in 1997, the most\nrecent figures available from the commerce department. The tourism\npayroll topped $13.4 million, and that's in a county where Stasiak\nsaid a wage of $15 an hour is rare and many employees work for\nminimum wage or slightly higher.\n\n   ``We need to let people to know that we're in business, we're\nstill here,'' he said. ``Nothing has changed other than some areas\nhave burned.''\n\n   Signs pointing otherwise are everywhere, however, from the\n``Thank you firefighters'' placards around town, to the radio\nstations that offer regular updates on closed areas, to the mostly\ndeserted downtown movie theater.\n\n   And it has been a rough summer for hotels without business from\nthe fire crews. Said Linda Anderson, an employee at the normally\nsold-out Salmon River Lodge, where a double goes for $72 a night,\n``Business has slowed down 100 percent.''\n\n   Still, no residents said they were planning to leave Salmon or\nshut down their businesses just yet. Isolated as they are _ a 2\n1/2-hour winding drive from Missoula _ locals said they are\naccustomed to adversity, and the fires may prove to be just another\nobstacle to overcome in exchange for living in an area where deer,\nbear, otter, and longhorn sheep, among other wildlife, can be\nspotted regularly and the tap water is so tasty that the mayor has\nconsidered bottling it for sale.\n\n   ``We're known to be survivors,'' Mayor Davis said. ``We live 150\nmiles from nowhere, as some would say.
