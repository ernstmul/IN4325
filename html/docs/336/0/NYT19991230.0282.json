Times News Service    \n\n   SIERRA MADRE, Calif. _ As fire criss-crossed the hills just\nabove their home in this Los Angeles suburb on Monday night, fire\nofficials gave Laurie and Tom Daly the option of leaving. Not only\ndid they stay, they went to bed.\n\n   Yet another example of crazy Californians unwilling to accept\nthe reality of the world they live in? No. It was a difficult\ndecision, Ms. Daly said, and ultimately it came down to a simple\nvote of confidence in the firefighters who would spend the night in\nthe cul-de-sac at the end of their driveway.\n\n   ``When it came over the hill, I said to my husband, `Should we\nreally stay?' He said: `Yes. The firefighters are right out\nthere,''' Ms. Daly said on Wednesday as she unloaded belongings she\nhad stowed in her car just in case. ``They said, `We'll get you up\nif you need to go.'''\n\n   With national forests stretching for miles around Los Angeles,\nthe threat of fire is constant, particularly in the summer as the\nground becomes increasingly parched and the chaparral dry.\nFirefighters are highly skilled at handling such situations and\nhave extensive plans in place, but this year is becoming\nincreasingly problematic.\n\n   The fire season typically ends in mid-November, ``but this year\nit's just continued on,'' said Greg Greenhoe, the forest fire\nmanagement officer for Angeles National Forest, which makes up\nabout a third of Los Angeles County.\n\n   Less than a half inch of rain has fallen in the Los Angeles area\nsince July _ about four inches is considered normal _ and rainfall\nthat generally comes in the winter months has not occurred. At the\nsame time, high winds like the Santa Anas that blow in off the\ndesert pick up during the winter, and can make fighting fires\nextremely difficult and unpredictable.\n\n   But the biggest concern now is that New Year's Eve revelers\nusing fireworks could set off wildfires in the tinder-like brush\nthat covers the hillsides surrounding many communities that abut\nland managed by the Forest Service, which is part of the Department\nof Agriculture.\n\n   ``Fires are always a concern in the national forests, but we're\nespecially concerned now because many of our visitors may not\nrealize the danger they pose during dry winter months,'' the Forest\nService's fire chief, Mike Dietrich, said in a news release\nreminding the public that fireworks are prohibited in national\nforests.\n\n   The reckless use of illegal fireworks isblamed for a fire\nin the Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County that burned\nsome 4,300 acres and destroyed a house last week.\n\n   Eighteen national forests cover about 20 percent, or 20 million\nacres, of California. The threat of fire is highest now in Southern\nCalifornia, where it has been so dry.\n\n   The fire danger in Southern California ranges from very high to\nextreme, said Matt Mathes, a spokesman for the Forest Service. The\nservice is planning increased patrols this weekend.\n\n   There is no rain in sight, said the service's forecasters, who\nwork with the National Weather Service. Winds are expected to be\nlight from the southwest.\n\n   ``We are definitely on high alert,'' Mathes said.\n\n   Forest Service officials predict that this will be the second\nworst fire season on record; more than 500,000 acres have burned\nthis year. The worst year on record was 1987, when 747,000 acres\nburned.\n\n   But there have not been many ``catastrophic'' fires this year.\nOfficials note that not all fires are bad and that the overall\nimpact will be assessed through environmental studies.\n\n   ``California's ecosystem depends on fire to regenerate itself,''\nsaid Mathes, who calls Southern California ``one of the two or\nthree most flammable places on earth.''\n\n   Because millions of people live in that ecosystem, firefighters\nare faced with a major challenge.\n\n   As a result, an intricate network of agencies is in place to\nkeep firefighters where they belong and out of people's back yards.\nAn operations center coordinates efforts of the Forest Service, the\nCalifornia Department of Forestry, and various county and local\nfire departments.\n\n   Within 24 hours of the fire that started on Monday in the\nAngeles National Forest above the Sierre Madre and Arcadia suburbs,\n1,000 firefighters were trying to extinguish the blaze or were\nstationed in neighborhoods to attack it if it spread.\n\n   But that number of firefighters is small compared with what the\ndepartments can muster. Mathes said 5,000 to 10,000 firefighters\ncould be called up within 24 hours.\n\n   In addition, weather forecasters and fire behavior specialists\nare dispatched to advise on how the fire should be fought.\n\n   Still, firefighters cannot keep every home safe. That was clear\nto residents at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of\nLos Angeles, where about 500 residents were evacuated on Monday as\nfire raced through the hills.\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n   In many respects, residents got lucky because the winds remained\nlow.\n\n   Janet Winchell, who watched the fire from her front yard and\nleft voluntarily, said fire officials told her that if the winds\npicked up and moved the fire down the mountain she would have about\nfive minutes to get out of its way.\n\n   ``They came to our door and said get ready to evacuate,'' she\nsaid. ``We were going as fast as we could, dumping drawers.''\n\n   On Wednesday, Ms. Winchell returned to her house but had yet to\nunpack her van as smoke continued to rise from an area just over a\nnearby hill.\n\n   ``This is not fun,'' she said. ``It's very stressful. I'd much\nrather have an earthquake.''\n\n   Still, Ms. Winchell said she had no thoughts of leaving her\nscenic neighborhood. She plans to organize her personal papers on\nmore portable computer disks and to insure the things she values\nmost.\n\n   ``When you choose to live in California you learn to put up with\nit,'' she said. ``But you have to plan ahead.''\n\n   Perhaps even further than she thinks.\n\n   Greenhoe, the Angeles National Forest fire management officer,\nnoted that once the rains began a new threat would develop.\n\n   ``A lot of people don't realize it, but more property will be\ndestroyed by flood than by fire,'' Greenhoe said. ``This fire in\nArcadia has some potential to damage homes from mudslides.''\n","Headline":"\nA LONG FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA GETS LONGER \n","Text":["\n   SIERRA MADRE, Calif. _ As fire criss-crossed the hills just\nabove their home in this Los Angeles suburb on Monday night, fire\nofficials gave Laurie and Tom Daly the option of leaving.
