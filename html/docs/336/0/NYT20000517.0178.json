Antivirus software has been updated, users have\nbeen warned about its characteristics _ and those of copycat\nversions _ and the furor has subsided.\n\n   But I have bad news for you, boys and girls. It will happen\nagain. And again. And then again.\n\n   That is, unless, two major changes are made. One involves your\nbehavior; the other involves Microsoft's.\n\n   Viruses that bedevil computers are very much like sexually\ntransmitted diseases in the 3-D world _ they are spread by\nconscious action. If you don't engage in the behavior that spreads\nthem, you won't get the virus.\n\n   It's just that simple.\n\n   In the case of VBS.LoveLetter.A and its variants, the behavior\nthat caused the virus to spread like wildfire last week was the\ncasual way computer users regard files attached to e-mail. Many\npeople think nothing of launching an attachment sent to them, even\nif they don't know the person who sent it.\n\n   With Love Letter, users also were enticed by some clever social\nengineering. Like the Melissa virus before it, this nasty bug was\nspread by hijacking the address book from Microsoft's popular\nOutlook e-mail program. Someone receiving the virus might recognize\nthe sender's name as someone to be trusted, and would be more\nwilling to open the attachment.\n\n   And here's the problem: Internet and corporate network users too\noften send attachments, particularly Microsoft Word documents,\nwithout getting permission. To me, this is like giving someone a\npuppy for Christmas without first asking whether the receiver is\nready for the responsibility.\n\n   Attached files that can run a program on your computer are\ndangerous _ period. Word documents are capable of running macros, a\nform of automated routine. In a sense, a Word document is basically\na type of small computer program. As evidenced by Melissa, which\nwas a Word macro virus, it's a powerful capability that can be\neasily misused.\n\n   Most people know better than to run program files they receive\nas an attachment, so why should a Word document be any different?\n\n   In 99 percent of all cases, you don't need a fancy, formatted\nword processing document to get your information across. Plain text\nis always better for e-mail, anyway, because anyone can read it,\nregardless of their computer, word processor or bandwidth.\n\n   In the business world, however, Word documents are tossed across\nthe Net with abandon. For example, I get several a day as press\nreleases from public relations people _ and yes, I have gotten\nviruses from press releases! I simply don't accept Word documents\nanymore unless I arrange for them in advance, and I would urge\nothers in the business world to do the same.\n\n   The second problem has to do with how easy it is for automated\nprograms, such as macros or scripts, to make major and potentially\ndisastrous changes to Windows' crucial files.\n\n   The Love Letter virus uses Microsoft's Visual Basic Script. The\nfilename of the attachment is LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs. The VBS\nextension indicates it is a script file _ something the average\nuser doesn't recognize.\n\n   Microsoft includes this script capability in some versions of\nWindows and in its Office productivity suite to automate some\nprocesses. But while powerful, this feature is also pretty dumb; it\nlets a program do almost anything.\n\n   For example, Love Letter does the following, thanks to Visual\nBasic Script:\n\n   _ Changes the default start-up page for the Internet Explorer by\nmaking changes in the Windows Registry, the master configuration\ndatabase. The new page then downloads an executable that collects\npasswords off the hard drive and sends them to an e-mail address.\n\n   _ Installs itself as a series of files in the windows and\nwindowssystem folders, two key repositories for crucial system\nfiles.\n\n   _ Makes further changes to the Registry to ensure that the virus\nlaunches each time the computer is booted.\n\n   _ Reads the Microsoft Outlook address book and sends a copy of\nitself to everyone listed there.\n\n   The notion that an operating system allows this much destructive\nactivity to occur without at least warning that major changes are\nbeing made is outrageous, and Microsoft is to blame here.\n\n   Yes, the company is responding to a market that wants the\nability to automate routine tasks. And it would be fairly\nirritating if users had to approve every change made to the\noperating system, such as during a software installation.\n\n   But as Love Letter shows, Windows _ particularly the Windows\n95/98 family _ is simply too trusting. While I'm not sure that I'd\nwant Windows to be as locked down as Unix, users should at least\nhave a choice as part of its security features of being alerted\nwhen these kinds of changes are about to be made.\n\n   Until that changes, you can expect more attacks _ and probably\neven more vicious ones _ from across the Net.\n\n     \nNYT-05-16-00 1340EDT  \n","Headline":"\nBEWARE OF THINGS THAT COME BY MAIL \n","Text":["\n   Most of the computing world has recovered from the attack of the\nLove Letter virus.
