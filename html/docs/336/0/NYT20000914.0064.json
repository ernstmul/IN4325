The discovery may help naval ships and\nsubmarines spot enemy vessels.\n\n   Humpbacks sing over different frequency ranges depending on the\ntime of year, says Eduardo Mercado of Rutgers University in New\nJersey. Scientists had attributed this to the way whale behavior\nchanges with the season: in the summer, humpbacks are mainly\nconcerned with feeding, while winter is primarily a breeding\nseason. But Mercado felt something else was making humpbacks change\ntheir tunes.\n\n   To investigate, he ran computer simulations of how far whale\nsongs travel through water in different seasons. Sound propagation\ndepends on seasonal factors such as the temperature of the sea. His\nresults were unambiguous. ``To achieve maximal propagation ranges,\nhumpbacks should use lower frequencies in summer environments and\nhigher frequencies in winter,'' he says. When he compared his\nresults with published frequency ranges for humpback whales in\ndifferent seasons, he found this was exactly how the whales vary\ntheir song.\n\n   Mercado announced his results this week at the Oceans 2000\nconference in Providence, R.I. He says that a better understanding\nof whale song could allow the military to spot enemy vessels\ncovertly, as the sound waves alter their frequencies when they\nbounce off an object.\n\n   Mercado concedes that his method has its limitations _ not least\nthat whales have to be in the waters the military want to patrol.   \n\n     (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.)     \n","Headline":"\nWHY WHALES SING HIGH IN WINTER  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 2000)\n","Text":["\n   Humpback whales change their tune according to the season, and\nnow researchers think they know why.\n","\n   In response to changes in sea temperature, the whales adapt\ntheir calls so they can be heard by other humpbacks over the\nlongest possible distance.
