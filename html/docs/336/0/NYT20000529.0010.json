{"DocumentId":"NYT20000529.0010","TopicId":"NYT","Relevance":"0","Body":" BC-NEW&NOTABLE-AZR \n     (MOVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES)\n\n  \n BC-NEW&NOTABLE-AZR(a) \n      ANNE STEPHENON'S `NEW & NOTABLE' COLUMN(a)       (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) \n      By ANNE STEPHENSON(a) \n      c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic(a) \n\n   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:\n\n   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''\n\n   By JIM LEHRER  \n\n   (Random House, $23.95)\n\n   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title\npage of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The\nNewshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. We think he should slow down.\nThere's a hurried feel to this novel, the story of Methodist bishop\nJohn Quincy Watson, who in a crowded airport catches a glimpse of a\nman he believes to be the Japanese officer who brutalized him in a\nprison camp during World War II. Watson follows ``the Hyena,'' as\nprisoners called him, to San Diego, where he corners him in his\nhotel and proceeds to have a remarkably civilized talk with him, in\nbetween bouts of tussling that go mysteriously unheard by guests in\nsurrounding rooms. These chapters, alternated with Watson's\nmemories of the camp, are tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately,\nLehrer places his real climax in the middle of the book, and\nfollows it with a section involving a murder trial, lots of moral\npondering and a ludicrous ending.\n\n   ``THE SECRET LIVES OF WORDS''  \n\n   By PAUL WEST  \n\n   (Harcourt, $24)\n\n   New & Notable falls hard for books like this. Novelist West\n(''The Dry Danube,'' ``Life With Swan'') has assembled a list of\nwords he has kept over the years that are notable for no other\nreason than that he was curious about them. They are here\nalphabetically, with information on their etymologies and remarks\nfrom the bemused author on their modern usage. The only\ndisappointment is that our own favorite words (discombobulate,\nmelancholy, spellbinding) are not here. Among those that are:\ndunderhead, bungalow, grievous, italics, sad, blizzard, gremlin,\nescape, serendipity and a few obscenities that are treated with the\nsame affectionate civility as all the rest. West describes his\ndelightful book as ``a short homage to words, and the devious route\nthey have taken in coming usefully to us - some 400 in particular,\nmost of whom I propose to treat as honored guests, invited in (or\nout) for a drink, a handshake, and, in some cases, an exchange of\nblue movies.''\n\n   ``SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE''  \n\n   By FRANK KERMODE  \n\n   (FSG, $30)\n\n   Britain's Kermode throws out the welcome mat in his preface when\nhe addresses this book not to scholars but ``to a non-professional\naudience with an interest in Shakespeare that has not, I believe,\nbeen well served by modern critics, who on the whole seem to have\nlittle time for his language; they tend to talk past it in\ntechnicalities or down to it in arcanely expressed platitudes.\nEvery other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but\nthe fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of\nconsideration.'' There you have it: Poetic language is the focus\nhere, and if you have always wanted to be more interested in\nShakespeare than you are, if you've needed permission to be\ndiscriminating rather than reverential toward his most famous\nworks, Kermode is here to light your way. His book is literary\ncriticism, to be sure, and not for the faint of heart. But it is\nalso unabashedly inviting and invigorating - you will want to\nrevisit the plays armed with all that you have learned. Enjoy.\n\n   RED MAFIYA  \n\n   By ROBERT FRIEDMAN  \n\n   (Little, Brown, $25.95)\n\n   Friedman begins his book by offering his most impressive\ncredential, the news that Russian mobsters have threatened several\ntimes to kill him, slowly and in as grisly a fashion as possible.\nThe Russians, it seems, make the Italian Mafia look like pikers. To\nthe Russians, murder is blood sport - they will shoot you, a cop\ntold Friedman, ``just to see if the gun works.'' Now that we've\nmentioned this, you'll be pleased to know that these people have\nglobal reach, vast financial assets and an ever-growing presence in\nthe United States. Friedman has written about them for Vanity Fair\nand other magazines (hence the death threats) and now offers this\nenergetic book, in which he tells anecdote after anecdote in his\neffort to portray the Russian mob as the most savage and vicious\nbunch of thugs ever to reach American shores. He includes photos,\nand judging from the look of these guys (they appear both alive and\nlying in pools of blood) a Russian version of The Sopranos can't be\nfar behind.\n\n   ``THE FEAST OF LOVE''  \n\n   By CHARLES BAXTER  \n\n   (Pantheon, $24)\n\n   Its title doesn't begin to describe all of the things this novel\nis, or hint at the skill and daring Baxter shows in writing it. He\nis, in fact, his own character - the book begins with an insomniac\nwriter named Charlie taking an after-midnight walk on a summer\nnight. On a park bench he sees Bradley, his neighbor and fellow\nmember of ``the insomnia army.'' They talk aimlessly at first,\nabout Bradley's history in love and marriage, but suddenly Bradley\nhas an idea: Charlie should talk to real people, listen to the\nhuman beings around him as inspiration for his fiction.\n``Everybody's got a story,'' he says, ``and we'll just start\ntelling you the stories we have.'' So begins a chorus of voices,\nall connected somehow to Bradley, and all of them talking about\nlove, longing and loss. As the best of them, a streetwise girl\nnamed Chloe, says, ``You can't figure out love without figuring out\ndeath, too, but the effort it takes can knock the wind out of\nyou.'' This funny, wistful novel is a stage for Baxter's\nvirtuosity, and a reader's feast indeed.\n\n   ``IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY''  \n\n   By BILL BRYSON  \n\n   (Broadway, $25)  \n\n   It's a shame that this perfectly charming book about Australia\nhas to follow A Walk in the Woods, Bryson's hilarious chronicle of\nhis hike on the Appalachian Trail. That book afforded him a comic\nfoil in his none-too-refined hiking partner, Katz. Here he has only\nhimself, and the laughs are not as frequent or as incapacitating.\nStill, he seems to feel an obligation to be funny, as in a lengthy\ndescription of himself napping (he is not, he says, ``a discreet\nand fetching sleeper''). The book is best when he does not push the\nlimits of his persona - that of a curious, witty, friendly,\ninformative and very British (he is American, actually, but lived\nin England for years, as is evident in his writing style and his\naccent) tourist set loose in one of the most underpublicized\ncountries in the world. Bryson's travels include Sydney, Canberra,\nthe forbidding and huge Nullarbor Plain (its name is a corruption\nof the Latin for ``no trees'') and the odd and unfathomable\noutback. It's not hilarious, but it's a great trip anyway.\n\n   GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS: A TALE MODERNE   \n\n   By STEVEM GUARNACCIA   \n\n   (Abrams, $15.95)  \n\n   If the three bears had lived as Guarnaccia imagines, Goldilocks\nwould have bolted before she crossed the threshold, driven off by\nthe embarrassing surfeit of style. These bears have far-flung\ntastes. In addition to a Charles Ennie Mackintosh ``Ladderback''\nchair (1902), they own a George Nelson ``Asterisk'' clock (1950),\nan Alvar Aalto ``Savoy'' vase (1936), an Isamu Noguchi chess table\n(1947), an Arne Jacobsen ``Egg'' chair (1957), a Marianne Westman\n``Picknick'' casserole (1956), a Charles and Ray Eames ``LCW''\nchair (1946) and many other dysfunctional-looking objects. Our\nfavorite is a blow-up bed, designed by an Italian whose name we do\nnot know. Goldilocks makes short work of it, and leaves its carcass\nfor Mama Bear to find. Goldilocks, by the way, looks like a refugee\nfrom ``The Jetsons,'' and Mama Bear's mouth is on the side of her\nface, under her right eye. We found that to be disconcerting, but\nthere's no accounting for taste.\n\n   ``HIDE YOUR ASSETS AND DISAPPEAR''\n\n   By EDMUND J. PANKAU  \n\n   (Regan, $14)  \n\n   If someone had sent us this when it came out in hardcover, we'd\nbe gone by now. Ah, but we jest - Pankau's book, new in paperback,\nis actually quite depressing, because it is based on the premise\nthat you hate everyone you know including your spouse and children\n(how they feel about you is another book, maybe two). First, we\nmust tell you that he advises leaving the country if you want to\ndisappear, although he does give guidelines for remaining in the\nUnited States incognito. Second, he likes to say unnerving things\nlike ``Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,'' just to\nscare you into silence. He suggests that you consider faking your\nown death and erasing your tattoos. He also names countries that\nmake choice settings for a new life, and rates them (Costa Rica is\na winner) on things like weather, legal systems and extradition\npolicies. Even if you're not a felon, there's a certain\nentertainment value to all of this, and you never know when\nsomething will come in handy.\n","Headline":"\n     (MOVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES)\n","Text":["\n   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:\n","\n   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''\n","\n   By JIM LEHRER  \n","\n   (Random House, $23.95)\n","\n   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title\npage of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The\nNewshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS.
