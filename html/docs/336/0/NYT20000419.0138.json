(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  \n By COLIN NICKERSON  \n c.2000 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   MONTREAL _ When the Yanks started running off with the lynx, no\none paid mind. Canada's got lynx aplenty, so the attitude was: Help\nyourself, neighbor.\n\n   And when the United States Department of Fish and Wildlife\nspirited off entire packs of gray wolves for transplant to\nYellowstone National Park, quite a few Canadians _ ranchers,\nespecially _ cheered good riddance to critters often despised as a\npredatory nuisance.\n\n   But an American grab for grizzly bears is getting growls from\nCanadian environmental groups and ordinary folk, although prominent\nwildlife biologists in the country support the ambitious if\nlittle-noticed plan to reintroduce North America's fiercest land\nmammal to Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains.\n\n   Next spring, the US Wildlife Service hopes to start capturing\nsmall numbers of grizzlies in the rugged Kootenay region of\nsoutheastern British Columbia. The creatures will be freed in the\nSelway-Bitterroot wilderness, a 25,140-square-mile region covering\nmuch of east-central Idaho and extending into Montana.\n\n   Activist groups in British Columbia and Alberta are beating the\ndrums against the scheme. Canada may boast far more grizzlies than\nthe Lower 48 states, they say _ but that doesn't mean it has bears\nto spare.\n\n   ``Americans have this idea of Canada as untrammeled wilderness\njust teeming with whatever wildlife gets finished off down there,''\nsaid Michael Sawyer of the Castle-Crown Wilderness Coalition. ``But\nwe're on a slide toward the grizzly becoming endangered, too.''\n\n   Opposition to the project has taken on an anti-American tone,\nwith critics complaining that the US treats Canada as a bottomless\nreservoir of wild species.\n\n   Remarked one provincial environmental official: ``There's\ndefinitely some resentment at the way you people treat our\nwilderness as a sort of `Wolves `R' Us.' '' Many of the major\nspecies reintroduction programs undertaken by the US Wildlife\nService rely on animals from Canada.\n\n   Meanwhile, there's no question that Canadian grizzlies are\nhard-pressed in many of their home ranges these days, especially in\nbooming Alberta, where logging operations, agriculture, resorts,\nroads and an expanding web of busy hiking trails are intruding on\ncritical bear habitat.\n\n   Nonetheless, according to leading wildlife biologists, British\nColumbia still possesses such an abundance of the giant beasts _\nupwards of 10,000 _ that the removal of a few dozen would not harm\nthe population. They note that bringing bears to Idaho will mark a\nhuge leap for a long-range dream of restoring grizzlies to a\n1,700-mile corridor stretching from Yukon Territory to Yellowstone.\n\n   ``This is an extraordinary effort to restore grizzlies to a\nwilderness where they've been completely wiped out,'' said Stephen\nHerrero, professor of environmental science at Alberta's University\nof Calgary and one of Canada's foremost bear experts.\n\n   ``That's never been done in North America,'' he said. ``It seems\na good and neighborly use of British Columbia bears.''\n\n   The aim of the project is to revive a species all but eradicated\nfrom the contiguous states. More than 50,000 grizzlies prowled the\nAmerican West before the arrival of 19th Century settlers. Today\nthere are only 1,000 in scattered pockets, mainly in Yellowstone\nand Glacier national parks. (An estimated 35,000 grizzlies thrive\nin Alaska, but their habitat is so different they are considered\nunsuitable for transplant to the high Rockies.)\n\n   The last lonely grizzly inhabiting the Bitterroot wilderness was\nbagged by a hunter in the mid-1940s, according to the Wildlife\nService.\n\n   ``Central Idaho is a historic habitat for grizzly bears, but\nthere are none left,'' said Johnna Roy, a wildlife biologist with\nthe Service's Grizzly Bear Recovery project. ``We want to bring\nthis magnificent species back.''\n\n   One of the Wildlife Service's primary missions is to revive\npopulations of endangered species _ from wolves to whooping cranes,\ngrizzlies to black-footed ferrets _ restoring them to their\noriginal habitats where possible.\n\n   For example, earlier this month 30 Canadian lynx captured in\nYukon Territory and British Columbia were released in Colorado's\nhigh country, part of a program to restore the cat to its old\nAmerican haunts.\n\n   The reintroduction programs can be extremely controversial.\n\n   Over the past five years, for instance, Rocky Mountain ranchers\nhave howled bloody murder as Wildlife Service biologists\ntransplanted hundreds of wolves from Alberta to Wyoming and Idaho,\nwhere they've occasionally preyed on sheep, calves and other\nlivestock _ and, most alarming to ranchers, foraged boldly into\nneighboring states. ``Those Canadian wolves treat this place as one\nbig lunch counter,'' said Jake Cummins of the Montana Farm Bureau.\n\n   Ranchers and farmers have demanded a wolf slaughter. But a US\nAppeals Court ruled this year that the wolf reintroduction program\nserves a legitimate ecological purpose, and that the Canadian\nwolves must not be molested.\n\n   Now similar objections are greeting the proposed grizzly bear\nproject, which is undergoing final environmental review but seems\nlikely to go forward.\n\n   The commissioners of Custer County, Idaho recently passed a\nresolution condemning the plan and ``authorizing'' the shooting of\nany federally-protected grizzlies restored to the region _ although\nthe local prosecutor conceded the decree is probably illegal.\n\n   In any event, grizzlies almost certainly don't represent the\nsort of threat to livestock posed by wolves. They are solitary\ncreatures _ each bear needs roughly 1,000 square miles of territory\nin which to ramble _ and they usually keep as far as possible from\ncivilization. Moreover, 90 percent of their diet consists of\nberries, bulbs, pine nuts, insects, roots and grasses. When they\neat meat, it's most likely to be carrion, usually dead fish or elk.\n\n   But if sheep and cattle can relax, hikers and hunters will have\nto tread a bit more warily into the Bitterroots if the grizzly is\nrestored.\n\n   Put simply, griz can be grouchy on their home ground.\n\n   ``The real concern is for human safety,'' said biologist Roy.\n``When grizzlies come back, humans are going to have to stop\nthinking of themselves as Number 1 in the forest,'' she said in an\ninterview from Idaho. ``That means practicing some precautions.\nLike keeping clean campsites _ garbage attracts bears _ and hanging\ntheir (hunting) kill out of reach. And not trying to take snapshots\nof that big female with her cute cubs.''\n\n   The Wildlife Service's plan is to loose five grizzlies a year\ninto remoter parts of the region over five years, starting in 2001.\nThis seed stock of 25 bears should grow to an optimum population of\n280 animals.\n\n   ``It's a very long-term program,'' Roy said. ``We are looking at\n50- to 110 years to reach that population level.''\n\n   Grizzlies take their name from the silver-tipped hairs\nprotruding from their shaggy brown coats. Males tip the scales at\n600 pounds while females hardly qualify as petite, reaching 350\npounds.\n\n   Bears from southeastern British Columbia are ideal for the\nproject because their habitat is most similar to conditions found\nin the Bitterroot region. But some Canadians fret that their bears\nwill only be hauled off to their doom, claiming they will likely\nfall prey to trigger-happy Americans.\n\n   ``There's too much of a Wild West attitude down there, too many\nguns,'' said Evelyn Kirkaldy of British Columbia's People's Action\nfor Threatened Habitat. ``The Americans killed out their own\ngrizzlies, and now they want ours.
