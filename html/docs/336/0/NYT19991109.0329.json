KNOX  \n c.1999 The Boston Globe  \n \n\n   The ones who are noticed most are the marathoners who suffer\nheart attacks, such as the three runners stricken during the Boston\nMarathon last April. But the real danger is for those who get\nalmost no usual exercise and then go for a jog, chase the dog,\nshovel snow, or run for a bus.\n\n   A study of 640 Hartford, Conn.-area patients, published\nWednesday, indicates that the risk that exercise will precipitate a\nheart attack is 20 to 30 times higher among those who are\nsedentary, compared to patients who are usually active before their\nheart attack.\n\n   The report presents a double caution to middle-aged people\nconcerned about their risk of heart attack, its authors said.\nFirst, those whose hearts are not used to being stressed should be\ncareful about putting sudden demands on it.\n\n   Second, sedentary individuals _ that is, most Americans _ should\nstart getting regular exercise, beginning slowly and ramping up to\nmore vigorous levels, said Dr. Paul D. Thompson of Hartford\nHospital, who led the study. That will prepare their hearts, he\nsaid, for those inevitable bursts of activity ``that one can hardly\nescape during a normal life.''\n\n   The study found that one in 10 heart attacks occurred during or\nwithin one hour of vigorous exercise. About 40 percent had been\nrunning or jogging before their attack, while the others had been\nsuddenly stressed by such activities as running indoors to answer a\nringing phone.\n\n   The fact that such activities can precipitate heart attacks\n``should not scare someone away from exercise,'' Thompson said.\n``It should scare them toward exercise _ toward having some sort of\nan exercise program.''\n\n   The findings, which appear in this week's Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association, also suggest that individuals should\nreduce their other coronary risk factors, such as cigarette\nsmoking, high cholesterol and obesity, while they are beginning an\nexercise program. These factors, along with male gender, were\nstrongly related to the risk of an exercise-induced heart attack.\n\n   Thompson, who has studied the relationship between exercise and\nheart disease for two decades, said he was surprised to find that\nthe sedentary heart attack victims actually had less coronary\nartery blockage than those victims who were more active.\n\n   ``This implies that the exercise indeed was the provocateur,''\nhe said.\n\n   It fits with the current notion among researchers that a heart\nattack is not simply caused by a blood clot that plugs a coronary\nartery narrowed by plaque _ deposits of cholesterol, connective\ntissue, and inflammatory cells. Instead, it's ``the crack in the\nplaque,'' Thompson said, that touches off the obstructive clot.\n\n   Exercise increases blood pressure and heart rate, Thompson and\nhis colleagues noted, which may initiate the sudden rupture of\nartery plaques. In addition, an elevated heart rate ``increases the\nfrequency of the bending, twisting, and flexing motions'' of\ncoronary arteries, further raising the risk of plaque rupture.\n\n   A second heart attack study, presented Tuesday at an American\nHeart Association meeting in Atlanta, indicated that use of a $300\ndiagnostic test helped emergency room doctors confirm or rule out\nheart attack among patients with chest pain _ reducing hospital\nadmissions for such cases by 20 percent.\n\n   The results, emerging from a $5 million, seven-hospital study\ninvolving nearly 2,500 patients with chest pain, give physicians a\nbetter way of deciding who can safely be sent home because they are\nnot having a heart attack, and who should be admitted. The test,\ncalled a sestamibi scan, reveals if the heart's blood flow is\ncompromised.\n\n   ``People are urged to come in with chest pain. But if everybody\ndid that the emergency room would be deluged, and many would be\nadmitted unnecessarily,'' said Dr. Harry Selker of New England\nMedical Center in Boston, who conducted the study with Dr. James\nUdelson and Joni Beshansky.\n\n   Wide use of the sestamibi scan, Selker said, would save hundreds\nof millions of dollars a year nationally in avoided hospital\nadmissions and other costs.\n","Headline":"\nSUDDEN EXERCISE NOT FOR THE SEDENTARY, STUDY SAYS \n","Text":["\n   The ones who are noticed most are the marathoners who suffer\nheart attacks, such as the three runners stricken during the Boston\nMarathon last April.
