Times News Service   \n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 29,\n1998:\n\n   As the curbsides begin to disappear under bags of tinsel and\nleftover fruitcake, it is a good time to think not about what we\nbring home for the holidays but about what we throw away afterward.\nNew York City's 7.3 million people, plus the 34 million or so\ntourists who will have been through town this year, produce about\n26,000 tons of refuse a day. We dutifully recycle about 2,000 tons\nof that load _ an amount that should increase now that the city has\nwisely agreed to weekly recycling. That still leaves a lot of the\nsmelly stuff, some commercial, some residential, that must be\ncarted off and sent elsewhere.\n\n   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani earlier this month announced his plans\nfor closing the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, the world's\nlargest dump, by 2002 and rerouting residential trash through major\nbarge facilities in Brooklyn and New Jersey. As expected, New\nJersey let out a protesting yelp and Brooklyn prepared alternative\nplans and protective lawsuits to block more garbage flowing into\ntheir respective areas. To no one's surprise, the process has\nquickly become noisy and complicated as other proposals like one at\nPort Ivory on Staten Island begin to sound intriguing. However,\nwhat may be most surprising to those watching the dumping war is\nthat it concerns only about half the garbage the city gets rid of\neach day, about 11,000 tons. The other half is commercial trash,\nincluding such items as restaurant leftovers that are officially\ndescribed as ``putrescible,'' which may offer a clue why many\ncommunities do not like them being trucked day and night through\ntheir neighborhoods.\n\n   While the city recognizes two separate trash ``streams'' or\nsystems _ residential garbage and the privately hauled commercial\ngarbage _ the resident of Brooklyn or the Bronx who has\nbumper-to-bumper trucks running through the neighborhood has a hard\ntime smelling the difference. Garbage is garbage, whether it comes\nfrom a one-family house or the Four Seasons.\n\n   For that reason, Giuliani and his garbage experts, as well as\nthe various groups interested in this weighty matter, should be\nlooking at how all our tossables in black plastic bags will finally\nmake their way out of the city after the closing of Fresh Kills. If\nmarine stations are deemed best for residential garbage, why not\nconsider them best for other garbage as well? City officials groan\nat the thought; they already have enough trash problems trying to\nclose Fresh Kills without reconsidering the commercial system as\nwell. City Hall may be able to thus compartmentalize this problem,\nbut in the rest of the city it is all one big 26,000-ton-a-day\nissue.\n","Headline":"\nEDITORIAL: POST-HOLIDAY HAUL \n","Text":["\n   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 29,\n1998:\n","\n   As the curbsides begin to disappear under bags of tinsel and\nleftover fruitcake, it is a good time to think not about what we\nbring home for the holidays but about what we throw away afterward.\nNew York City's 7.3 million people, plus the 34 million or so\ntourists who will have been through town this year, produce about\n26,000 tons of refuse a day.
