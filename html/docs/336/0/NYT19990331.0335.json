What's left will be\ndivided among local governments, one other national garbage\ncollector and several thousand small local and regional haulers.\n\n   The consolidations are being driven primarily by the companies'\nefforts to deal with depressed revenues caused by a national glut\nof landfills and have been followed by price increases.\n\n   Some experts also say the national trend toward recycling will\nreverse.\n\n   Big solid waste companies lose money every time something is\nrecycled instead of going into one of their landfills, said Peter\nAnderson, a Madison, Wis., solid waste consultant and recycling\npromoter.\n\n   ``The concern I have is that recycling is going to be hitting\nsome rough times,'' he said. ``An oligopoly in waste will naturally\nextend itself over recycling and put the brakes on.''\n\n   Not everyone thinks consolidation in the business is necessarily\na bad thing for consumers. Large companies may be more efficient\nand cost-effective than small, ``mom-and-pop'' garbage haulers.\n\n   ``Running a landfill has gotten to be a pretty complex business\nin a lot of respects,'' said Winston Porter, president of the Waste\nPolicy Center and a former assistant administrator of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. ``When I was at EPA eight or 10\nyears ago, there were 6,000 to 8,000 landfills in this country.\nToday there are 2,900.''\n\n   Regardless of their size or the size of the company that owns\nthem, all landfills must meet federal environmental standards,\nPorter pointed out.\n\n   Consolidation in the business of hauling and disposing of\nmunicipal and industrial solid waste has been going on for years.\nIt has accelerated in the past decade, first because of new federal\nregulations for waste disposal, and second because of an unexpected\nnational ``glut'' in waste disposal sites, industry analysts say.\n\n   The new regulations were put into effect in 1989 and 1990 by the\nEPA. They required that landfills be lined with thick plastic and a\nlayer of compacted clay several feet thick. The landfills also must\nhave systems of collecting and removing the water that leaches\nthrough buried waste, wells for monitoring underground water\nsupplies, and systems for managing gases, principally methane,\ngiven off by virtually every landfill.\n\n   With these regulations, the local city dump was replaced by a\n``solid waste landfill,'' a highly engineered system for managing\nmillions of tons of garbage. As economies of scale took over, the\nlandfills became very large.\n\n   The country's busiest landfill, the county-owned Puente Hills\nLandfill in Los Angeles, received 3.7 million tons of garbage and\nother solid waste in 1997.\n\n   But while city and county governments operate dozens of\n``mega-landfills'' built or modified to meet the new EPA standards,\nmost facilities are privately owned. Until this year, four\ncompanies _ Waste Management Inc., Browning-Ferris Industries, USA\nWaste Inc., and Allied Waste Industries _ owned most of them.\n\n   This year, USA Waste, the third-largest company, took over Waste\nManagement, the largest. And last month, Allied Waste Industries,\nuntil last year the fourth largest, announced that it was taking\nover Browning-Ferris Industries, the second largest.\n\n   ``This is the culmination of many years of activity,'' said Neil\nSeldman, president of the Washington-based Institute for Local\nSelf-Reliance, a recycling advocacy group. ``The large companies\nhave spent years driving small haulers out of business or buying\nthem up.''\n\n   Seldman said that because they now control so many landfills,\nthe big companies can control the industry by setting the price for\ndumping.\n\n   EPA officials say that when they issued the 1990 rules, they\nexpected large regional landfills to replace smaller local dumping\nfacilities.\n\n   ``It would not make good economic sense to build a small\nlandfill, if you could get together with your neighbor and build a\nlarger landfill,'' said Robert Dellinger, director of the EPA\ndivision of municipal and industrial solid waste. ``We projected\nthere would be a reduction of the number of landfills.''\n\n   What was not anticipated by EPA _ or anyone else _ was that the\na country that was worrying in 1990 about ``running out of places\nto put garbage'' would overbuild and suddenly find itself with too\nmany landfills. As they grew and bought up competitors, the handful\nof national solid waste haulers were largely responsible for this\ndevelopment.\n\n   Now, said Anderson, a landfill glut has developed in the past\nfew years, resulting in prices that are depressed by competition.\nSmall ``mom and pop'' haulers, who typically empty their trucks in\ndowntown ``transfer stations'' operated by regional haulers and\nlandfill operators, could shop for the lowest fees.\n\n   But as weaker landfill operators were bought up by the national\nfirms, these fees started rising.\n\n   ``The 'problem' pricing entities have been removed from most\nmarkets,'' the investment banking firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell\nnoted approvingly in a 1997 report. ``Mid-American Waste, which had\nbeen in financial trouble for years, had been pricing low in order\nto maximize cash flow throughout the Midwest and several other\nmarkets. Mid-American was acquired by USA Waste in (the second\nquarter of the year) and pricing was improved immediately\nthroughout these markets.''\n\n   When a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell stock analyst says landfill\nprices have ``improved,'' she does not mean your garbage bill just\nwent down.\n\n   After USA Waste took over Waste Management Inc., it kept the\nformer company's name. It did not keep its landfill prices. Within\nweeks of the Justice Department's approval of the deal, USA Waste\nannounced a 40 percent increase in these prices at many landfills.\n\n   Anderson said that while the Justice Department requires merging\ncompanies to divest themselves of landfills in areas where mergers\nwould otherwise depress competition, he believes ``price\nsignaling'' and other informal means of avoiding competition will\ninevitably lead to continuing price increases.\n\n   Pressures on the industry will almost demand that, he said.\n\n   Anderson said the industries of hauling and disposing of garbage\nshould be divided, so that haulers compete for local and regional\nhauling contracts, and landfill operators then compete for the\nhaulers' business.\n\n   ``The solid waste industry is about to reach its end game after\nnearly three decades of consolidation,'' he said. ``That is the\npoint where two or three major integrated firms control the\nlandfills in many of the major markets.\n\n   ``Unfortunately, the Department of Justice seems to be\npreoccupied with the giant Microsoft case and has little resources\nto spare for the extensive effort that massive divestitures would\nrequire,'' he added.\n\n   Anderson said the industry is under ``enormous pressure from\nWall Street to continue to demonstrate high earnings,'' but without\nmonopoly or oligopoly power is too low-tech to do that. The only\nway to meet the pressure is to artificially raise prices, he said.\n\n   Meanwhile, the depressed landfill market is only one thorn in\nthe industry's side.\n\n   Recycling is another.\n\n   Seldman said studies have shown that hauling a piece of garbage\nto a landfill is six times as profitable to a waste disposal\ncompany as recycling it, even when the company collects an extra\nfee for handling recyclable materials.\n\n   ``The only way they do recycling is under duress,'' he said.\n``They will use their size to control the bins and the trucks and\nto discourage recycling wherever they can.''\n\n   According to some estimates, about 27 percent of America's waste\nstream is now recycled.\n\n   ``If you get to 55 or 60 percent diversion into recycling, then\nthe waste component will be the minority portion,'' Anderson said.\nNational waste firms ``are not stupid. They are not going to let\nthat happen. They have to make sure that recycling does not\nmaintain the option of growth.''\n\n   Steve Railel, a spokesman for Waste Management, said the company\nwill continue to ``grow'' its recycling operations.\n\n   ``The simple answer is that recycling is part of our core\nbusiness,'' he said. ``We are continuing to grow that business. It\nis part of the service that our customers are requesting, and we\nwill continue to provide it.''\n\n   He noted that Waste Management is the ``largest operator of\nrecycling facilities'' in the country and last year processed over\n5 million tons of recyclables. Recycling accounts for slightly less\nthan 5 percent of the company's total revenue, he said, down by\nabout one-sixth from the revenue share it generated for the\nprevious Waste Management Inc.\n\n   A spokesman for Allied Waste Industries did not respond to\ntelephone messages.\n\n   ENDIT\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   WASHINGTON _ While the government presses its widely publicized\ncharges that Microsoft Corp. tried to unfairly dominate America's\naccess to computer software, a rapid consolidation of corporate\npower is quietly taking place around a humbler but equally\npervasive part of life: garbage.\n","\n   As a result, some critics think, your garbage bill inevitably\nwill go up and the national trend toward recycling will reverse.\n","\n   If a series of announced mega-mergers is approved, the country\nwill enter the next millennium with two companies in control of\npicking up, hauling off, dumping and recycling more than half its\nmunicipal and industrial solid waste.\n","\n   The two corporations will be Waste Management Inc. of Houston\nand the entity created by the merger of Browning-Ferris Industries,\nalso of Houston, and Allied Waste Industries of Phoenix.\n","\n   They will share more than $18 billion in annual revenue for\nhandling what's left when we get through with newspapers, coffee\ngrounds, milk jugs and, for that matter, just about everything\nelse.\n","\n   That's more than half of the estimated $35 billion Americans pay\nevery year for garbage collection and disposal.
