PARVAZ  \n c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  \n\n   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ For those of you who thought Sasquatch fever\nended with ``Harry and the Hendersons'' _ well, you're wrong.\nThere's still a great deal of interest in finding one of those\ncreatures and making the myth a reality.\n\n   The third annual International Sasquatch Symposium that ends\nTuesday _ or rather just the fact that there is such an event, let\nalone that it's annual, international and five days long _ may\nconvince you.\n\n   And as long as the creature's existence remains an unanswered\nquestion, there are those willing to take a shot at answering it.\n\n   Once you stop rolling your eyes at what might initially appear\nto be an auditorium filled with nuts, some of the stuff actually\nstarts to make sense. So let's start asking some questions, like\nwhat, exactly, is a Sasquatch and who the heck are these 200-or-so\npeople who believe it exists?\n\n   The myth: The Sasquatch has been part of the mythology of just\nabout every culture. Among them: Yeti in Tibet, Yowie Man in\nAustralia and, of course, the Northwest's Sasquatch.\n\n   Joseph Page, a First Nations elder and storyteller from Mission,\nB.C., says ``Sasquatch'' is the Chehalis band's word for ``Crazy\nMan of the Forest.'' The Chehalis call the Sasquatch crazy because\nof his solitary ways, not because they think there's a lunatic\nroaming the woods. In fact, they believe the creatures are somewhat\nspiritual and help tribal members when necessary.\n\n   In a dedication ceremony, Page gave some background. ``It was\nthe Sasquatch that taught our people how to build our long house,''\nhe says. He follows his talk with a prayer that refers to the\nSasquatch as ``our brother,'' and asks for his wisdom.\n\n   Everyone in the room stands during the prayer, apparently\nneeding all the help they can get.\n\n   The believers: Pity the plight of the Sasquatch hunter. People\ntend to think he's crazy because, well, he has no proof that the\ncreature he's devoted his life to discovering even exists.\n\n   The flimsy collection of ``evidence'' _ shaky, grainy footage,\nunidentifiable hair samples, gnarled casts of big footprints _ is\ninconclusive.\n\n   In quieter moments, the believer admits this to himself. And yet\nhe can't help himself. He's hooked.\n\n   When considering all the eyewitness testimony and the\npossibility that he's been consistently lied to, Sasquatch\ninvestigator Thomas Steenburg shakes his head and says, ``Stop the\nplanet, I want to get off.''\n\n   Steenburg, of Calgary, Alberta, even seems a little depressed\nwhen he realizes he's spent 20 years of his life trying to find a\nSasquatch. ``Twenty years ... goes by like that,'' he says,\nsnapping his fingers.\n\n   While Steenburg is one of the more outspoken characters at the\nsymposium, the most colorful personality is Rene Dahinden, who in\nhis absence, is referred to as ``The Rene Factor.''\n\n   Dahinden is the guy everyone in the Sasquatch community knows _\nfor a couple of reasons.\n\n   First off, he's been on the creature's trail since 1956, three\nyears after he moved to Canada from Switzerland.\n\n   Then there's the matter of visibility _ Dahinden is everywhere.\nHe's appeared in two Kokanee beer TV commercials. Plus, the\n69-year-old has a voice that can be heard in all four corners of\nthe symposium, denouncing findings and investigations in his thick\nEuro-accent.\n\n   ``We saw enough fake films. You just take one look, you dig\naround a little and bingo,'' he says. And then came what Dahinden\nrefers to as ``that damn film'' _ aka the Patterson film.\n\n   Shot in 1967 on 16 mm color film _ 24 feet, 60 seconds, 900\nframes, each and everyone of them under copyright _ the film shows\nwhat looks like a cross between a female human and a gorilla\n(affectionately dubbed ``Patty'' by Sasquatch enthusiasts) crossing\na clearing in Bluff Creek, Calif.\n\n   How familiar this crowd is with the film becomes evident when\nJohn Kirk, president of the British Columbia Scientific\nCryptozoology Club _ http://www.ultranet.ca/bcscc _ is spotted\npointing out the significance of frame 352 to a timid radio\nreporter in his fast-clipped English accent.\n\n   Kirk is excited about the film, but Dahinden seems defeated by\nit.\n\n   ``I set out to prove that the film is fake, because that was the\nonly thing that I could think you could prove,'' says Dahinden of\nthe footage shot by Roger Patterson, a rodeo cowboy, and Robert\nGimlin, a cattleman.\n\n   ``That's what I've done for the last 30 years _ investigate this\ndamn film. ... But this damn film, we can't crack. People say it's\na guy in a fur suit. I don't want to listen to one more idiot. They\nknow nothing about nothing.''\n\n   He says what just about everyone else does: that people in the\nscientific community tend to stay away from the Sasquatch\ninvestigation because they fear what it will do to their\ncredibility.\n\n   ``So they are not getting involved ... but they say `bring us a\nbody.' If we have the body of the Sasquatch, we don't need you\n(bleeps) to tell us we have one!''\n\n   Them skeptics and them bones: So the contentious question of\nSasquatch's existence remains.\n\n   Bigfoot believers hate to deal with that question because,\nreally, there's just no getting around it.\n\n   They've never found any remains, but to most of the folks at the\nsymposium, that's beside the point. Take black bears, for example.\n\n   The wildlife branch of the provincial Ministry of Environment,\nLands and Parks says there are 120,000 to 160,000 black bears in\nBritish Columbia.\n\n   ``The mortality rate will conservatively be, say, at 10\npercent,'' says Dahinden, leaving us with about 14,000 dead black\nbears each year. ``One would think that you could ... step out 10\nfeet in the bush and fall over one of these black bears. ... You\nknow damn well that this isn't the case.''\n\n   So OK, there aren't any bones because the Sasquatch is a rare\nanimal and its bones either get buried by dense foliage and/or\nsnow, or maybe it just goes to extremely remote places to die.\n\n   Or maybe the Sasquatch is an alien from another planet, a\n``Hairy Angel,'' a ``Star Person.''\n\n   This, of course, refers to the panel discussion on the\n``Bigfoot/UFO Connection.''\n\n   At the risk of sounding dismissive _ oh, what the heck _ trying\nto follow the arguments by paranormal supporters John Cotton and\nJack ``Kewaunee'' Lapseritis is like trying to discuss NAFTA with\nthe Cheshire Cat.\n\n   Heavy-handed with vague references to quantum physics and\nmetaphysics, the two hold that Sasquatch is an extraterrestrial\nbeing, transported by aliens to Earth. They _ the Sasquatch _ are\nhere to give indigenous people guidance on herbal medicine and to\nteach us about the environment.\n\n   The paranormalists are not popular among the more zoologically\nminded Sasquatch investigators, but symposium organizer Steven\nHarvey says he feels obliged to include them in the event. ``By my\nestimate ... they are 25 percent of the (Sasquatch) people, and 25\npercent is something I can't ignore,'' he says.\n\n   The UFO people aren't the only ones who get attacked. When Chad\nDeetken, a member of the Sasquatch Society and a crop-circle\nspecialist, played his copy of ``The Bigfoot Recordings,'' narrated\nby Jonathan Frakes of TV's ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,''\nDahinden piped up again.\n\n   Before moving on, Deetken responded: ``I know better than to try\nand argue with you, Rene.''\n\n   Then Larry Lund, a Bigfoot investigator from Vancouver, Wash.,\nalso challenged the tape, calling it a total hoax. (The tape\nsounded like Tom Waits, ``Sesame Street's'' Gonzo and Don Knotts\nhaving a coughing fit at the same time.)\n\n   Dahinden also had a bit of an outburst when Grover Krantz, a\nretired professor of anthropology at Washington State University,\nreferred to some footprint casts.\n\n   Krantz says the emotional reaction to Sasquatch theories is\nunderstandable.\n\n   ``This is a little too close. This thing is close to us, close\nto human,'' says Krantz, who is tall, has a head full of thick\nwhite hair and big beard.\n\n   He adds that some of the animosity also stems from competition\nand jealousy.\n\n   ``See, the guy who shoots the first Sasquatch gets the first\nprize, the big prize,'' he says. ``After that, the scientists will\ndescend on this, and that's that.\n\n   ``There is no second prize.''\n","Headline":"\nFOR SASQUATCH BELIEVERS THERE'S NO TURNING BACK \n","Text":["\n   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ For those of you who thought Sasquatch fever\nended with ``Harry and the Hendersons'' _ well, you're wrong.\nThere's still a great deal of interest in finding one of those\ncreatures and making the myth a reality.\n","\n   The third annual International Sasquatch Symposium that ends\nTuesday _ or rather just the fact that there is such an event, let\nalone that it's annual, international and five days long _ may\nconvince you.\n","\n   And as long as the creature's existence remains an unanswered\nquestion, there are those willing to take a shot at answering it.\n","\n   Once you stop rolling your eyes at what might initially appear\nto be an auditorium filled with nuts, some of the stuff actually\nstarts to make sense.
