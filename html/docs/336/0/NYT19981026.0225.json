Times News Service   \n\n   GREENVILLE, Maine _ Wolves in the wild are mostly phantoms that\nshy away from humans as if they were poison. Pronghorn antelopes\nare so nervous that if one looks at them the wrong way they are off\nlike a shot. And short of tracking down a mountain lion with dogs,\nit is all but impossible to see one.\n\n   Usually, no one has to sneak up on a moose.\n\n   Not long ago, for instance, three people set out by canoe onto a\nsmall pond northeast of here. As paddles bit into the water's\ndead-calm surface, rings rippled across a mirror image of the reds,\nrussets, oranges and yellows spangling the autumn mountains. In the\nmiddle of this panorama, up to his hocks in water, stood a creature\nthat Ed Mathieu, a northwoods guide in the canoe's stern, has\nnicknamed the Goat Moose.\n\n   There are moose and then there are moose. Some stand tall and\nmagnificent, proudly showing off six-foot-wide racks of antlers.\nOthers are like the scrawny specimen that wandered through the\nstreets of a small Alaskan town every week in the television show\n``Northern Exposure.'' This one, too young to sport full antlers,\ndisplayed only two small, curved spikes that together with his\ncharacteristic moose ``beard,'' or bell, made him look, somewhat\nfoolish, like a big, stocky goat.\n\n   Far from spooking when the canoe approached, this moose regarded\nhis visitors placidly. ``Oh, OK,'' he seemed to say, ``you're not\nwolves.'' Then he resumed chomping vegetation from the pond bottom,\nas weeds streamed from his adolescent antlers and water poured off\nhis head, neck and sad-sack face.\n\n   Moose and people in North America have become bound together in\na new ecological dynamic, a relationship unknown since both species\nmigrated to the continent from Siberia some time in the last ice\nage, which ended about 10,000 years ago.\n\n   At the turn of this century, moose had been all but wiped out in\nmuch of their range by hunting and by conversion of their forest\nhabitat to farms. Now hunting is tightly controlled and many of the\nfarms have reverted to forest.\n\n   Natural predators like wolves have been eliminated from much of\nthe north woods. And perhaps most important, especially hereabouts,\nindustrial-scale logging has converted great stretches of the woods\nto young second-growth forest, whose abundance of tender leaves and\ntwigs at just the right height for a moose to eat has created a\nvast smorgasbord. Almost within sight of the Goat Moose, for\ninstance, recovering cookie-cutter clear-cuts had set a bounteous\ntable.\n\n   The result has been a population explosion among moose. Today\nprobably a million of the big hoofed animals inhabit the northern\ntier of North America, roughly triple the population at the end of\nWorld War II. In the northeastern United States, the population has\nradiated out from its epicenter in northern Maine, where moose\nnumbers have risen to an estimated 30,000 from about 2,000 a\ncentury ago, into central and southern New England. A lone bull has\neven been sighted near the Delaware Water Gap in Eastern\nPennsylvania. Earlier this year, a moose was struck and killed by a\nvehicle on Interstate 95 near New Haven, Conn.\n\n   In fact, accidents involving cars and moose have become common\nin areas, like Maine, where lots of people live near a forest. The\naccidents are frequently catastrophic, more so than a typical\ndeer-car encounter. Because a moose is so tall and heavy, its body\ncan easily crush a car when the animal's legs are knocked out from\nunder it.\n\n   On the other hand, moose have become a major tourist attraction\nand economic asset. Like the Goat Moose, most moose are\n``incredibly cooperative about letting people watch them,'' said\nKaren Morris, a wildlife biologist for the state of Maine. Moose\n``safaris'' have become highly popular in Maine, and Mathieu this\nyear has guided more than a hundred parties of people eager to see\nthis majestic yet ungainly and vaguely comical creature.\n\n   ``How could you not love an animal that looks like a moose?''\nsaid Dr. Charles C. Schwartz, a wildlife biologist who until\nrecently studied moose in Alaska. Now director of the grizzly bear\nprogram at Yellowstone National Park, he is an editor of ``Ecology\nand Management of the North American Moose,'' published last year\nby Smithsonian Institution Press.\n\n   The look of the moose derives from the animal's marvelous\nevolutionary adaptation to its environment _ the cold boreal\nforests of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n   Its long legs enable it to fairly glide through the forest,\nstepping easily over downed trees while predators pursuing it must\nleap or go around.\n\n   Its long, bulbous nose, lined on the inside with a wealth of\nsmall blood vessels, is designed to warm sub-freezing air so that\nit will not damage the lungs.\n\n   Its coat is one of nature's most superb insulators. It has two\nlayers: one a sort of underwool, the other made up of very long,\nhollow guard hairs. Like a thermal pane in a window, the hollow\nhairs block out cold air and conserve body heat. They also help the\nanimal swim (it can do so at a clip of about 5 miles an hour and\nover distances of up to 9 miles).\n\n   Moose take to the water largely because they cannot stand heat\n(but also because aquatic vegetation is rich in minerals they\nrequire). Winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero seem to suit\nthem just fine. Even in their lighter summer coats, though, they\ncannot abide temperatures above about 60 degrees. In their heavy\nwinter coats they become heat-stressed, panting with discomfort,\nwhen the thermometer rises above about 23 degrees, and seek the\nshade of evergreens.\n\n   What a moose does for most of its life is eat _ a lot. A\nthousand-pound adult consumes 25 pounds or even 50 pounds of\nvegetation a day in the summer and 10 or 12 pounds of evergreen\nbranches or twigs in the winter. (Moose are partial to Christmas\ntrees, i.e., balsam fir.) One year, Schwartz said, it took a crew\nof 10 people all summer to collect enough vegetation to feed four\nmoose for two weeks in a research project on moose digestion.\n\n   In its constant search for food and security from predators, a\nmoose is served by only so-so eyesight. But its senses of smell and\nhearing are acute. Its long ears move in an almost 360-degree arc,\nhelping the animal detect sounds far off. Moose ``are capable of\nhearing sounds humans would be oblivious to,'' Schwartz said. He\nhas seen them perk up their ears and turn in a common direction, he\nsaid, while he has heard nothing. ``Five minutes later, a vehicle\ncomes driving in.''\n\n   Yet moose tend not to flee from much of anything. One reason,\nexperts say, is that _ at up to six feet at the shoulder and 1,500\npounds _ they are just bigger than most other objects in their\nworld. They have few natural enemies, and even against predators\nlike wolves they stand their ground; moving might prompt the\npredator to attack, and in any case moose are formidable fighters.\nUnfortunately, they also tend to stand their ground against\noncoming cars.\n\n   In general, moose are considered the most docile of the deer\nfamily, and the most tolerant of people's presence. But there are\nexceptions. Douglas Kane, the state's regional biologist here, says\nthat mature bull moose hereabouts have become more skittish and\nharder to see. ``When they smell a human, they're gone,'' he said.\nIt may be, he speculates, that bulls are shyer because they are the\nprimary quarry in Maine's short, one-week moose hunting season in\nOctober.\n\n   Moreover, any given moose can be dangerous, and all should be\napproached cautiously and in some cases not at all, experts say.\nThere are two situations in which moose are especially dangerous:\nwhen a human comes between a cow and its calf, and during the rut,\nor mating season, from about mid-September to mid-October. That is\nwhen bulls establish dominance, with intimidating displays and\nsometimes clashes of antlers, and cows signal with moans and wails\nthat they are in the mood, a condition that normally lasts less\nthan a day.\n\n   Anything or anyone invading a moose's turf then risks injury or\neven death. More people are killed by moose, in fact, than by\ngrizzly bears, said Dr. Joel Berger, a biologist at the University\nof Nevada at Reno.\n\n   Otherwise, though, moose have become so comfortable with people\nthat, like deer, they have started raiding gardens and crops in\nsome localities. ``A few of them in northern Maine are beginning to\nunderstand the concept of broccoli,'' Ms. Morris said.\n\n   When a moose calf is a year old, its mother drives it away (to\nmake way for the next year's calf) and it must find a new territory\nof its own. Moose are now so numerous in northern New England that\nthe youngsters are being forced southward.\n\n   Two years ago, a young moose cow apparently got lost while\nsearching out new territory and wound up in Boston. She led police\nand state biologists on a frantic chase, at one point crashing\nthrough the yards of row houses near Boston College. ``You could\nhear the chain-link fences going down,'' said Dr. John McDonald, a\nwildlife biologist for the state. Eventually the moose was\ntranquilized and taken to a zoo, where she died; although moose\nhave sometimes been used as draft animals, they generally do not do\nwell in captivity.\n\n   With a breeding population estimated at 200, moose are no longer\na novelty in Massachusetts. ``As they become more common,''\nMcDonald said, ``people report them less frequently. Once you've\nseen your third or fourth moose, it's not a big deal any more.''\n\n   In northern New England, and especially in Maine, moose-car\naccidents have become epidemic. Besides being unintimidated by\nvehicles, moose are drawn to roads because they love to lick up the\nsalt left over from deposits made by snow-clearance crews.\nSometimes they lie down in the roadway to do this, presenting an\nunexpected traffic hazard. Another problem is that moose are dark\nin color, sometimes almost black, and they are so tall that their\neyes do not shine in car lights. So at night, motorists often do\nnot see them until it is too late.\n\n   Ms. Morris, the state biologist, said Maine averages more than\n600 moose-car accidents a year. About 15 percent of the motorists\ninvolved require medical treatment. And while Ms. Morris could not\ncite human death statistics for Maine, she said the state's\nmortality rate in moose-car accidents was probably about the same\nas the rate measured in Sweden: about 1 in 400 accidents.\n\n   The moose dies much more often.\n\n   Some wildlife specialists in Maine favor loosening restrictions\non hunting to reduce the numbers of both moose and accidents.\nPermits for the one-week October hunt are rationed; this year's cap\nwas 2,000. But other interests, mainly the tourist industry, want\nto keep the number of moose high.\n\n   New logging practices that rely less on clear-cutting and more\non selective removal of trees may well shrink the area of prime\nmoose habitat in future years, and as today's second-growth forests\ngrow out of the reach of moose their population may decline, Kane\nsaid. ``It may be close to a stable herd now,'' he said, ``stable\nor low growth.''\n\n   But for the foreseeable future, the evolving new relationship\nbetween people and moose seems likely to continue.\n","Headline":"\nAS THEIR PREDATORS DECLINE, MOOSE HERDS SWELL AND HEAD SOUTH \n","Text":["\n   GREENVILLE, Maine _ Wolves in the wild are mostly phantoms that\nshy away from humans as if they were poison.
