Should the ends be cut back\nafter the blooms at the bottom fall off? Can cuttings be taken in\nthe fall for the following year?\n\n   A. Congratulations! Only 7,999 more and you'll have almost all\nthe varieties. Meanwhile, keep the plant in a warm, semishaded\nplace, out of the wind. While it's blooming, feed it every other\nweek with a half-strength solution of balanced fertilizer. Water\njust enough so that the soil stays evenly moist.\n\n   Fuchsias bloom from spring to fall, but always on new growth. As\neach branch stops flowering, cut it back to a strong node (where\nyou see incipient branches forming at the base of both leaves). The\nplant will put out fresh branches and, in a month, another round of\nflowers.\n\n   If your fuchsia was in a greenhouse and is now outside, don't be\nsurprised if it needs cutting back quite soon. The rude shock of\nfresh air often makes these coddled beauties drop some of their\nflowers. It's disappointing but not a disaster; the plant will\nrecover as soon as it adjusts. Re-potting often has the same\neffect, so don't re-pot unless the roots are so crowded no soil is\nleft.\n\n   Fuchsia cuttings root easily in spring and fairly well in fall.\nChoose strong growing tips about four inches long that have three\nor four pairs of leaves.\n\n   Clip off the set of leaves nearest the cut and remove any flower\nbuds. Dip the ends of the cuttings in commercial rooting hormone\n(available at garden centers) and insert them in a bed of moist\nsand or vermiculite. Make sure the node where you removed the\nleaves is buried.\n\n   Keep the cuttings out of the sun. Water from the bottom so they\ndon't get jostled. Don't overwater; rot is the most common cause of\nfailure. The cuttings should make roots in six weeks to two months.\nWhen they do, pot them up promptly.\n\n   Raspberry Pests\n\n   Q. We have had a large patch of black raspberries along the back\nfence of our yard for years. Recently, I noticed that the\nundersides of the leaves of many of the plants were infested with\ntiny white insects, causing the afflicted plants to turn yellow.\nThey don't seem to attack the fruit, but they're difficult to wash\noff when they are on the berries. How can we treat these, short of\nripping out the whole patch?\n\n   A. The insects might be glacial whiteflies, white apple\nleafhoppers or any of several kinds of aphid, assuming, of course,\nthat they're not some variety of scale.\n\n   There are two possible solutions, each of which will eliminate a\nmultitude of bad actors. One is to spray with dormant oil in early\nspring, before the canes leaf out. If your predators are\noverwintering as eggs on the plants, this will probably smother\nthem into submission.\n\n   The second solution is radical cleanup, especially important if\nyou have not been cutting out the fruiting canes each year after\nthey finished bearing. Bramble patches that grow untended for long\nperiods often ``suddenly'' fall prey to diseases or insect\ninfestations that have actually been building up for years.\n\n   This fall, cut all canes to the ground. Rake up everything and\nburn or bury it. While you're in housekeeping mode, get rid of\nperennial weeds like dandelions. After hard frost, mulch around the\nstubs of the plants with a 10-inch layer of straw, salt hay,\ncompost, composted manure or any combination of these.\n\n   Next spring, thin each plant to the three or four strongest\ncanes. When they're about four feet tall, cut off the top eight\ninches or so to force fruit-bearing side branches.
