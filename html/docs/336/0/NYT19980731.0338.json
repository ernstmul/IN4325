Rob Deblinger, the\nstate's assistant director for wildlife, said it's possible the\ncoyote was hit by a car and picked up and nursed back to health by\nsomeone. When a coyote is accustomed to being fed by humans, it is\nmore likely to attack, he said.\n\n   Meanwhile, wildlife specialists confirmed that the number of\ncoyotes in highly populated areas in eastern Massachusetts is\nincreasing, and that while attacks are rare, people should avoid\nany contact with the animals.\n\n   As if to underscore the dangers, a pack of coyotes attacked a\ndog in Swansea Friday while a neighbor looked on.\n\n   ``I was waiting for the powerball numbers, when I heard an\nagonizing yelp,'' said Gina Roberts of Swansea. ``It was horrible,\nso I ran to the window, and they were running thru my yard -- it\nwas a mother coyote and three pups, and Alby (her neighbor's\nschnauzer) was in the mouth of one of the pups.\n\n   Alby, brutalized and bloodied, survived.\n\n   Coyote attacks on pets by coyotes are now common in\nMassachusetts, specialists say, and encounters with humans have\nbecome more menacing, though never violent before Wednesday's\nattack on three-year-old Daniel Neal, as he played on his backyard\nswing set. Neal was rescued by his mother, who kicked and punched\nthe coyote until it let her son go.\n\n   In Hudson, Deblinger said, a young coyote has been bothering a\nday-care center, where children often eat lunch outside. When the\ncoyote shows up, the children rush inside and the coyote jumps the\nfence and eats their lunch.\n\n   Carol Bellwood of People for Cats, a Falmouth group that\nprovides shelter for stray cats and helps people find lost cats,\nsaid coyotes have become so prevalent on the Cape and such a danger\nto cats that she would be in favor of an extended hunting season or\neven a bounty on coyote pelts.\n\n   ``It sounds terrible, I know, but it's a means of population\ncontrol,'' she said.\n\n   Coyote hunting season this year will run from November 2 to\nFebrary 27, 1999, but state officials say few animals are killed\nbecause no one is interested in the meat or the pelt. Officials say\nthere are between 3,000 to 4,000 coyotes in the state.\n\n   The proliferation of coyotes in Massachusetts _ and particularly\ninto its eastern and southern regions _ has been a long time\ncoming. The animals began migrating to westerm Massachusetts from\nthe north in the 1940s. The first coyotes were spotted in southern\nand eastern Massachusetts in the 1970s.\n\n   Susan Langlois, a wildlife biologist with the state Division of\nFisheries and Wildlife, said reports of coyote sightings have been\n``steadily increasing,'' with some fluctuations, from 81 in 1990 to\n137 in 1996. The slight dip last year, to 105, was due to the fact\nthat the animals are now so common in some places that people have\nstopped reporting them, she said.\n\n   ``You have people, after their third years of seeing coyotes,\nwho just don't report it anymore,'' Langlois said.\n\n   Cape Cod is the most recent place to attract a large coyote\npopulation, as the animals swam the Cape Cod Canal or walked over\nice floes, she said.\n\n   Earlier this month, Chatham officials hired a federal\nsharpshooter to kill two coyotes who had supposedly been plaguing\nthe town's population of endangered piping plovers.\n\n   ``The only place they don't exist yet is Nantucket and the\nVineyard,'' Langlois said. ``Whatever habitat is available to them,\nthey'll adapt to it.''\n\n   Linda Cocca of the Massachusetts Audubon Society in Lincoln\nagrees. ``They're in Concord and Lincoln and Weston,'' Cocca said.\n``Not in huge numbers, but I'll occasionally get a call.''\n\n   Coyotes are highly adaptable, and can live off compost piles,\ntrash bins, or scraps of food left for them by people, wildlife\nofficials say.\n\n   Deblinger said his office is hampered in dealing with coyote\ncomplaints because a law passed by voters in 1996 bars the use of\nleg-hold traps. He said a trap is much more effective in dealing\nwith a nuisance coyote than trying to shoot it.\n\n   ``To try to hunt them down with a gun, you're never at the right\nplace at the right time,'' he said. ``So we feel very helpless when\nit comes to these sitatutions.''\n","Headline":"\nCOYOTE THAT ATTACKED BOY HAD FRACTURED LEG, OFFICIAL SAYS \n","Text":["\n   SANDWICH, Mass. -- The coyote that mauled a three-year old boy\nhere was not carrying rabies, but an examination of the animal's\nbody turned up a possibly important clue as to why the rare attack\noccurred, state officials said.\n","\n   The coyote's right front leg had been fractured and healed some\ntime ago, most likely when it was very young.
