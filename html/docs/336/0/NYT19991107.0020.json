There are so few of us, we'd be lucky to catch 1 percent\nof them.''\n\n   Recent poaching cases include a man wardens call ``Trash Can\nJoe'' who wardens said was caught trying to poach black bear in the\nforest above Los Angeles.\n\n   There also was the case of two Glendale residents accused of\nshooting a wild pig in Monterey County, and archers who stalk deer\nat the reservoirs and a cemetery in Los Angeles' San Fernando\nValley.\n\n   Altogether, wardens issued 1,818 poaching violations countywide\nlast year, mostly for fishing violations, but the figure includes\n57 hunting cases. These range from the illegal use of lights to\nstun deer to the illegal sale of bear organs, an Asian delicacy\nthought to cure arthritis, gastric disturbances and a range of\nailments.\n\n   Despite the proximity of millions of people, an incredible\nvariety of wildlife thrives in the hills and mountains around Los\nAngeles in numbers far surpassing mountainous areas elsewhere in\nthe state, according to Lt. Warden Terry Hodges, who has written\nthree books on the adventures of California game wardens.\n\n   ``These same city wardens deal with more outlaw hunters and\nfisherman than most wardens elsewhere,'' he said.\n\n   Driving much of this near-urban poaching is the market for\nanimal parts like bear gall bladders, wild meats and abalone that\nsell for thousands of dollars.\n\n   ``The commercialization of wildlife is a serious problem,''\nUlrich said. ``That is the biggest problem with poaching in the\ncity.''\n\n   Poaching in California is a $100-million-a-year business, an\nextremely lucrative enterprise, wardens said.\n\n   ``It's big business,'' said Fish and Game Warden Capt. Jerry\nSpansail, who supervises inland wardens in Los Angeles and Orange\ncounties. ``In some places it's more lucrative than narcotics.''\n\n   Even among wardens, the man they call ``Trash Can Joe'' is a\nlegend. The licensed hunting guide earned his nickname after he was\narrested for shooting an arrow into a bear rooting around in a\ntrash dumpster a few years ago, wardens said.\n\n   But that man, John Joseph Clay, referred to himself as ``Black\nRobinhood,'' Ulrich said. While serving a search warrant at his\nhome after the trash can incident, wardens discovered a stack of\nbusiness cards, which read: ``Black Robinhood Guide Service _\nTrophy Bear and Deer Hunts,'' Hodges said.\n\n   On Aug. 19, 1998, following a tip, Ulrich and Warden Mike Conely\ndiscovered Clay's bait pile of doughnuts and rotten meat in the\nAngeles National Forest above Los Angeles, Hodges said.\n\n   On the platform 18 feet up a tree, he had an ice chest with\nbeer, a charcoal barbecue, food and ``glow sticks,'' chemical light\ngenerating devices, Hodges said.\n\n   The wardens hid in the brush and watched as Clay returned with a\nbow and arrow and began to add to his bait pile, hanging a glow\nstick above it.\n\n   Finally, Conely came out of the brush and ordered Clay to come\ndown. He did so but not before placing a blanket over the barbecue,\nstarting a fire in the tree as a diversion, Hodges said.\n\n   Conely climbed up and doused the fire with ice water and beer.\nHe discovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver.\n\n   Clay pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of unlawful hunting\nand possession of a concealed weapon, said Deputy District Attorney\nMaureen O'Brien. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, fined $4,050,\nordered to pay $2,000 restitution and told not to hunt and\nadvertise himself as a hunting guide for three years, O'Brien said.\n\n   If they can't find the animal they want in the hills around Los\nAngeles, they will travel.\n\n   Glendale residents Artak Oktanian and Vagan Abgaryan were\narrested on suspicion of shooting a wild pig on a private ranch in\nMonterey County and returning to Glendale with the animal in the\nback of their Jeep, Ulrich said.\n\n   ``It was still alive, just barely,'' Ulrich said. ``That pig\nsuffered for four hours. They were going to eat it.''\n\n   They are accused of hunter trespass and unlawful possession of a\nwild pig, Monterey County Warden Jim Solis said, adding the case\nhas not gone to court yet.\n\n   Solis estimates he arrests about 50 Glendale and North Hollywood\nresidents a year in Monterey County who hunt the pigs without\nlicenses, on private lands or with spotlights.\n\n   ``There does seem to be an inordinate amount of people from\nGlendale and North Hollywood,'' he said, explaining that wild pig\napparently is a popular dish. ``I've heard they are pretty fond of\nthe pigs.''\n\n   In the last year, Ulrich and other wardens have investigated\ndeer poaching in the hills above Sylmar, spearfishing and net\nfishing in Big Tujunga Creek and Castaic Lake and the sale of bear\ngall bladders in the San Fernando Valley.\n\n   By far, deer poaching is the most prevalent.\n\n   Hunters were caught recently at the Encino Reservoir with rifles\nand another time workers found blinds used by bow hunters,\nofficials said.\n\n   Wardens now have a new weapon in the fight against poachers:\n``Robo-Deer,'' the robotic decoy wardens use in sting operations to\ncatch poachers.\n\n   The decoy features a turning head and twitching tail, which from\na distance looks like the real thing.
