It's difficult to figure\nwhich movie is more pungently, unrepentantly vicious.\n\n   ``Men'' was cruel and nasty with pointed specificity: Two\nmisogynist SOBs target a pretty, deaf woman and sexually play her\nlike a wounded mouse before biting her head off and chewing between\ntriumphant cackles _ all figuratively speaking, of course.\n\n   ``Friends' '' malignancy is more expansive: Six lovelorn\ncharacters knit a cat's cradle of lies, insults, betrayal and\nrevenge, with the outcome a steaming battlefield of mutilated egos.\nWar is hell? Try love.\n\n   LaBute wields his misanthropy the way David Mamet does. He's\nconvinced backstabbing and verbal violence are banal human\npastimes, not merely social pathologies, and amplifies this view to\ndeafening levels for heightened dramatic effect.\n\n   He's fascinated by this behavior and observes it like a maker of\nnature films. Camera hidden in the brush, he captures our species\nas it conducts its exotic social rituals. He also captures those\nwincing scenes of predation; the lion always gets the gazelle.\n\n   What makes it all so chilling is that LaBute never blinks. He\nremains an amorally distant and nonjudgmental spectator. Like the\ncallous nature shooters who watch the food chain without heroically\ndisrupting it, LaBute is aloof, and you just know he's smirking\nbehind that tree.\n\n   Richly written and incisively acted by a cast that includes\nJason Patric, Amy Brenneman, gifted indie princess Catherine Keener\nand Ben Stiller, in perhaps his best performance, ``Your Friends &\nNeighbors'' is the sort of bleak comedy of manners Woody Allen\nwould have made if he was of a different era. (Scenes and\ncharacters frequently echo those in ``Manhattan.'') We laugh at how\nsick people can be, then curdle at the similarities to ourselves.\n\n   Populated by smart, urban neurotics, the movie, like Allen's, is\nobsessed with sex, positively drenched in the concept of coitus.\nBut there's not a single nude scene. What's nude are the\ncharacters' interiors, stripped of flattering light, dignity and\nself-worth. The unsparing candor is squirm-inducing.\n\n   The extremity of the cruelty nudges the movie into the absurd,\nbordering on an especially cerebral brand of farce. The tip-off\nLaBute is operating on levels viewers may not anticipate arrives in\nan over-the-top scene in which Patric's psychotic scoundrel\ndescribes in unreal detail his ``best f----.'' (If any more\ndialogue were to be transcribed, this page would become a hailstorm\nof Morse code dashes.)\n\n   Despite the movie's meticulous structure, the six characters _\ntwo married couples, Patric's icy misogynist and Nastassja Kinski's\nlesbian artist's assistant _ seem to float about in a largely\nplotless universe. The ``friends'' have each other over for dinner,\nmeet at cafes and used book stores, bond at the gym, make\nacquaintances at art galleries, and engage in various degrees of\nreally bad sex. (The ``Manhattan'' echoes grow louder.)\n\n   The characters' names and the movie's urban setting are never\nspoken; LaBute doesn't want to distract us from the psychological\nhell he's constructing with tactile trivia. What LaBute, an alert\nand expressive visualist, is concerned with are his characters'\nactions and words, and his literate, tightly crafted and shrewdly\nnuanced writing bears this out. The story emerges from what these\nflawed people do; their fate never seems preordained by a narrative\nblueprint. They act horrendously, then feel bad. Repeat.\n\n   This makes room for the excellent performers to develop\nfull-bodied characters. A lesser cast would kill this movie.\n\n   Stiller, as the stammering Woody character, shows again he is\nour best modern parodist. Keener is sharp and typically commanding.\nPatric will repulse you with his twisted intensity. And Aaron\nEckhart, so convincingly repugnant in ``In the Company of Men,''\nembodies the sad cuckold, complete with added flab, a dreadful\nmustache and a matted, Hitlerian haircut.\n\n   LaBute is shaping up as an exciting filmmaker with a singular\nsatirical spin. His work is sophisticated and uncompromising in\nways that make you laugh and think with equal vigor.\n\n   ``Friends'' is a darkly audacious film (the chamber orchestra\nplaying Metallica songs over the credits hints at things\nsubversive) that bristles with the prickly stuff of life. And the\nfiendish LaBute finds clever ways of weaving in his ugly themes.\nWhen a character drop kicks a plastic fetus, you're suddenly\nwatching allegory.\n\n   Chris Garcia is the film critic for the Austin\nAmerican-Statesman\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service\n","Headline":"\n    \n","Text":["\n   AUSTIN _ `Your Friends & Neighbors' Starring: Ben Stiller,\nCatherine Keener, Jason Patric, Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhart,\nNastassja Kinski Director: Neil LaBute Screenwriter: Neil LaBute\nMPAA rating: R for sexually explicit language, adult themes\n","\n   Neil LaBute's chatty acid-bath ``Your Friends & Neighbors'' is\nthe writer-director's follow-up to last year's savage and\nincendiary ``In the Company of Men.''
