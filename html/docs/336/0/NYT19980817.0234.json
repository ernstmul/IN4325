Times News Service   \n\n   Almost exactly three months ago, Craig Dahl, 26, a park\nconcessions worker, took his last hike, setting out on a steep,\nwinding trail above Two Medicine Valley in the southeast corner of\nGlacier National Park in Montana. He never returned.\n\n   Three days later, on May 20, rangers discovered the grisly\nscene: Dahl's partly consumed body cached in a clump of vegetation\ndown slope from a trail.\n\n   From the physical evidence, searchers surmised that a female\ngrizzly bear and her two cubs had preyed upon Dahl. Experts then,\nworking with the tools of forensic science, identified the\nculprits, tracked them down and had them destroyed.\n\n   Yet in many ways the mystery was just beginning. Research\nsuggested that the female was a grizzly, nicknamed Chocolate Legs\nfor her distinctive coloring, who had been identified as a problem\nbear in 1983, captured, and moved to the park's back country.\n\n   She lived the normal life of a bear in the wild until 1997, when\nshe and her cubs again became bold around people. What triggered\nthat change? Why, a year later, did the bears stalk, kill and eat a\nhuman _ predatory behavior extremely rare among grizzlies?\n\n   On average, bears kill two people a year in North America, with\nthe number equally split between grizzlies and the far more\nnumerous black bears. In Glacier and Yellowstone, the national\nparks in the United States with the most grizzly bears, the\nfrequency of fatal attacks is considerably less.\n\n   Between 1910 and this year, bears have killed 10 people,\nincluding Dahl, in Glacier; in Yellowstone, the total is 5 since\n1839.\n\n   Nearly all attacks on humans result from a bear's defense of its\ncubs, its food, or itself, according to Christopher Servheen,\ncoordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grizzly bear\nrecovery program. ``Grizzlies are generally nonpredatory toward\npeople,'' he said.\n\n   Still, weighing up to 1,000 pounds, grizzlies are formidable\npredators, and their attacks, fierce enough in their own right, are\noften sensationalized in popular accounts to make the big, powerful\nbears seem more ferocious and dangerous than they are.\n\n   Because wildlife officials hope to allay that fear and because\nthe 1,000 or so grizzlies left in the lower 48 states _ from a\npresettlement population estimated at 50,000 _ are listed as\n``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act, they thoroughly\ninvestigate every bear attack.\n\n   Within days of discovering the remains of Dahl, scientists\nisolated human DNA in bear droppings taken from the scene. They\nalso matched bear DNA from hair samples gathered at the site with\nthat of hair collected a year earlier from the female grizzly and\nher male cub by Daniel Carney, a wildlife biologist for the\nBlackfeet Tribe, when he captured them, put tags in their ears,\nclasped an electronic collar around the mother's neck and turned\nthem both loose.\n\n   Carney began collecting hair samples from all bears he trapped\naround 1995 when he realized that DNA would become an important\nidentification tool. This was the first occasion the collection was\nput to use.\n\n   When the experts matched the hair to the aggressive bears Carney\nhad tagged earlier, park and wildlife officials decided to destroy\nall three animals.\n\n   A few bear experts called the evidence circumstantial and argued\nthat the attack might have resulted from natural defensive\naggression or that the bears might have done no more than scavenge\nthe corpse.\n\n   ``Usually when they do someone in, they don't feed on him,''\nsaid Charles Jonkel, a former professor at the University of\nMontana and a noted bear authority. Given the element of doubt, he\nurged that the young female be moved and put through behavioral\nconditioning to restore her wariness of people.\n\n   But the officials decided that they could not take that chance.\nCircumstantial or not, the evidence convinced them that the bears\nhad chased Dahl for several hundred yards downhill before killing\nhim.\n\n   ``The entire family group participated in this activity,''\nServheen said. ``Offspring learn from their mother and since they\nwere involved in pursuing and eating a human, those offspring were\nlikely to do it again.''\n\n   Using dogs, helicopters and radio waves transmitted from the\nmother's collar, park rangers began hunting the bears, who had\nsplit up. The female cub was trapped on June 3, held four days as a\nlure for her brother, who had vanished into the high country, and\nthen euthanized.\n\n   The mother, wearing ear tag number 235, was found June 4 with an\nadult male grizzly and shot. At the end of the month, the young\nmale returned to the Two Medicine campground, rushed a group of 16\ntourists and then twice charged the guide before backing away just\nfeet from him. The bear departed, but was tracked down and killed\nshortly afterward.\n\n   Bear biologists were left to ponder why these apparently healthy\nanimals crossed the line to become man killers. While searching for\nan explanation, Steve Gniadek, the park's chief wildlife biologist,\nrecently compiled a dossier on Bear 235 that deepened the mystery.\n\n   After examining thin cross sections of a tooth stained to reveal\nthe dark rings that form every winter in the bonelike covering of\nthe tooth's root, scientists at Mattson Laboratory in Milltown,\nMont., placed the age of the female grizzly at 16 years, solidly\nmiddle-aged.\n\n   nn\n\n   Based on that information and the holes in her ears indicating a\nprior capture, Gniadek concluded that in all likelihood she was\nChocolate Legs, who had gotten into trouble as an 18-month-old cub.\n\n   At that age she had already lost her wariness of people and was\ncausing ``bear jams,'' as tourists stopped their cars to watch and\nphotograph her along the roadside in Many Glacier Valley in the\npark's northwest corner. Such bears, labeled ``habituated,'' forage\naround roads and homes and are considered at risk of stealing food,\ndestroying property or coming into conflict with people.\n\n   Captured in July 1983, fitted with an ear tag (number 251) and\nradio collar, Chocolate Legs was flown 20 miles southwest across\nthe Continental Divide to the remote headwaters of Pinchot Creek\nnear 10,000-foot Mount Stimson.\n\n   According to radio readings, between 1983 and 1986, she\nrepeatedly crossed the Continental Divide through the 8,000- to\n9,000-foot peaks of the Lewis Range. In 1986, she threw off the\ncollar at her den near the headwaters of Pinchot Creek. At some\npoint, the original ear tags rotted out.\n\n   For the next 11 years, Chocolate Legs apparently unobtrusively\noccupied a range that included Two Medicine, although Gniadek\nbelieves that she may have been involved in one incident in 1995 in\nwhich a pair of hikers were frightened and their packs raided for\nfood.\n\n   What is certain is that by 1997, Chocolate Legs and her cubs\nwere so habituated that they had become pushy around people. In May\n1997, the three bears boldly walked through Red Eagle campground on\nthe Blackfeet Reservation, which abuts the east side of Glacier.\n\n   It was there that Carney captured Chocolate Legs and her son,\napplied the ear tags and the collar and collected the telltale hair\nsamples. Then, he released them to a barrage of loudly exploding\n``cracker shells,'' to scare them away and help restore their\nwariness of people.\n\n   Shortly afterward, Carrie Hunt of the Wind River Bear Institute\nin Heber City, Utah, and Tim Manley, a bear management specialist\nwith the Montana Department of Fish, Game and Parks used trained\ndogs, loud noises and rubber bullets to drive the bear family from\nthe Two Medicine campground.\n\n   Through June, the mother and cubs continued to show no fear of\npeople. In July, they displayed ``strange and erratic behavior''\naround searchers looking for a missing hiker, Matthew Truszkowski,\n25, of Michigan. Later, the female came onto a trail sniffing the\nair and looking around, as if searching for Carney. In September,\nthe three bears again charged at hikers, backing away just feet\nfrom them.\n\n   After Dahl's death, some officials began to view the previous\nsummer's behavior as more ominous than it had first appeared.\nSpeculating that Chocolate Legs might have killed Truszkowski, the\nauthorities launched a new search, without success. Servheen\nsuspects that something happened in the summer of 1997 to cause\nChocolate Legs to view ``people as food.''\n\n   Other experts suggest that the key to understanding what\nhappened lies buried in the particular events of the bear's life\nand personality. But common threads are habituation and a regular\ndiet of human and pet foods.\n\n   ``If you look at bears that have killed and eaten people, except\nthose provoked by photographers, you see that they have a history\nof habituation and food conditioning,'' said Stephen Herrero,\nprofessor emeritus of environmental science at the University of\nCalgary and a leading authority on bear attacks. But, he cautioned,\n``Bears are complex, intelligent and individualistic, and so we\ncan't predict their behavior as if they were stimulus-response\nmachines.''\n\n   The case of Chocolate Legs, said Herrero, underscores the need\nfor vigilance to prevent bears from becoming habituated.\n\n   ``The amazing thing,'' Servheen added, ``is that this doesn't\nhappen more often, given that there are people all over their home\nrange.
