Earl Watson\nactually played like a point guard, passing first and shooting\nsecond, and the Bruins unveiled dark blue, road-only uniforms with\na snazzy script ``UCLA.''\n\n   But the biggest surprise of all was their inspired play.\n\n   Whether the opponent is Santa Clara or Vanderbilt, whether the\nplace is Maui or Anchorage, UCLA has a history of lethargic\nperformances in these early-season tournaments. (It hasn't won one\nsince the 1990 Great Alaska Shootout.)\n\n   But the No. 18 Bruins were in fine form Tuesday, running and\ndunking and overpowering Maine with a 83-62 victory in the first\nround of the Pearl Harbor Classic.\n\n   ``Coach (Steve Lavin) told us that UCLA has gone to tournaments\nin Maui and Alaska and Puerto Rico and not played well,'' Bruins\nforward Rico Hines said. ``We've been lackadaisical in the past,\nand our junior class has never won a tournament. We stressed all\nweek that we had to come here and execute on offense and defense.''\n\n   The Bruins broke the game open with a 33-7 surge midway through\nthe first half. Reserve guard Ryan Bailey was the catalyst, just as\nhe was against DePaul. He checked in with UCLA trailing 12-10 and\nimmediately found Watson on an alley-oop. Ten minutes later, UCLA's\nmargin was 41-19.\n\n   ``(Bailey) gave us a real lift in the first half,'' Lavin said.\n``I told him I would have gotten him more minutes (he played 17),\nbut with a comfortable lead I didn't want to push it with his\n(tendonitis).''\n\n   Bailey joined Watson and Ray Young to give the Bruins a\nthree-guard attack. They pressed and trapped and unleashed the fast\nbreak. The Black Bears happily complied by shooting quick and\nplaying fast _ a style custom-made for UCLA.\n\n   It's unlikely today's opponent, Colorado State, will let the\nBruins play at warp speed.\n\n   ``They totally took us out of anything we wanted to do with our\noffensive structure,'' said Maine coach John Giannini, whose team\nshot 32.1 percent in the first half. ``It was very difficult to run\nour offense. I couldn't have been more impressed with their defense\nin the first half.''\n\n   The second half was another matter. With a 20-point lead, the\nBruins got sloppy. Their shooting deteriorated and their defense\nwilted as Maine shot 55.6 percent.\n\n   ``That's what happened against Gonzaga,'' Lavin said. ``We're\ntrying to avoid that and get them to play with sustained intensity\nfor 40 minutes. We just lost concentration.''\n\n   The sloppy second half failed to overshadow several impressive\nperformances.\n\n   Maine power forward Nate Fox, who plays like Stanford's Mark\nMadsen but looks like Steve Forbes, led all scorers with 23 points.\n\n   UCLA forward Jason Kapono, who's one-fourth Hawaiian, made 3 of\n4 shots from 3-point range and once again played a deft floor game.\nWhen he's not on the court, it's noticeable.\n\n   Big men Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric dominated the smaller\nBlack Bears, combining for 29 points and 17 rebounds.\n\n   Barnes had eight points and a career-high 10 rebounds in 10\nminutes, although his rebound total is debatable. (The local\nstatisticians, overwhelmed by the pace, initially credited Kapono\nwith 21 minutes played in the first half.)\n\n   ``Matt exceeded my expectations in terms of how quickly he\nappeared comfortable at both ends of the floor,'' Lavin said.\n\n   Watson's makeover was remarkable. After poor decision-making and\nhorrendous shooting (4 of 24) against Gonzaga and DePaul, he\nfinally played like a point guard. The tempo probably helped _\nWatson's always more comfortable in chaos _ and perhaps Bailey's\npass-first approach is resonating.\n\n   Whatever the reason, Watson did not attempt a shot until 3:44\nremained in the first half, and he finished with 10 assists and two\nturnovers.\n\n   ``We've talked in general terms about wanting to move the ball\nquicker,'' Lavin said. ``As the point guard, Earl understands it\nbegins with him.''\n\n   Whether Watson does it against a disciplined team like Colorado\nState _ not to mention Arizona and Stanford _ remains to be seen.\nBut for one balmy afternoon on the North Shore, the Bruins had\nreason to smile.\n","Headline":"\nUCLA BEATS MAINE\n","Text":["\n   LAIE, Hawaii _ The UCLA Bruins debuted Tuesday on Oahu's famed\nNorth Shore, home of Sunset Beach and the Banzai Pipeline, and they\nbrought along a slew of surprises.\n","\n   Forward Matt Barnes, rescued from academic suspension at the\nlast minute, made his first appearance of the season.
