					<a href='#'>Gun Gifts to Samaranch Exceed $2000</a>
				</p>

				<P>
					SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The retail value of the arsenal given by  
				Salt Lake Olympics boosters to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
				exceeds $2,000. 
				</P>
				<P>
					Samaranch said today he didn't want to insult the city by  
				refusing the gifts. 
				</P>
				<P>
					``Of course, Utah is a state where guns are very popular,'' he  
				said at a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland. ``I have visited 
				Salt Lake City twice and I got a gun both times. I took it to 
				Switzerland.'' 
				</P>
				<P>
					So far, two rifles and a shotgun, all made by Browning Arms of  
				Mountain Green, Utah, have been identified as going to Samaranch 
				and there also may have been a handgun. 
				</P>
				<P>
					IOC officials say such gift-giving to the leader of the IOC is  
				commonplace. 
				</P>
				<P>
					``The exchange of gifts on the occasion of visits by the IOC  
				president is customary and it has almost become a matter of 
				protocol to do so,'' said Francois Carrard, the IOC's director 
				general. 
				</P>
				<P>
					Samaranch said he sees no problem in accepting the gifts,  
				despite IOC rules that impose a $150 limit on gifts to committee 
				members. He said the limit doesn't apply to him. 
				</P>
				<P>
					``The limit is for the members who participate in the  
				elections,'' he said. ``Now, I do not take part in the voting and 
				the elections.'' 
				</P>
				<P>
					The Tribune de Geneve today quoted Samaranch as saying, ``I went  
				to the American city twice before it was granted the 2002 Winter 
				Games. On these occasions I did indeed receive a .22 Long Rifle and 
				a Browning. 
				</P>
				<P>
					``I do remember very clearly the inscription on the case: `To  
				President Juan Antonio Samaranch on behalf of the population of 
				Salt Lake City.' These gifts were put down in a register, as is 
				required by our internal rules. They are in my office in Lausanne 
				and I am in a position to show them to any of my visitors,'' he 
				said. 
				</P>
				<P>
					At the news conference, Samaranch said the two guns were in the  
				Olympic Museum at IOC headquarters. 
				</P>
				<P>
					Carrard's comment was in response to a report Tuesday in The  
				Salt Lake Tribune that Samaranch received two guns worth $1,000 
				from the Salt Lake bid committee a month before Salt Lake won the 
				right to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
				</P>
				<P>
					The Tribune said in another copyright story today that another  
				Browning rifle also went to Samaranch. 
				</P>
				<P>
					Carrard said Samaranch was given a rifle in a case with an  
				engraved plaque that read: ``Presented to President Juan Antonio 
				Samaranch from the Browning Arms Co. on behalf of the people of 
				Salt Lake City.''
